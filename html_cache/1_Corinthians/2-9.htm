Paul often uses this formula to connect his teachings with the Hebrew Scriptures, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promises. The phrase suggests a transition from human wisdom to divine revelation, underscoring the importance of relying on God's Word rather than human understanding.<p><b>&#8220;No eye has seen,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the limitations of human perception. In biblical context, it reflects the idea that God's plans and purposes are beyond human comprehension. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>, where the prophet speaks of God's works being unseen by human eyes. It emphasizes the transcendence of God's wisdom and the inability of human senses to fully grasp His divine plans.<p><b>no ear has heard,</b><br>Continuing the theme of human limitation, this phrase suggests that God's revelations are not accessible through ordinary means of communication. In the cultural context of the time, oral tradition was a primary way of sharing knowledge, yet even this method falls short in conveying the full scope of God's intentions. This underscores the necessity of spiritual discernment and divine revelation.<p><b>no heart has imagined,</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of thought, emotion, and will. This phrase indicates that even the deepest human imagination cannot conceive the greatness of what God has in store. It points to the inadequacy of human reasoning and creativity in understanding divine mysteries, aligning with <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>, which speaks of God doing immeasurably more than we can ask or imagine.<p><b>what God has prepared</b><br>This part of the verse assures believers of God's intentional and purposeful planning. The use of "prepared" suggests a deliberate act by God, emphasizing His sovereignty and foreknowledge. It connects to the biblical theme of God's providence and the assurance that He has a plan for those who trust in Him, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>.<p><b>for those who love Him.&#8221;</b><br>The concluding phrase identifies the recipients of God's promises as those who love Him. This love is not merely an emotional response but a commitment to follow and obey God. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, as seen throughout Scripture. This love is a response to God's love for us, as articulated in 1 <a href="/john/4-19.htm">John 4:19</a>, and is a defining characteristic of true believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostle_paul.htm">Apostle Paul</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and epistles that form a significant portion of the New Testament.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality.

They are not to be found as here given anywhere in the Old Testament. It has therefore been suggested (Origen) that they are from some apocryphal book, or some book which has been lost, as is supposed many have been. Chrysostom also suggests that it may be a reference, not to a writing, but to historical facts, as in <a href="/matthew/2-23.htm" title="And he came and dwelled in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.">Matthew 2:23</a>. None of these explanations would justify the use of that phrase, "it is written," with which these words are introduced, and which in the apostolic writings is confined to quotations from the Old Testament scriptures. It is not used where the words are taken from other sources (see, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/jude/1-9.htm" title="Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.">Jude 1:9</a>; <a href="/jude/1-14.htm" title="And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his saints,">Jude 1:14</a>). Although the words given here are not to be found in the same sequence in any passage in the Old Testament, still there are phrases scattered through the writings of Isaiah (see <a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm" title="For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen, O God, beside you, what he has prepared for him that waits for him.">Isaiah 64:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm" title="For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.">Isaiah 65:17</a>; see also Isa 62:15 in the LXX.), which would easily be joined together in memory and resemble even verbally the passage as written here by the Apostle. This is not the only place in which St. Paul would seem to thus refer to the Old Testament scriptures (see <a href="/context/1_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.">1Corinthians 1:19-20</a>) when he is not basing any argument upon a particular sentence in the Scriptures, but merely availing himself of some thoughts or words in the Old Testament as an illustration of some truth which he is enforcing. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But as it is written.</span> The whole sentence in the Greek is unfinished.

Scriptural quotations are often thus introduced, apart from the general grammar of the sentence, as in the Greek of <a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Eye hath not seen,</span> etc. The Revised Version is here more literal and accurate. The quotation as it stands is not found in the Old Testament. It most resembles <a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>, but also vaguely resembles Isaiah 53:15; 65:17. It may be another instance of a loose general reminiscence (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-21.htm">1 Corinthians 14:21</a>; <a href="/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>). "Non verbum e verbo expressit," says St. Jerome, "sed <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;</span> aliis sermonibus indicavit." St. Chrysostom regards the words as part of a lost prophecy. Origen, Zacharias of Chrysopolis, and others say that the words occurred in an apocryphal book, the 'Apocalypse of Elias,' but if so the apocryphal writer must have had the passage of Isaiah in his mind. Some regard the words as a fragment of some ancient liturgy. Origen thought that they came from the 'Revelation of Elijah.' They were also to be found in the 'Ascension of Isaiah' (Jerome on <a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>). and they occur in the Talmud (Sanhedr. 99 a). In a curious fragment of Hegesippus (circ. <span class="date">A.D. 150</span>) preserved in Photius (Cod. 232.), that old writer indignantly repudiates this passage, saying that it is futile and "utterly belies (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) the Holy Scriptures and the Lord, who says, 'Blessed are your eyes which see, and your ears which hear.'" Photius cannot understand why (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>) Hegesippus should speak thus. Routh ('Rel. Sacr.,' 253) hardly knows how to excuse him; but perhaps if we had the context of the fragment we should see that he is attacking, not the words themselves, but some perversion of them by heretics, like the Docetae. The phrase, "As it is written," decisively marks an intention to refer to Scripture. Neither have entered into the heart of man; literally, <span class="accented">things which have not set foot upon the heart.</span> The general thought is that God's revelations (for the immediate reference is to <span class="accented">these</span>, and <span class="accented">not</span> to future bliss) pass all understanding. The quotation of these words as referring to heaven is one of the numberless instances of texts inaccurately applied. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Rather,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
