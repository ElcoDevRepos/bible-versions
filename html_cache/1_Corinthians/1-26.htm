The "time of your calling" refers to the moment they were called to faith in Christ. This calling is a divine initiative, highlighting God's sovereignty in salvation. In the broader biblical context, calling often signifies God's invitation to individuals to enter into a relationship with Him (<a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>). The emphasis on considering their calling serves as a reminder of God's grace and the transformative power of the gospel.<p><b>Not many of you were wise by human standards:</b><br>The Corinthian church was composed largely of individuals who were not considered wise according to worldly criteria. In the Greco-Roman world, wisdom was highly valued, often associated with philosophical knowledge and rhetorical skill. Paul contrasts human wisdom with divine wisdom, which is revealed through the message of the cross (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18-25</a>). This distinction underscores the theme that God's ways often defy human expectations and values.<p><b>Not many were powerful:</b><br>The term "powerful" refers to those with influence, authority, or social standing. In Corinth, a city known for its wealth and status, power was a significant marker of success. However, the early Christian community was largely composed of individuals without such societal power. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God often chooses the weak and marginalized to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a>).<p><b>Not many were of noble birth:</b><br>Being of noble birth implied a high social status and lineage. In the ancient world, nobility was associated with privilege and honor. The fact that few in the Corinthian church came from such backgrounds highlights the inclusive nature of the gospel, which transcends social and cultural barriers. This aligns with the biblical narrative that God does not show favoritism (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>) and often works through those whom society overlooks.<br><br>Overall, this verse emphasizes the countercultural nature of God's calling and the church's composition, which reflects God's wisdom and power rather than human standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, a city known for its diversity and moral challenges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>A diverse group of believers in Corinth, consisting of Jews and Gentiles, many of whom were not from the upper echelons of society.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth, commerce, and moral issues, providing a backdrop for the challenges faced by the early church.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_calling.htm">The Calling</a></b><br>Refers to the divine invitation to salvation and service in Christ, emphasizing God's choice rather than human merit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise,_powerful,_and_noble.htm">The Wise, Powerful, and Noble</a></b><br>Represents societal standards of wisdom, power, and nobility, which were not the primary criteria for God's calling.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_choice.htm">God's Sovereign Choice</a></b><br>God often chooses those whom the world overlooks to accomplish His purposes, highlighting His sovereignty and grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_beyond_worldly_standards.htm">Value Beyond Worldly Standards</a></b><br>Believers should find their worth and identity in Christ rather than in societal status or achievements.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_calling.htm">Humility in Calling</a></b><br>Recognizing that our calling is not based on personal merit fosters humility and gratitude towards God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>The church is a diverse body where all members, regardless of social standing, are equally valued and called to serve.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/empowerment_by_the_spirit.htm">Empowerment by the Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit empowers believers to fulfill their calling, regardless of their natural abilities or social status.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_1_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 1:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_1_26_vs_worldly_wisdom_power.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 1:26 challenge our view of worldly wisdom and power?

It has been well remarked, "the ancient Christians were, for the greater part, slaves and persons of humble rank; the whole history of the progress of the Church is in fact a gradual triumph of the unlearned over the learned, of the lowly over the great, until the emperor himself cast his crown at the foot of Christ's cross" (Olshausen); or, as an English writer puts it, "Christianity with the irresistible might of its weakness shook the world."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-31.</span> - <span class="accented">The method of God in the spread of the gospel.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For behold;</span> or, <span class="accented">consider</span> (imperative, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-15.htm">1 Corinthians 10:15</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Your calling;</span> the nature and method of your heavenly calling; the "principle God has followed in calling you" (Beza); see <a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Not many wise after the flesh.</span> Those who hear the calling arc alone the truly wise; but they are net wise with a carnal wisdom, not wise as men count wisdom; they have but little of the wisdom of the serpent and the wisdom of "this age." The Sanhedrin looked down on the apostles as "unlearned and ignorant men" (<a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>). <span class="accented">"God,"</span> says St. Augustine, "caught orators by fishermen, not fishermen by orators." <span class="cmt_word">Not many mighty</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not many persons of power and influence. Almost the first avowed Gentile Christian of the highest rank was the consul Flavius Clemens, uncle of the Emperor Domitian. This was the more marked because <span class="accented">the Jews</span> won many rich and noble proselytes, such as the Queen Helena and the royal family of Adiabene, Poppaea the wife of Nero, and others. The only illustrious converts mentioned in the New Testament are Joseph of Arimathaea, Nicodemus, Sergius Paulus, and Dionysius the Areopagitc. <span class="cmt_word">Not many noble.</span> All this was a frequent taunt against Christians, but they made it their boast. Christianity came to redeem and elevate, not the few, but the many, and the many must ever be the weak and the humble. Hence Christ called fishermen as his apostles, and was known as "the Friend of publicans and sinners." None of the rulers believed on him (<a href="/john/7-48.htm">John 7:48</a>). It must, however, be borne in mind that these words apply mainly and primarily to the first age of Christianity. It was essential that its victory should be due to Divine weapons only, and that it should shake the world "by the irresistible might of weakness." After a time, the wisest and the noblest and the most powerful were called. Kings became the nursing fathers of the gospel, and queens its nursing mothers. Yet the ideal truth remains, and human power shows utter weakness, and human wisdom is capable of sinking into the depths of folly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Brothers,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(adelphoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_80.htm">Strong's 80: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brother, member of the same religious community, especially a fellow-Christian.
