The "one loaf" symbolizes the body of Christ, which is a central theme in the New Testament. In the context of the early church, bread was a staple food, and sharing a loaf was a common practice during communal meals, including the Lord's Supper. This imagery is rooted in the Last Supper, where Jesus broke bread with His disciples, signifying His body given for them (<a href="/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26</a>). The singular loaf represents the singularity and unity of Christ's body, which believers are part of through faith.<p><b>we who are many are one body</b><br>This phrase highlights the concept of the Church as the body of Christ, a metaphor Paul frequently uses (e.g., <a href="/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>, <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>). Despite the diversity among believers&#8212;different backgrounds, gifts, and functions&#8212;they are united as one body in Christ. This unity is not just spiritual but also practical, as believers are called to live in harmony and support one another. The early church, composed of Jews and Gentiles, faced challenges in maintaining this unity, making Paul's message particularly relevant. The body metaphor underscores the interdependence of believers, each contributing to the health and function of the whole.<p><b>for we all partake of the one loaf</b><br>Partaking of the "one loaf" signifies participation in the life and sacrifice of Christ. In the context of the Lord's Supper, this act is a proclamation of faith and a reminder of the new covenant established through Jesus' death and resurrection (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23-26</a>). It also serves as a declaration of unity among believers, as they share in the same spiritual nourishment. This communal act reflects the early Christian practice of gathering for the "breaking of bread" (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>), which was both a meal and a sacred observance. The shared loaf is a tangible expression of the spiritual reality that believers are united in Christ, transcending individual differences and divisions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, a city known for its diversity and moral challenges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse group of believers facing issues of division, immorality, and idolatry, to whom Paul writes to encourage unity and holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_supper.htm">The Lord's Supper</a></b><br>The context of this passage, where believers partake of bread and wine in remembrance of Christ's sacrifice, symbolizing unity in the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>The church, though composed of many individuals, is united as one body in Christ.

Paul adds, &#8220;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body &#8230; and we were all given one Spirit to drink&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>).<p>&#8226; By taking the bread and cup, we openly confess dependency on Christ&#8217;s finished work and continual life within us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the one loaf</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; of the one loaf.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The final phrase circles back to the shared bread, driving home that our unity is anchored in a real, historic act&#8212;Christ&#8217;s body given once (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Early believers &#8220;devoted themselves &#8230; to the breaking of bread&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>), recognizing that every gathering around the loaf visibly proclaims what Christ accomplished and who we now are together.<p>&#8226; When local churches guard the purity of the Table and the truth of the gospel, the single loaf continues to testify, generation after generation, that God has made us one.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>One tangible loaf points to one crucified and risen Lord. Though believers come from many places and backgrounds, we are truly one body because each of us personally partakes of that same loaf, acknowledging our shared need and our shared Savior. The Lord&#8217;s Supper is therefore more than ritual; it is God&#8217;s ordained reminder that doctrinally, relationally, and practically, we belong to Christ&#8212;and to one another.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">For we being many are one bread.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">For it is one bread, and we, the many, are one body, for we all take a portion of that one bread.</span> This verse explains how "the breaking" of the bread was the significant act which expressed sacramentally the communion of the body of Christ. There is one bread, it is broken into many pieces, and as we all (though each receives only a fragment) partake of the one bread which unbroken consisted of these pieces, we though many individuals are one body, even the Body of Christ with whom, as well as with each other, we have communion in that act.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We being many are one bread, and one body.</span> It is easy to see how we are "one <span class="accented">body,"</span> of which Christ is the Head, and we are the members. This is the metaphor used in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12, 13</a> and <a href="/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>. The more difficult expression, "<span class="accented">we</span> <span class="accented">are one bread,"</span> is explained in the next clause. The meaning seems to be - We all partake of the loaf, and thereby become qualitatively, as it were, a part of it, as it of us, even as we all become members of Christ's one body, which that loaf sacramentally represents Some commentators, disliking the harshness of the expression, render it, "Because there is one bread, we being many are one body;" or, "For there is one bread. We being many are one body." But the language and context support the rendering of our version; and the supposed "physiology" is not so modern as to be at all surprising. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/10-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Because [there is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7991;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(heis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1520.htm">Strong's 1520: </a> </span><span class="str2">One.
