The idea of being "bought" reflects the practice of purchasing slaves or goods in the ancient world, which would have been familiar to the Corinthian audience. In a spiritual sense, it signifies that believers have been redeemed from sin and death through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ. This echoes the Old Testament concept of redemption, where God redeems Israel from slavery in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). The "price" refers to the blood of Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>, which underscores the immense value and cost of this redemption. This transaction highlights the believer's new identity and belonging to God, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a> and <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>.<p><b>Therefore glorify God with your body.</b><br>The word "therefore" indicates a response or action that should follow the understanding of being bought at a price. The call to "glorify God" is a directive to honor and reflect God's character in one's life. In the context of Corinth, a city known for its immorality and idolatry, this command would have been particularly poignant. The body, often seen as a vessel for sin in Greco-Roman culture, is here redefined as a temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>). This aligns with the biblical teaching that the physical body is not separate from spiritual life but is integral to worship and service to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The call to glorify God with one's body also connects to the broader biblical narrative of holiness and sanctification, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-4</a>, where believers are urged to live in a manner that reflects their redeemed status.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul was addressing the church in Corinth, a city known for its moral and spiritual challenges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>A diverse group of believers in Corinth, struggling with issues of immorality and division.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The one who paid the price for believers' redemption through His sacrificial death.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Indwelling believers, empowering them to live holy lives and glorify God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city_of_corinth.htm">The City of Corinth</a></b><br>A major trade city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and moral decadence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_redemption.htm">Understanding Redemption</a></b><br>Recognize that being "bought at a price" refers to the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, which redeems us from sin and its consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/body_as_a_temple.htm">Body as a Temple</a></b><br>Our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, and we are called to honor God with our physical lives, avoiding immorality and impurity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_sacrifices.htm">Living Sacrifices</a></b><br>Just as Christ gave Himself for us, we are to offer our lives in service and worship to God, reflecting His holiness in our actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holistic_worship.htm">Holistic Worship</a></b><br>Glorifying God involves every aspect of our being&#8212;spiritual, physical, and emotional.

Gratitude for redemption fuels daily choices that point all attention back to the Savior who bought us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are bought with a price</span>. That price is the blood of Christ, wherewith he purchased the Church (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18, 19</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>). This metaphor of ransom (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-23.htm">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>) has its full and absolute applicability to man. The effect of Christ's death for us is that we are redeemed from slavery and prison, and the right of our possession is with Christ. Thus by various metaphors the effects of redemption are revealed to us on the human side. When we unduly <span class="accented">press</span> the metaphor, and ask <span class="accented">from whom</span> we were purchased, and <span class="accented">to whom</span> the price was paid, we build up scholastic systems which have only led to error, and respecting which the Church has never sanctioned any exclusive opinion. The thoughts touched upon in this verse are fully developed in the Epistle to the Romans. <span class="cmt_word">Glorify God;</span> by behaving as his redeemed children, and therefore by keeping yourselves pure. In these few brief words St. Paul <span class="accented">sums up</span> all he has said, as he did in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-13.htm">1 Corinthians 5:13</a>. In your body. The following words, "and in your spirit, which are God's," are a perfectly correct and harmless gloss, but are not found in the best manuscripts, and are foreign to the drift of the passage. Your body is a temple, and in that temple God must be honoured. (As Augustine says, "Dost thou wish to pray in a temple? pray in thyself. But first <span class="accented">be</span> a temple of God.") "Unchastity dishonours God, and that in his own temple (<a href="/romans/2-23.htm">Romans 2:23</a>)" (Meyer). In these clauses St. Paul has touched on three subjects which occupy important sections of the remainder of the Epistle, namely, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the relation between the sexes (ch. 7.); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the question of idol offerings (ch. 8.); and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the doctrine of the resurrection (ch. 15.).  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">you were bought</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7968;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#940;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;gorasth&#275;te)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_59.htm">Strong's 59: </a> </span><span class="str2">To buy.
