In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul addresses divisions within the church at Corinth, where members were aligning themselves with different leaders (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>). By stating that those who plant and water are one, Paul underscores that all Christian workers, regardless of their specific roles, share a common goal: the growth of God's kingdom. This unity reflects the body of Christ, where each member has a unique function but works together for the same purpose (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>). The agricultural metaphor of planting and watering would have been familiar to the Corinthian audience, as agriculture was a significant part of their economy and daily life.<p><b>and each will be rewarded according to his own labor</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the principle of individual accountability and reward. In the broader biblical context, this aligns with the teaching that God is just and will reward each person based on their deeds (<a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>). The concept of reward is not necessarily about salvation, which is a gift of grace, but about the recognition of faithful service (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-14.htm">1 Corinthians 3:14</a>). The imagery of labor and reward also connects to the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where servants are rewarded based on their stewardship.
