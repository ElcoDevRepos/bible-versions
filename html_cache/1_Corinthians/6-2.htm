The concept of saints judging the world is rooted in eschatological teachings found in both the Old and New Testaments. <a href="/daniel/7-22.htm">Daniel 7:22</a> speaks of the "Ancient of Days" coming and judgment being given to the saints. In the New Testament, <a href="/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4-6</a> describes the saints reigning with Christ during the millennial kingdom. This role of judgment is not about condemnation but about ruling and administering God's justice. The term "saints" refers to all believers, emphasizing their sanctified status through Christ. This future responsibility underscores the dignity and authority bestowed upon believers, encouraging them to live righteously in the present.<p><b>And if you are to judge the world,</b><br>This phrase reinforces the certainty of the saints' future role. The use of "if" is rhetorical, affirming the truth of the statement. The context of <a href="/1_corinthians/6.htm">1 Corinthians 6</a> is addressing disputes among believers in Corinth, urging them to resolve issues internally rather than seeking secular courts. The assurance of future judgment responsibilities serves as a reminder of the wisdom and discernment believers are expected to cultivate. This expectation is consistent with Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>, where He promises the apostles they will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. The phrase challenges believers to reflect on their spiritual maturity and readiness for such a role.<p><b>are you not competent to judge trivial cases?</b><br>Here, Paul contrasts the significant future role of judging the world with the relatively minor disputes among believers. The term "trivial cases" refers to everyday disagreements and legal matters that should be resolved within the Christian community. This reflects the early church's emphasis on unity and self-governance, as seen in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-7</a>, where the apostles appointed deacons to handle practical matters. The rhetorical question implies that believers, endowed with the Holy Spirit and guided by Scripture, possess the necessary wisdom to resolve such issues. This competence is not based on human ability but on the transformative work of Christ and the indwelling Spirit, as highlighted in passages like 1 <a href="/john/2-20.htm">John 2:20</a>, which speaks of the anointing that teaches believers all things.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance and correction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled early Christian community dealing with internal disputes and moral issues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_saints.htm">The Saints</a></b><br>Refers to believers in Christ, who are set apart for God's purposes and are called to live holy lives.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The act of making decisions or forming opinions, particularly in a legal or moral context.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>In this context, it refers to the secular world outside the church, which will ultimately be judged by God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_future_role.htm">Understanding Our Future Role</a></b><br>Believers are called to a future role of judgment, which should influence how we live and make decisions today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/competence_in_judgment.htm">Competence in Judgment</a></b><br>If we are to judge the world, we should be able to handle disputes within the church with wisdom and discernment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_saints.htm">Living as Saints</a></b><br>Our identity as saints should reflect in our daily lives, striving for holiness and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/resolving_conflicts_internally.htm">Resolving Conflicts Internally</a></b><br>The church should aim to resolve disputes internally, reflecting unity and maturity in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_eternal_responsibilities.htm">Preparation for Eternal Responsibilities</a></b><br>Our current lives are a preparation for our eternal roles; we should seek to grow in wisdom and understanding.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_6_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 6:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_6_2_on_believers_settling_disputes.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 6:2 encourage believers to resolve disputes among themselves?

If Christians will one day handle matters of global significance, they should readily settle everyday disputes.<p>&#8226; The immediate context shows believers were taking one another to secular courts (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-1.htm">1 Corinthians 6:1</a>).

The verse calls believers to live today as those already appointed to reign tomorrow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Do</span> <span class= "bld">ye not</span> <span class= "bld">know . . . ?</span>--The knowledge which they possessed of the great future which was in store for the Church of Christ was the strongest argument against the humiliating degradation to which their conduct was subjecting it.<p><span class= "bld">The saints shall judge the world.</span>--The Apostle here claims for all Christians the glorious prerogative which Christ had Himself promised to His immediate personal followers (<a href="/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a>; <a href="/luke/22-30.htm" title="That you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Luke 22:30</a>). Bearing in mind the deep conviction of the early Church that the second personal advent of Christ was near at hand, we may take these words as referring primarily to the conquest of the world by Christianity, which has since been accomplished, though by slower and more spiritual processes than were then anticipated, and indirectly to that final triumph of Christ and His body, the Church, of which every success here on earth is at once the type and the pledge.<p><span class= "bld">To judge the smallest matters.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to pronounce the most trivial judgments,</span> as compared with the great judgments which you shall pronounce hereafter.

It was a fitting rebuke to those who took for knowledge their obvious ignorance. It resembles the "Have ye not so much as read?" to Pharisees who professed such profound familiarity with the Scriptures. <span class="cmt_word">That the saints shall judge the world</span>. So Daniel (<a href="/daniel/7-22.htm">Daniel 7:22</a>) had said, "The Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High." Our Lord had confirmed this promise to his apostles, "Ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel" (<a href="/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>). Various modes of evading the literal sense have been adopted, but even in the Book of Wisdom we find, "They [the righteous] shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people" (Wisd. 3:8).
