In the cultural context of the first century, widows often faced financial and social challenges. The unmarried, which may include those who have never married or those who are divorced, also had distinct social standings. Paul&#8217;s guidance is pastoral, aiming to provide practical advice for living a Christian life in a society that often marginalized these groups. The early church was a place where such individuals could find community and support, reflecting the inclusive nature of the gospel.<p><b>It is good for them to remain unmarried,</b><br>Paul suggests that remaining unmarried can be beneficial. This advice is given in light of the "present distress" mentioned later in the chapter, which may refer to persecution or other societal pressures. By remaining unmarried, individuals could potentially devote more time and energy to serving the Lord without the added responsibilities of a family. This echoes Jesus&#8217; teaching in <a href="/matthew/19-12.htm">Matthew 19:12</a>, where He speaks of those who choose to live as eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The emphasis is on the freedom and focus that singleness can provide in serving God.<p><b>as I am.</b><br>Paul uses his own life as an example, indicating that he himself is unmarried. This personal testimony adds weight to his advice, as he speaks from experience. Paul&#8217;s singleness allowed him to travel extensively and establish churches throughout the Roman Empire, demonstrating the advantages of an undivided commitment to ministry. His life exemplifies the potential for single individuals to have a significant impact on the spread of the gospel. This also connects to the broader biblical theme of God using individuals in various life situations to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the lives of other unmarried figures like Jeremiah and John the Baptist.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, providing guidance on matters of marriage and singleness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unmarried.htm">The Unmarried</a></b><br>Refers to those who are not currently married, which may include those who have never married or those who are divorced.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_widows.htm">The Widows</a></b><br>Women whose husbands have died, a group that Paul specifically addresses in this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>The recipients of this letter, a diverse and often troubled congregation in a major Greek city known for its immorality and idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A significant city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth, commerce, and moral challenges, which influenced the issues faced by the church there.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_singleness.htm">The Value of Singleness</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes that singleness is a good and honorable state, allowing for undivided devotion to the Lord.

Widows are here joined with those who have not been married, otherwise discussion might have arisen as to whether the Apostle had intended his advice for them also. It has been curiously conjectured (by Luther amongst others), from the passage where St. Paul recommends widows to "abide even as I." that the Apostle was himself a widower. This, however, requires the word "unmarried" to be restricted to widowers, which is quite inadmissible; and even if such were admissible, the deduction from it that St. Paul was a widower could scarcely be considered logical. The almost universal tradition of the early Church was that St. Paul was never married, and unless we can imagine his having been married, and his wife dead before the stoning of St. Stephen which is scarcely possible (<a href="/acts/7-58.htm" title="And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.">Acts 7:58</a>), the truth of that tradition is evident. (See <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm" title="And I entreat you also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life.">Philippians 4:3</a>.)
