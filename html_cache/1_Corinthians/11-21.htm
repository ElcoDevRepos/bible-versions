This practice was intended to foster unity and fellowship among believers. However, in Corinth, the wealthier members of the congregation were eating their own meals without waiting for others, particularly the poorer members, who might have had little or nothing to eat. This behavior contradicted the spirit of the Lord's Supper, which is meant to symbolize the unity and equality of all believers in Christ. The selfishness displayed here is a direct violation of the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized love and service to others (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>). The act of going ahead without sharing reflects a lack of discernment of the body of Christ, which Paul later addresses in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-29.htm">1 Corinthians 11:29</a>.<p><b>While one remains hungry, another gets drunk.</b><br>This phrase highlights the disparity and lack of consideration among the Corinthian believers. The early church often met in homes, and the host would provide the meal. In a society with significant class divisions, it was common for wealthier individuals to have more food and drink available. The fact that some were getting drunk while others remained hungry indicates a severe lack of love and respect within the community. Drunkenness is condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>, <a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>) as it leads to a loss of self-control and is contrary to the fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). This behavior not only disrespects the sacredness of the Lord's Supper but also fails to reflect the sacrificial love of Christ, who gave Himself for all. The situation in Corinth serves as a warning against allowing social and economic differences to disrupt the unity and purpose of the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing issues within the Corinthian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse Christian community in Corinth struggling with various issues, including divisions and improper conduct during the Lord's Supper.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_supper.htm">The Lord's Supper</a></b><br>A Christian practice commemorating Jesus' Last Supper with His disciples, intended as a time of unity and reflection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_body_of_christ.htm">Unity in the Body of Christ</a></b><br>The Lord's Supper is a time to remember Christ's sacrifice and to express unity among believers.

The gathering itself is not the problem; it is what happens during it. Scripture repeatedly treats shared meals as sacred spaces that bind God&#8217;s people together&#8212;see <a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>, &#8220;They broke bread from house to house and partook of food with glad and sincere hearts.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s Table should mirror such unity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>each of you goes ahead</b><p>The phrase uncovers a heart issue: impatience and self-interest. Instead of waiting for one another, each person rushes to satisfy personal appetite. Compare <a href="/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1</a>, &#8220;We who are strong ought to bear with the shortcomings of the weak and not to please ourselves.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s Supper was never meant to be a race to the first plate; it is a testimony of mutual care.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>without sharing his meal</b><p>Failing to share contradicts the gospel&#8217;s call to generous fellowship. <a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32</a> notes, &#8220;All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own.&#8221; When believers hoard, they misrepresent Christ, who &#8220;did not come to be served, but to serve&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>While one remains hungry</b><p>Real, physical needs went unmet right in the middle of a worship setting. <a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-16</a> echoes Paul&#8217;s concern: &#8220;If one of you says to him, &#8216;Go in peace; stay warm and well fed,&#8217; but does nothing&#8230; what good is that?&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s Table should eliminate hunger, not expose it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>another gets drunk</b><p>At the same table where some had nothing, others indulged to excess. This contrasts sharply with <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>, &#8220;Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to reckless indiscretion.&#8221; Drunkenness not only dulls discernment; it mocks the sacrificial blood symbolized by the cup.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Verse 21 exposes a fractured fellowship: hurried self-gratification, unwillingness to share, neglect of the needy, and indulgent excess. Paul&#8217;s remedy is implicit&#8212;return to Christ-centered love that waits, shares, feeds, and exercises self-control. In doing so, the Lord&#8217;s Supper once again proclaims &#8220;one bread, one body&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-17.htm">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>) and honors the Lord it remembers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">For.</span>--Here follows a description of the conduct and mode of proceeding at this feast, which renders it impossible, as stated in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20</a>, for it to be a Lord's Supper. Every one greedily seizes (takes before distribution is made) what he has brought with him, and appropriates it to his own individual use, instead of making it a contribution to the general and common supply. Every one comes to eat <span class= "ital">his own supper,</span> and not the <span class= "ital">Lord's Supper.</span> And the result is that while some poor man, who has not been able to bring enough for himself, remains unfed, some rich man, drinking the wine which he brought, and which he has not shared with others, is drunken. (See Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/11-34.htm" title="And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that you come not together to condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.">1Corinthians 11:34</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For in eating;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in your eating.<span class="cmt_word"></span> Every one.</span> All who have themselves contributed a share to the common meal. <span class="cmt_word">Taketh before other his own supper</span>. It is as if they had come together only to eat, not to partake of a holy sacrament. The abuse rose from the connection of the Lord's Supper with the <span class="accented">agape</span>, or love feast, a social gathering of Christian brothers, to which each, as in the Greek <span class="accented">eranoi</span>, or "club feasts," contributed his share. The abuse led to the separation of the <span class="accented">agape</span> from the Holy Communion, and ultimately to the entire disuse of the former at religious gatherings. <span class="cmt_word">One is hungry.</span> The poor man, who has been unable to contribute to the meal which was intended to be an exhibition of Christian love, looked on with grudging eyes and craving appetite, while the rich had more than enough. <span class="cmt_word">Is drunken.</span> "St. Paul draws the picture in strong colours, and who can say that the reality was less strong?" (Meyer). Calvin says, "It is portentous that Satan should have accomplished so much in so short a time." But the remark was, perhaps, dictated by the wholly mistaken fancy that the Church of the apostolic days was exceptionally pure. On the contrary, many of the heathen converts were unable at once to break the spell of their old habits, and few modern Churches present a spectacle so deplorable as that which we here find in the apostolic Church of Corinth. It is quite obvious that Church discipline must have been almost in abeyance if such grave scandals could exist uncorrected and apparently unreproved. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/11-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
