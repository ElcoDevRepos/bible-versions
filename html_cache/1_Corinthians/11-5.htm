This indicates that women had active roles in the spiritual life of the community. The mention of prophesying suggests a context where the gifts of the Spirit were in operation, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17-18</a>, where both sons and daughters are said to prophesy. This participation aligns with the broader biblical narrative of women like Deborah (Judges 4-5) and Anna (<a href="/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36-38</a>) who were recognized for their spiritual contributions.<p><b>with her head uncovered</b><br>In the cultural context of Corinth, a head covering was a sign of modesty and respectability for women. It symbolized a woman's marital status and her respect for her husband. The absence of a head covering could be interpreted as a sign of rebellion against social norms or a rejection of authority. This practice is rooted in the customs of the time, where head coverings were common in both Jewish and Greco-Roman societies.<p><b>dishonors her head</b><br>The term "head" here can be understood both literally and metaphorically. Literally, it refers to the physical head of the woman. Metaphorically, it refers to her husband or the male authority in her life, as suggested by the broader context of <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>, which discusses the headship order of God, Christ, man, and woman. The dishonor comes from acting in a way that disrupts the established order and brings shame upon her head, both physically and relationally.<p><b>for it is just as if her head were shaved</b><br>In the ancient world, a shaved head was often a sign of disgrace or mourning. For a woman, it could signify punishment or shame, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12</a>, where a captive woman shaves her head as part of a purification process. In Corinthian society, a shaved head might also associate a woman with prostitution, as temple prostitutes in some pagan religions were known to shave their heads. Thus, praying or prophesying without a head covering was equated with bringing shame upon oneself, akin to the disgrace of having a shaved head.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing issues within the Corinthian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled early Christian community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/women_in_the_early_church.htm">Women in the Early Church</a></b><br>The focus of this verse, particularly regarding their conduct in worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_practices_in_corinth.htm">Cultural Practices in Corinth</a></b><br>The societal norms and expectations regarding head coverings for women.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_and_prophecy.htm">Prayer and Prophecy</a></b><br>Spiritual activities mentioned in the verse, indicating active participation in worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_cultural_context.htm">Understanding Cultural Context</a></b><br>Recognize the cultural significance of head coverings in Corinth and how it relates to honor and shame.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_women_in_worship.htm">Role of Women in Worship</a></b><br>Acknowledge that women were active participants in prayer and prophecy, indicating their valued role in the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_head_coverings.htm">Symbolism of Head Coverings</a></b><br>Explore the symbolic meaning of head coverings as a sign of authority and respect within the church setting.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_established_order.htm">Respect for Established Order</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of respecting established church practices and traditions as a form of honoring God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/application_in_modern_context.htm">Application in Modern Context</a></b><br>Consider how cultural expressions of respect and honor can be applied today, while maintaining the principle of honoring God and others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_11_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 11:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_11_5_on_head_coverings_in_worship.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 11:5 address the importance of head coverings in worship?

Scripture shows that women did participate in these ministries: Philip&#8217;s four daughters &#8220;prophesied&#8221; (<a href="/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a>), and the Spirit was poured out on &#8220;your sons and daughters&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>). So the issue here is not whether women may pray or prophesy, but how they do so in a way that honors God&#8217;s order (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p>Key truths<p>&#8226; Ministry gifts are distributed to both men and women (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), yet exercised under God&#8217;s structure (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The context is corporate worship, the same setting in which Paul later calls for orderly tongues and prophecy (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26&#8211;33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with her head uncovered</b><p>The head covering is a real, physical symbol. Paul treats it as an outward sign of a spiritual reality: authority and submission (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-10.htm">1 Corinthians 11:10</a>). Throughout Scripture, outward symbols often accompany inward truths&#8212;think of circumcision (<a href="/genesis/17-11.htm">Genesis 17:11</a>) or baptism (<a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>). Here, the covering functions much like modest apparel does in <a href="/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9</a>, visibly displaying a heart of humility.<p>Why the covering matters<p>&#8226; It distinguishes a woman&#8217;s role from a man&#8217;s, reflecting the creation order (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; It testifies to angels, heavenly witnesses who observe worship gatherings (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-10.htm">1 Corinthians 11:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; It prevents confusion in the assembly, guarding purity of worship (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>dishonors her head</b><p>&#8220;Her head&#8221; points back to verse 3: &#8220;the head of the woman is man.&#8221; To appear uncovered is to disregard the God-given authority relationship between husband and wife (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>) and, by extension, Christ&#8217;s authority over the church (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Dishonor is not merely personal embarrassment; it offends the order God established (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p>&#8226; A public act of worship that disregards God&#8217;s pattern nullifies the good that prayer or prophecy might otherwise accomplish (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for it is just as if her head were shaved</b><p>In Paul&#8217;s world, a shaved head signified shame or disciplinary disgrace (<a href="/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4</a>). By equating uncovering with shaving, Paul underscores the seriousness of the matter.<p>&#8226; The comparison shows that casting off the covering is an act of rebellion, not harmless preference (<a href="/numbers/5-18.htm">Numbers 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The shaved-head image warns that disregarding God&#8217;s symbols invites reproach from both church and society (<a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5</a> teaches that when women participate vocally in gathered worship, they are to do so with a visible sign of submission&#8212;a head covering&#8212;so that their ministry honors God&#8217;s created order. Removing the covering rejects that order and brings shame on the woman, her earthly head, and ultimately Christ. The principle endures: God calls His people to worship in ways that display humility, recognize authority, and uphold the beauty of His design.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">But every woman that prayeth . . .</span> From the hypothetical case of the man praying or preaching with covered head (which was mentioned first for the sake of introducing the antithesis), the Apostle comes now to the actual case of which he has to treat, viz., the woman uncovering her head. At first sight the permission here implied for a woman to pray and teach in public may seem at variance with the teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-34.htm" title="Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also said the law.">1Corinthians 14:34</a>, where she is commanded to observe silence, and the injunction in <a href="/1_timothy/2-12.htm" title="But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.">1Timothy 2:12</a>, that women should not "teach." In these passages, however, it is the public meeting of the whole Church that is spoken of, and in such the women were to be silent--but the meetings spoken of here, though public as distinguished from the private devotions of individuals, were probably only smaller gatherings such as are indicated in <a href="/romans/14-5.htm" title="One man esteems one day above another: another esteems every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.">Romans 14:5</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-5.htm" title=" Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.">Colossians 4:5</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-2.htm" title="And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:">Philemon 1:2</a>.
