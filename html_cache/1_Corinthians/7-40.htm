In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/7.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>, Paul discusses marriage, singleness, and celibacy, offering guidance to the Corinthian church. His advice is based on the present circumstances of the church, which faced persecution and societal challenges. The phrase "in my judgment" indicates Paul's personal opinion, yet it is informed by his apostolic authority and understanding of the Christian life. The idea that a widow "is happier if she remains as she is" suggests that singleness can offer a greater focus on spiritual matters without the distractions of marital responsibilities. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where marriage was often seen as a social obligation, but Paul emphasizes the value of undivided devotion to the Lord, as seen earlier in the chapter (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-32.htm">1 Corinthians 7:32-35</a>).<p><b>And I think that I too have the Spirit of God.</b><br>Paul asserts his confidence in his spiritual discernment, affirming that his guidance is not merely human wisdom but is influenced by the Holy Spirit. This statement underscores the authority of his teachings, aligning them with divine inspiration. The phrase reflects the broader biblical theme of the Holy Spirit guiding believers into truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). It also connects to the idea of spiritual gifts and discernment discussed in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>, where Paul elaborates on the role of the Spirit in the life of the church. By stating "I too have the Spirit of God," Paul aligns himself with other spiritual leaders and prophets who are led by the Spirit, reinforcing the legitimacy of his counsel to the Corinthians.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Corinthians, providing guidance on marriage and singleness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled early Christian community in Corinth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/widows.htm">Widows</a></b><br>Specifically addressed in this verse, as Paul discusses their state and potential remarriage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_god.htm">The Spirit of God</a></b><br>Referenced by Paul as the source of his judgment and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/contentment_in_singleness.htm">Contentment in Singleness</a></b><br>Paul suggests that a widow may be happier remaining single, emphasizing the value of contentment in one's current state.

With the words, &#8220;In my judgment, however,&#8221; he offers pastoral counsel, not a legalistic command.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-6.htm">1 Corinthians 7:6&#8211;7</a> shows the same pattern&#8212;permission to marry, yet counsel to remain single.<p>&#8226; He distinguishes between his apostolic command (&#8220;I, not the Lord,&#8221; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm">1 Corinthians 7:12</a>) and a Spirit-guided opinion aimed at the believer&#8217;s good.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a> reminds us that wise counsel protects; Paul is functioning as that counselor here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she is happier if she remains as she is</b><p>The line reads in full: &#8220;she is happier if she remains as she is.&#8221; Paul believes singleness will yield greater contentment for the widow under Corinth&#8217;s present pressures (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Remaining single allows undivided devotion to the Lord (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-32.htm">1 Corinthians 7:32&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; A widow &#8220;left all alone&#8221; can set her hope on God and persist in prayer (<a href="/1_timothy/5-5.htm">1 Timothy 5:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Freedom from marital obligations may spare her the &#8220;distress&#8221; of the times (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-28.htm">1 Corinthians 7:28</a>).<p>Yet this is counsel, not compulsion. If she chooses to remarry &#8220;in the Lord,&#8221; she does not sin (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-39.htm">1 Corinthians 7:39&#8211;40</a>). Scripture holds both paths as righteous, while calling one &#8220;happier&#8221; under certain circumstances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I think that I too have the Spirit of God</b><p>Paul closes with a gentle yet firm assertion of Spirit-given authority.<p>&#8226; Earlier he wrote, &#8220;We have the mind of Christ&#8221; (1 <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a>), stressing that his teaching flows from the Spirit.<p>&#8226; Jesus promised the Spirit would guide His apostles into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>); Paul claims that promise here.<p>&#8226; By saying &#8220;I too,&#8221; he reminds the Corinthians that their own spiritual gifts (1 <a href="/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5&#8211;7</a>) do not eclipse his apostolic role. His counsel therefore carries divine weight, even when labeled as personal judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s Spirit-guided opinion is that a widow will enjoy greater happiness and freedom for devoted service if she stays single, especially in challenging times. This advice is tender and pastoral, not a legal requirement, yet it comes with apostolic authority. The widow is free to choose; whichever path she walks in obedience to Christ will be honored, but Paul points to singleness as the sweeter blessing in the present situation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Happier.</span> Freer from cares, distractions, and entanglements.
