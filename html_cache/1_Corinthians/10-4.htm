The "spiritual drink" signifies the water that God provided from the rock at Horeb (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>) and later at Kadesh (<a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>). This drink is termed "spiritual" because it was supernaturally provided and symbolized God's sustaining presence. The provision of water in the desert is a type of Christ, who offers living water (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>), signifying eternal life and spiritual sustenance.<p><b>for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them,</b><br>The "spiritual rock" is a typological reference to Christ, who is seen as the source of spiritual sustenance. The rock "accompanied them" suggests God's continual presence and provision throughout the Israelites' journey. In Jewish tradition, there was a belief that a literal rock followed the Israelites, providing water. Paul uses this imagery to illustrate Christ's constant presence and provision for believers. This aligns with the understanding of Christ as the cornerstone (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>) and the foundation of faith.<p><b>and that rock was Christ.</b><br>Paul explicitly identifies the rock as Christ, emphasizing the pre-existence and active involvement of Christ in the Old Testament. This typology highlights Christ as the source of life and sustenance, both physically and spiritually. It underscores the continuity of God's plan of salvation from the Old Testament to the New Testament. The identification of Christ as the rock also connects to other scriptural references where Christ is depicted as a rock or stone, such as in <a href="/1_peter/2-4.htm">1 Peter 2:4-8</a>, where He is described as the living stone, rejected by men but chosen by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and wandered in the wilderness for forty years.

He now adds, &#8220;and they all drank the same spiritual drink&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>). Every Israelite&#8212;regardless of tribe, age, or status&#8212;shared in God-given refreshment.<p>&#8226; The drink was literal water in the wilderness, but Paul calls it &#8220;spiritual&#8221; because it came by God&#8217;s direct intervention (<a href="/exodus/15-25.htm">Exodus 15:25</a>; 17:6).<p>&#8226; By calling it &#8220;the same,&#8221; he reminds the Corinthians that everyone in the covenant community enjoys identical privileges&#8212;just as believers today are &#8220;all made to drink of one Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus later invites anyone who is thirsty to come to Him and drink, promising &#8220;streams of living water&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>), echoing this theme of supernatural provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For they drank from the spiritual rock</b><p>The apostle reaches back to the two well-known events where Moses struck the rock and water gushed out (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The rock was physical granite, yet Paul again labels it &#8220;spiritual&#8221; because its supply went beyond geology; it was an act of grace pointing to a deeper reality (<a href="/psalms/78-15.htm">Psalm 78:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The sufficiency of that water pictures how God never fails to meet the needs of His people (<a href="/nehemiah/9-20.htm">Nehemiah 9:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; By highlighting this &#8220;drinking,&#8221; Paul warns the Corinthians that sharing in ordinances like the Lord&#8217;s Supper does not guarantee obedience; Israel&#8217;s blessings did not prevent later judgment (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That accompanied them</b><p>Ancient Jewish tradition spoke of a rock that rolled alongside the camp. Whether Paul alludes to that idea or simply to God&#8217;s continual provision, the point is clear: the source of life-giving water was always present.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s presence &#8220;went before them by day and night&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>), and He &#8220;followed&#8221; them in protective care (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31-33</a>).<p>&#8226; The imagery anticipates Jesus&#8217; promise, &#8220;Surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p>&#8226; For the Corinthians, surrounded by pagan temples, the assurance that the Lord accompanies His people would encourage faithfulness amid pressure (<a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That rock was Christ</b><p>Paul identifies the pre-incarnate Son as the true source behind the water.<p>&#8226; Christ, the eternal Word (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>), was actively shepherding Israel long before Bethlehem.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly calls the Lord a &#8220;rock&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). Jesus fulfills that title, becoming the cornerstone for believers and a stone of stumbling for the disobedient (<a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; At Calvary the Rock was &#8220;struck&#8221; once and for all (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>). Out of His pierced side flowed blood and water (<a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>), signifying the everlasting supply of cleansing and life.<p>&#8226; By equating Christ with the wilderness rock, Paul shows that refusal to trust and obey Him brings the same consequences Israel faced, while surrender brings unending refreshment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a> teaches that the entire nation of Israel literally drank water miraculously provided by God, yet that event pointed to a deeper, spiritual reality: the pre-incarnate Christ Himself was their sustaining Rock, continually present and wholly sufficient. Paul reminds believers that we share the same privilege&#8212;one Spirit, one Savior, one unfailing source of life&#8212;and therefore must walk in grateful obedience, confident that the Rock who followed Israel now lives within us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">That spiritual Rock that followed them.</span>--There was a Jewish tradition that the Rock--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a fragment broken off from the rock smitten by Moses--followed the Israelites through their journey, and St. Paul, for the purpose of illustration, adopts that account instead of the statement in <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm" title="And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.">Numbers 20:11</a>. The emphatic repetition of the word "spiritual" before "drink" and "rock" reminds the reader that it is the spiritual and not the historic aspect of the fact which is present to St. Paul's mind. The traditional account of the Rock was a more complete illustration of the abiding presence of God, which was the point that the Apostle here desires to bring forward.<p><span class= "bld">And that Rock was Christ.</span>--As Christ was "God manifest in the flesh" in the New Dispensation, so God manifest in the Rock (the source of sustaining life) was the Christ of the Old Dispensation. The Jews had become familiar with the thought of God as a Rock. (See <a href="/1_samuel/2-2.htm" title="There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside you: neither is there any rock like our God.">1Samuel 2:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/91-12.htm" title="They shall bear you up in their hands, lest you dash your foot against a stone.">Psalm 91:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm" title="And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.">Isaiah 32:2</a>.) Though the Jews may have recognised the Rock poetically as God, they knew not that it was, as a manifestation of God's presence, typical of <span class= "ital">the</span> manifestation which was yet to be given in the Incarnation. Such seems to be the force of the statement and of the word "But" which emphatically introduces it. <span class= "ital">But</span> though they thought it only a Rock, or applied the word poetically to Jehovah, that Rock <span class= "ital">was</span> Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The same spiritual drink.</span> The water from the smitten rock might (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>) be called a "spiritual" drink, both as being a miraculous gift (comp. <a href="/galatians/4-29.htm">Galatians 4:29</a>, where Isaac is said to be "born <span class="accented">after the spirit"</span>), and as being a type of that "living water" which "springs up into everlasting life" (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>; <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>), and of the blood of Christ in the Eucharist (<a href="/john/6-55.htm">John 6:55</a>). These "waters in the wilderness" and "rivers in the desert" were a natural symbol of the grace of God (<a href="/isaiah/43-23.htm">Isaiah 43:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>), especially as bestowed in the sacrament through material signs. <span class="cmt_word">They drank;</span> literally, <span class="accented">they were drinking</span>, implying a <span class="accented">continuous</span> gift. <span class="cmt_word">Of that spiritual Rock that followed them;</span> rather, literally, <span class="accented">of a spiritual following Rock.</span> This is explained <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a mere figure of speech, in which the natural rock which Moses smote is left out of sight altogether; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as meaning that not the rock, but the water from the rock, followed after them in their wanderings (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-21.htm">Deuteronomy 9:21</a>). There can, however, be little or no doubt that St. Paul refers to the common Jewish Hagadah, that the actual material rock did follow the Israelites in their wanderings. The rabbis said that it was round, and rolled itself up like a swarm of bees, and that, when the tabernacle was pitched, this rock came and settled in its vestibule, and began to flow when the princes came to it and sang, "Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it" (<a href="/numbers/21-17.htm">Numbers 21:17</a>). It does not, of course, follow from this allusion that St. Paul, or even the rabbis, believed their Hagadah <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">other than a metaphorical sense.</span> The Jewish Hagadoth - legends and illustrations and inferences of an imaginative Oriental people - are not to be taken <span class="accented">au pied de la lettre.</span> St. Paul obviates the laying of any stress on the mere legend by the qualifying word, "a <span class="accented">spiritual</span> Rock." <span class="cmt_word">And that Rock was Christ.</span> The writings of Philo, and the Alexandrian school of thought in general, had familiarized all Jewish readers with language of this kind. They were accustomed to see types of God, or of the Word (<span class="accented">Logos</span>), in almost every incident of the deliverance from Egypt and the wanderings in the wilderness. Thus in Wisd. 10:15 and Wisdom 11:4 it is Wisdom - another form of the <span class="accented">Logos</span> - who leads and supports the Israelites.
