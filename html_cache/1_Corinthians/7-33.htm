The term "married man" refers to those who have entered into the covenant of marriage, a sacred institution established by God in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>. This covenant involves a commitment to one's spouse, which inherently brings about certain obligations and duties. The married man is contrasted with the unmarried man, who can focus more singularly on spiritual matters without the added responsibilities of a family.<p><b>is concerned about the affairs of this world</b><br>The phrase "affairs of this world" refers to the practical and everyday responsibilities that come with marriage. These include providing for the family, maintaining a household, and engaging in societal duties. In the cultural context of Corinth, a bustling trade city, these affairs could involve business dealings, social obligations, and community involvement. The "world" here is not necessarily negative but denotes the temporal and earthly aspects of life that require attention and care.<p><b>how he can please his wife</b><br>Pleasing one's wife is a central aspect of the marital relationship, emphasizing the importance of love, care, and mutual respect. <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-33</a> expands on this by instructing husbands to love their wives as Christ loved the church, highlighting the sacrificial nature of this love. In the historical context, pleasing one's wife would involve ensuring her well-being, security, and happiness, which were crucial in a patriarchal society where women often depended on their husbands for protection and provision. This phrase underscores the biblical principle of selflessness and service within marriage, reflecting Christ's love for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on marriage and singleness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled early Christian community dealing with issues of morality, spiritual gifts, and church unity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/married_believers.htm">Married Believers</a></b><br>The specific group Paul is addressing in this verse, focusing on their responsibilities and concerns.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_marital_responsibilities.htm">Understanding Marital Responsibilities</a></b><br>Marriage involves a shift in focus from individual concerns to the well-being of one's spouse.

Just a verse earlier he noted, &#8220;The unmarried man is concerned about the work of the Lord, how he can please the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-32.htm">1 Corinthians 7:32</a>). By opening with &#8220;But,&#8221; he shifts the focus: marriage introduces a different set of priorities. Jesus Himself acknowledged that some remain single &#8220;for the sake of the kingdom of heaven&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/19-12.htm">Matthew 19:12</a>), yet most believers will marry. So Paul is not dismissing marriage; he is simply highlighting a change in practical focus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The married man</b><p>Here&#8217;s the man who has entered a covenant instituted by God from the very beginning&#8212;&#8220;For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). Marriage is honorable (<a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>), compares to Christ and the church (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31&#8211;32</a>), and is God&#8217;s good gift (<a href="/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>). Still, with that gift comes stewardship: the husband now bears responsibility not only for himself but also for his spouse.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is concerned</b><p>The phrase signals ongoing attention.<p>&#8226; This is not worry born of unbelief, but legitimate care&#8212;&#8220;If anyone does not provide for his own... he has denied the faith&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul uses the same word when he praises Timothy, who &#8220;will show genuine concern for your welfare&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20</a>).<p>&#8226; God assigns these earthly duties; they are part of loving one&#8217;s neighbor, beginning at home.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>about the affairs of this world</b><p>The expression points to everyday, earthly matters&#8212;food on the table, a roof overhead, safety, schooling, medical needs.

A married believer remains devoted to Christ, yet his daily schedule now includes meeting his wife&#8217;s needs and managing household affairs. These concerns are honorable and God-ordained, but they inevitably divide attention that could otherwise be singularly devoted to ministry. Paul&#8217;s point is not to discourage marriage; it is to help each believer weigh God&#8217;s calling honestly, recognizing both the blessings and the practical obligations that come with the covenant of marriage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Careth for the things that are of the world.</span> St. Paul's language must not be extravagantly pressed. It only applies absolutely to times in which the conditions are the same as they then were. The "anxious cares" which marriage involves may be more innocent and less distracting than those which attack the celibate condition; and when that is the case, marriage, on St. Paul's own principle, becomes a duty. Thus some of the best and greatest of our missionaries have found their usefulness as God's messengers vastly increased by marriage, in spite of the awful trials which marriage often involves. The apostles and brethren of the Lord felt the same. St. Paul's opinions here are, as he tells us, <span class="accented">opinions only</span>, and admit of many modifications. Advice given to men and women when Christians believed that the Lord was coming, perhaps in that very age, to judge the world, is not universally applicable to all ages. In St. Paul's later Epistles he does not revert to this advice, but assumes that marriage is the normal condition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/7-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
