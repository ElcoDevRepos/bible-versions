The term "worldly" suggests a focus on earthly desires and behaviors rather than spiritual growth. In the Greco-Roman culture, Corinth was known for its moral laxity and indulgence, which may have influenced the church. This worldly behavior contrasts with the call to be transformed by the renewing of the mind (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>). The church's failure to mature spiritually reflects a broader biblical theme of the struggle between the flesh and the spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a>).<p><b>For since there is jealousy and dissension among you,</b><br>Jealousy and dissension are manifestations of the flesh, as listed in <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>. These issues were prevalent in Corinth, a city marked by competition and social stratification. The church's internal conflicts mirror the divisions in the broader society, indicating a lack of unity that Paul frequently addresses (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>). Such behavior undermines the witness of the church and contradicts the unity that should characterize the body of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>).<p><b>are you not worldly?</b><br>Paul reiterates the charge of worldliness, emphasizing the seriousness of their condition. This rhetorical question serves to provoke self-examination among the Corinthians. The repetition underscores the incompatibility of their behavior with their identity in Christ. The call to holiness and separation from worldly influences is a consistent biblical theme (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>), urging believers to live in a manner worthy of their calling (<a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>).<p><b>Are you not walking in the way of man?</b><br>"Walking in the way of man" implies living according to human wisdom and standards rather than divine guidance. This phrase echoes the biblical contrast between the wisdom of the world and the wisdom of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20-25</a>). The Corinthians' reliance on human leaders and philosophies reflects a failure to grasp the spiritual truths Paul has been teaching. This behavior is reminiscent of Israel's history, where reliance on human strength often led to spiritual downfall (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>). The call is to walk by the Spirit, not by the flesh (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the church in Corinth with authority and pastoral concern.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and spiritually gifted congregation struggling with divisions and immaturity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jealousy_and_dissension.htm">Jealousy and Dissension</a></b><br>Specific issues within the Corinthian church that Paul identifies as evidence of their worldliness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/worldliness.htm">Worldliness</a></b><br>A state of being influenced by secular values and behaviors rather than spiritual maturity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_way_of_man.htm">The Way of Man</a></b><br>A reference to living according to human standards and desires rather than God's will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_worldliness.htm">Recognizing Worldliness</a></b><br>Evaluate areas in your life where worldly attitudes may be influencing your behavior and relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pursuing_spiritual_maturity.htm">Pursuing Spiritual Maturity</a></b><br>Commit to growing in spiritual maturity by studying Scripture, prayer, and fellowship with mature believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultivating_unity.htm">Cultivating Unity</a></b><br>Actively work towards unity within your church community by addressing conflicts and promoting peace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_jealousy.htm">Guarding Against Jealousy</a></b><br>Identify and confess any jealousy in your heart, seeking contentment and gratitude for God's blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/walking_in_the_spirit.htm">Walking in the Spirit</a></b><br>Strive to live according to the Spirit, allowing God's Word to guide your actions and decisions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_3_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 3:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_3_3_on_spiritual_immaturity_today.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 3:3 define spiritual immaturity and its manifestations today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_causes_jealousy_among_believers.htm">What causes "jealousy and dissension" among believers, according to 1 Corinthians 3:3?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_transcend_daily_human_behavior.htm">How can we overcome "acting like mere men" in our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Scriptures_on_church_jealousy_strife.htm">What other Scriptures address jealousy and strife within the church community?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Cultivate_spiritual_maturity_to_unite.htm">How can we cultivate spiritual maturity to avoid divisions in our church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_3_3_s_view_on_spiritual_immaturity.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 3:3 define spiritual immaturity among believers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_highlight_jealousy_in_1_Cor_3_3.htm">Why does Paul emphasize jealousy and strife in 1 Corinthians 3:3?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_shaped_Paul_s_message_in_1_Cor_3_3.htm">What historical context influenced Paul's message in 1 Corinthians 3:3?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_corinthians_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Corinthians 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_christian_weapons.htm">What are Christian Weapons?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'the_lord_is_my_rock'_mean.htm">Is envy the decay of one's inner self?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_envy_the_decay_of_one's_inner_self.htm">Is envy the decay of one's inner self?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_works_of_the_flesh.htm">What are the works of the flesh?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 1 Corinthians 3:3 Mean</div><b>You are still worldly</b><p>Paul&#8217;s opening words expose the Corinthians&#8217; spiritual condition. Though they belong to Christ, they are operating from the flesh rather than the Spirit. Scripture presents only two spheres: flesh versus Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-17</a>; <a href="/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5-8</a>). Whenever believers choose the flesh, progress stalls. Paul is not condemning their salvation; he is confronting their maturity level, much like the author of Hebrews who says, &#8220;You need milk, not solid food&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12-13</a>).<p>Key takeaways<p>&#8226; Worldliness shows up when saved people rely on human wisdom or natural impulses.<p>&#8226; Spiritual growth demands continual yielding to the Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Remaining &#8220;worldly&#8221; contradicts our new identity in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Since there is jealousy and strife among you</b><p>Paul points to jealousy and strife as proof of carnality. These attitudes fracture fellowship, grieving the Spirit who produces love and unity (<a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30-32</a>). James warns that &#8220;where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder&#8221; (<a href="/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>). When competition replaces cooperation, Christ&#8217;s body suffers (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-25.htm">1 Corinthians 12:25-26</a>).<p>Practical markers of jealousy and strife<p>&#8226; Comparing gifts or leaders (see <a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Resenting another&#8217;s influence or blessings (<a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5-8</a> illustrates jealousy&#8217;s deadly trajectory).<p>&#8226; Forming cliques that elevate preference over truth (3 <a href="/bsb/john/9.htm">John 9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are you not worldly?</b><p>Paul repeats the charge to jolt them awake. Measured by Scripture&#8212;not culture&#8212;jealousy and strife are unmistakable signs of fleshly thinking. Jesus said, &#8220;A tree is known by its fruit&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-33.htm">Matthew 12:33</a>). The fruit of the Spirit is peace; the works of the flesh include &#8220;jealousy, outbursts of anger, dissensions&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>). The standard remains unchanged: if the fruit is fleshly, the root is fleshly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are you not walking in the way of man?</b><p>&#8220;Walking&#8221; is daily lifestyle (<a href="/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>). To walk &#8220;in the way of man&#8221; is to imitate unbelievers rather than Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17-20</a>). God calls His children to a distinct walk&#8212;worthy of the calling they have received (<a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>). When our conduct blends in with the world, our witness dims (<a href="/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14-16</a>). The remedy is fixing our eyes on Jesus, letting His Word renew our minds (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p>Practical steps toward a Spirit-filled walk<p>&#8226; Confess fleshly attitudes immediately (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Cultivate gratitude; jealousy cannot coexist with thankfulness (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Pursue unity through humble service (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Stay saturated in Scripture; the Spirit uses the Word to transform us (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a> exposes a contrast: believers saved by grace yet behaving like the surrounding culture. Jealousy and strife reveal a worldly walk, but the Spirit offers power for mature, unified living.
