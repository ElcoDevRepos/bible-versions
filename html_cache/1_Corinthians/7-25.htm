The cultural context of Corinth, a city known for its immorality, highlights the importance of addressing issues of marriage and celibacy. The term "virgins" also reflects the early Christian emphasis on purity and the value placed on celibacy as a means of dedicating oneself fully to the Lord's work.<p><b>I have no command from the Lord</b><br>Paul acknowledges that he does not have a direct command from Jesus regarding the issue of virgins. This is significant because it shows Paul's humility and honesty in distinguishing between the teachings of Jesus and his own apostolic guidance. It also reflects the early church's reliance on apostolic authority to address new situations not explicitly covered by Jesus' teachings.<p><b>but I give a judgment</b><br>Paul offers his personal judgment, which is informed by his understanding of the gospel and his experience as an apostle. This judgment is not a command but a wise counsel, reflecting the flexibility and adaptability of early Christian teaching to address diverse circumstances. It underscores the role of spiritual discernment in making decisions that align with Christian values.<p><b>as one who by the Lord&#8217;s mercy is trustworthy</b><br>Paul emphasizes that his judgment is trustworthy because it is given by someone who has received mercy from the Lord. This highlights the transformative power of God's grace in Paul's life, from a persecutor of Christians to a leading apostle. It also reassures the Corinthians that his advice is reliable, rooted in his deep relationship with Christ and his commitment to the church's well-being.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, providing guidance on various issues, including marriage and singleness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled early Christian community in the city of Corinth, known for its moral and spiritual challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/virgins.htm">Virgins</a></b><br>In this context, "virgins" refers to unmarried individuals, particularly women, who are considering marriage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_mercy.htm">The Lord's Mercy</a></b><br>Paul acknowledges that his guidance is given under the mercy and trustworthiness granted to him by the Lord, emphasizing his role as a faithful servant.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>Paul distinguishes between direct commands from the Lord and his own apostolic advice, which is informed by his understanding and experience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trustworthy_guidance.htm">Trustworthy Guidance</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s advice, though not a direct command from the Lord, is given with the authority of a trustworthy apostle.

Paul simply notes Christ gave no specific teaching on this subject during His earthly ministry (compare <a href="/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>).<p>&#8226; By acknowledging what Jesus did and did not explicitly command, Paul upholds the authority of Christ&#8217;s words while preparing to apply God-given wisdom to a new situation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but I give a judgment</b><p>Paul proceeds to render Spirit-guided counsel (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-6.htm">1 Corinthians 7:6</a>, &#8220;I say this as a concession, not as a command&#8221;).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Judgment&#8221; here means a reliable, apostolic ruling&#8212;similar to the discernment exercised by the Jerusalem council in <a href="/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a>.<p>&#8226; The Church needs such judgments when explicit commands are absent; they provide practical guidance while honoring Scripture&#8217;s principles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as one who by the Lord&#8217;s mercy</b><p>Paul credits God&#8217;s mercy for his ability to speak on the matter (<a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a>, &#8220;I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Mercy underscores dependence on divine grace, not personal brilliance.<p>&#8226; The phrase matches his earlier admission: &#8220;By the grace of God I am what I am&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Every pastoral word must flow from the mercy first shown to the speaker.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is trustworthy</b><p>Because of Christ&#8217;s mercy, Paul&#8217;s counsel is reliable (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>, &#8220;it is required of stewards that they be found faithful&#8221;).<p>&#8226; His faithfulness has been proven through suffering and service (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>).<p>&#8226; The Spirit inspired Paul&#8217;s writings (<a href="/2_peter/3-15.htm">2 Peter 3:15-16</a>), so believers can accept this judgment with confidence equal to any biblical instruction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/7-25.htm">1 Corinthians 7:25</a> shows Paul addressing a new question&#8212;whether the never-married should wed&#8212;without a direct quote from Jesus. He humbly admits the Lord gave no specific command but, under inspiration and empowered by mercy, delivers a trustworthy apostolic ruling. The verse models how Christ&#8217;s servants handle areas where Scripture records no explicit word from Jesus: they rely on grace, speak faithfully, and provide guidance consistent with the whole counsel of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Wow concerning virgins . . .</span>--A new subject is here introduced--viz., the duty of parents regarding their young unmarried daughters.

The answer occupies to <a href="/1_corinthians/7-38.htm" title="So then he that gives her in marriage does well; but he that gives her not in marriage does better.">1Corinthians 7:38</a>. On this subject the Apostle states that he has no actual command from Christ. It was a point to which our Lord had not directly alluded in His teaching, and so the Apostle gives his opinion as one who has obtained mercy to be a faithful instructor. The contrast here is not between Paul inspired by the Lord and Paul not inspired, but, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12</a>, between Paul quoting the words of Christ and Paul himself instructing as an inspired Apostle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-40.</span> - <span class="accented">Advice respecting the unmarried.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now concerning virgins.</span> This is doubtless another reference to questions contained in the letter from Corinth. <span class="cmt_word">No commandment of the Lord</span>.
