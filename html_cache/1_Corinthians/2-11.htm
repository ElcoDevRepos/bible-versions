In biblical context, it underscores the idea that only an individual's spirit can truly understand their own thoughts and intentions. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of the heart's hidden nature, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which speaks of the heart being deceitful and beyond understanding. The phrase also reflects the ancient understanding of the spirit as the innermost part of a person, a concept prevalent in both Hebrew and Greco-Roman thought. This introspective view emphasizes the limitations of human understanding and the privacy of personal thoughts, which only the individual can fully comprehend.<p><b>So too, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</b><br>This part of the verse draws a parallel between human self-awareness and divine knowledge. Just as a person's spirit knows their thoughts, only the Spirit of God comprehends the divine mind. This highlights the transcendence and mystery of God, a theme consistent throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are described as higher than human understanding. The Spirit of God is presented as the exclusive means of accessing divine wisdom, emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in revelation and understanding. This concept is foundational to the Christian belief in the Trinity, where the Holy Spirit is seen as fully God, possessing complete knowledge of the divine will and purpose. This understanding is crucial for interpreting spiritual truths and aligns with the New Testament's emphasis on the Spirit's role in guiding believers into all truth, as seen in <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, a city known for its diversity and moral challenges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A Christian community in a cosmopolitan city, dealing with issues of division, immorality, and spiritual immaturity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_god.htm">The Spirit of God</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit, who reveals the thoughts and wisdom of God to believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/human_spirit.htm">Human Spirit</a></b><br>The inner part of a person that understands personal thoughts and intentions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and moral complexity, providing a backdrop for the challenges faced by the early church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_wisdom.htm">Understanding Divine Wisdom</a></b><br>The Spirit of God is essential for understanding God's thoughts and wisdom.

We alone are fully aware of our private thoughts; even those closest to us can only guess until we choose to reveal them (<a href="/proverbs/14-10.htm">Proverbs 14:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-13.htm">1 Samuel 1:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture underscores that the inner life is hidden from human view. <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9&#8211;10</a> reminds us the heart is deceitful, known perfectly only by the LORD; <a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a> shows God&#8217;s unique ability to &#8220;discern my thoughts from afar,&#8221; something no other person can do.<p>&#8226; By saying &#8220;his own spirit,&#8221; Paul affirms that a real, immaterial part of man exists&#8212;our spirit&#8212;distinct from the body (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>). That spirit forms the deepest level of self-awareness, making each person the most accurate witness of his or her motives and intentions (<a href="/1_john/3-20.htm">1 John 3:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Takeaway: if human privacy is this impenetrable, it sets the stage for understanding the far greater gap between our minds and God&#8217;s.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So too, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</b><p>&#8226; The parallel is deliberate: just as only your spirit knows your mind, only the Holy Spirit knows God&#8217;s mind. There is no created being&#8212;even the highest angel&#8212;who can probe God&#8217;s thoughts unaided (<a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; This declares the Spirit&#8217;s full deity. Because He comprehends &#8220;the depths of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>), He must share the same divine nature, not merely observe from outside (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical implications:<p>&#8211; Revelation is a gift. Everything we truly know about God comes because His Spirit has chosen to disclose it (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>&#8211; Dependence on the Spirit is essential for understanding Scripture. The natural mind, however brilliant, cannot grasp God&#8217;s wisdom without the Spirit&#8217;s illumination (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8211; Assurance flows from this truth. The Spirit who dwells in believers is the very One who knows God&#8217;s thoughts, so His guidance is trustworthy (<a href="/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s illustration roots divine revelation in everyday experience: if our own thoughts are hidden until our spirit makes them known, how much more are God&#8217;s thoughts hidden apart from His Spirit. Only the Holy Spirit, fully God Himself, can search, understand, and then communicate those thoughts to us. Therefore, confidence in Scripture and discernment in life hinge on listening to, relying on, and submitting to the Spirit who alone bridges the gap between the finite human mind and the infinite mind of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">What man . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Who of men knoweth the things of a man? but the spirit of the man which is in him knoweth them.</span><p><span class= "bld">The things of God knoweth no man.</span>--These words cannot be taken as an assertion that man cannot have any knowledge of the things of God; but the Apostle urges that man, as man, cannot know the things of God, but that his knowledge of these things is in virtue of his having the Spirit of God dwelling in him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The things of God none knoweth.</span> Some manuscripts have not the same word (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) as that rendered "knoweth" in the earlier clause, but "hath learnt" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); comp. <a href="/john/21-17.htm">John 21:17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-16.htm">2 Corinthians 5:16</a>.
