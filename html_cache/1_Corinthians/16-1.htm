The "saints" here are the Christian believers in Jerusalem who were experiencing severe economic hardship, possibly due to famine or persecution. This collection is a demonstration of the unity and mutual support within the early Church, transcending geographical and cultural boundaries. It reflects the principle of Christian charity and the responsibility of believers to care for one another, as seen in <a href="/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29-30</a>, where the disciples in Antioch send relief to the brothers living in Judea.<p><b>you are to do as I directed the churches of Galatia</b><br>Paul's instruction to the Corinthians to follow the same directive given to the Galatian churches indicates a standardized approach to this collection across different regions. The churches of Galatia were located in the Roman province of Galatia, which is in modern-day Turkey. This suggests that Paul had established a consistent method for collecting and managing these funds, ensuring accountability and transparency. It also highlights the apostolic authority Paul held over the churches he founded, as well as the interconnectedness of the early Christian communities. This directive aligns with the broader biblical principle of orderly and systematic giving, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where Paul emphasizes that each person should give what they have decided in their heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, providing guidance to the Corinthian church regarding the collection for the saints.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and dynamic early Christian community in the city of Corinth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_churches_of_galatia.htm">The Churches of Galatia</a></b><br>Other early Christian communities that Paul had previously instructed regarding the collection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_saints.htm">The Saints</a></b><br>Refers to the believers in Jerusalem who were in need, likely due to poverty or persecution.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_collection.htm">The Collection</a></b><br>A financial offering being organized by Paul to support the needy believers in Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_generosity.htm">Principle of Generosity</a></b><br>The early church exemplified a spirit of generosity, emphasizing the importance of supporting fellow believers in need.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_body_of_christ.htm">Unity in the Body of Christ</a></b><br>The collection for the saints demonstrates the interconnectedness of the early Christian communities, reminding us of our responsibility to care for one another.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/following_apostolic_instruction.htm">Following Apostolic Instruction</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s directive to the Corinthians, as he did with the Galatians, underscores the importance of adhering to apostolic teaching and guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_stewardship.htm">Practical Stewardship</a></b><br>The organization of the collection reflects the need for practical stewardship and planning in the administration of church resources.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The act of giving is a tangible expression of faith and love, serving as a witness to the transformative power of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_16_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 16:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_16_1_s_role_in_church_collections.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 16:1 guide us in organizing church collections today?

The subject weighed much on St. Paul's mind. First, there was real need for their charity, for at Jerusalem there was as sharp a contrast between the lots of the rich and poor as there is in London, and the "poor saints," being the poorest of the poor (<a href="/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a>), must have often been in deep distress. Not many years before this time, in the famine of Claudius, (<a href="/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27-30</a>), Queen Helena of Adiabene had kept the paupers of Jerusalem alive by importing cargoes of dried grapes and figs. Besides the periodical famines, the political troubles of Judaea had recently increased the general distress. Secondly, the tender heart of St. Paul was keenly alive to this distress. Thirdly, it was the only way in which the Gentile Churches could show their gratitude to the mother Church. Lastly, the Apostle St. Paul had solemnly promised the apostles at Jerusalem that he would remember the poor (<a href="/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>). Hence he frequently alludes to this collection (<a href="/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8, 9</a> <a href="/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="/acts/24-17.htm">Acts 24:17</a>, etc.). The enthusiastic communism of the earliest Christian society in Jerusalem had soon ceased, being, as all experience proves, an impossible experiment under the conditions which regulate all human life, and it may have aggravated the chronic distress. <span class="cmt_word">As I have given order;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as I arranged.<span class="cmt_word"></span> To the Churches of Galatia.</span> Not in his extant letter to the Galatians, but either in a visit three years before this time (<a href="/acts/18-28.htm">Acts 18:28</a>), or by letter. It appears from <a href="/2_corinthians/8-10.htm">2 Corinthians 8:10</a> that St. Paul had already asked for the contributions of the Corinthians. "To the Corinthians he proposes the example of the Galatians; to the Macedonians the example of the Corinthians; to the Romans that of the Macedonians and Corinthians.
