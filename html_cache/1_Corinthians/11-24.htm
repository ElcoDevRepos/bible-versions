Jesus, as a devout Jew, follows this custom, emphasizing gratitude to God. This act of thanksgiving is significant as it sets the tone for the sacredness of the moment. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of gratitude, seen in passages like <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>, where believers are encouraged to present their requests to God with thanksgiving.<p><b>He broke it</b><br>The breaking of the bread symbolizes the impending sacrifice of Jesus' body on the cross. In Jewish tradition, breaking bread was a common practice during meals, but here it takes on a deeper meaning. This act prefigures the physical breaking of Jesus' body during His crucifixion. The breaking of bread is also a communal act, signifying unity and fellowship among believers, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>, where the early church is described as devoted to the breaking of bread.<p><b>and said, &#8220;This is My body,</b><br>This statement is a profound declaration of Jesus' identification of the bread with His own body. It introduces the concept of the Eucharist or Communion, a central sacrament in Christian worship. The phrase echoes the language of sacrifice found in the Old Testament, where the body of the sacrificial lamb was offered for atonement. Jesus is presenting Himself as the ultimate Passover Lamb, fulfilling the prophecy and typology seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant.<p><b>which is for you;</b><br>This phrase underscores the substitutionary nature of Jesus' sacrifice. His body is given "for you," indicating that His death is on behalf of humanity. This concept is central to the doctrine of atonement, where Jesus takes the place of sinners, bearing the punishment they deserve. It reflects the love and selflessness of Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>, where Jesus speaks of laying down one's life for friends.<p><b>do this in remembrance of Me.&#8221;</b><br>Here, Jesus institutes a memorial act for His followers, instructing them to remember His sacrifice through the breaking of bread. This command establishes the practice of Communion as a perpetual ordinance in the church. The act of remembrance is not merely a mental exercise but a spiritual participation in the benefits of Christ's death. It connects believers to the past event of the crucifixion and its ongoing significance, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>, which speaks of drawing near to God through the new and living way opened by Jesus' sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who institutes the Lord's Supper during the Last Supper with His disciples.

The former were probably inserted so as to produce a verbal identity with St. Matthew's account, and the word "broken" possibly as explanatory. At the institution the act of breaking the bread explained sufficiently what was meant. The Master, while in the act of breaking it, said, "This is My body, which is for you."<p><span class= "bld">This do in remembrance of me</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> all that was done then.

If the soft music of those words could reach us now, disentangled from the theological discords of intervening ages, surely they would come to us with some such significance. To those who first heard them they certainly must have implied not that a physical presence was about to be perpetuated, but rather that there was now something for them which would in after ages console them for a physical absence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he had given thanks.</span> The same word is used in St. Luke <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), and is the origin of the name Eucharist. St. Mark and perhaps St. Matthew have "having blessed it" (<span class="accented">eulogesas</span>). Hence the Eucharist is "this our sacrifice of <span class="accented">praise</span> and thanksgiving." <span class="cmt_word">Take, eat.</span> These words are omitted by all the best uncials, <span class="cmt_word">Which is broken for you.</span> The word "broken" is of doubtful authenticity. Some manuscripts have "given," and one (D) a milder word for "broken," as though to avoid any contradiction of <a href="/john/19-36.htm">John 19:36</a>, where, however, the word is "shall not be <span class="accented">crushed."</span> Since the participle is omitted altogether by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, there can be no doubt that it is a gloss, and accordingly the Revised Version reads, "which is for you." The "broken" is nevertheless involved in the "he brake it," which was a part of the ceremony as originally illustrated. The breaking of the bread ought not, therefore, to be abandoned, as in the case when "wafers" are used. <span class="cmt_word">This do.</span> St. Luke also has this clause, which is not found in St. Matthew or St. Mark. The variations show that it was the <span class="accented">main fact</span> which was essential, not the exact words spoken. <span class="cmt_word">In remembrance of me.</span> The words may also be rendered, <span class="accented">for a memorial of me</span>, or <span class="accented">to bring me to your remembrance.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">when He had given thanks,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eucharist&#275;sas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2168.htm">Strong's 2168: </a> </span><span class="str2">From eucharistos; to be grateful, i.e. to express gratitude; specially, to say grace at a meal.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He broke [it]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#954;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eklasen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2806.htm">Strong's 2806: </a> </span><span class="str2">To break (in pieces), break bread.
