His household likely included family members and possibly servants, all of whom embraced Christianity. This reflects the early church's growth through household conversions, a common occurrence in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15, 31</a>-34). The mention of a household conversion underscores the communal nature of early Christian faith and the influence of a household leader in spiritual matters.<p><b>were the first converts in Achaia</b><br>Achaia was a Roman province in southern Greece, with Corinth as its capital. Being the first converts in this region highlights the pioneering role of Stephanas and his household in spreading Christianity. This aligns with Paul's mission strategy of establishing a foothold in key urban centers (<a href="/acts/18.htm">Acts 18:1-11</a>). Their conversion marks the beginning of the church's expansion in a predominantly pagan area, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints</b><br>The term "devoted" indicates a committed and ongoing effort to support fellow believers. This service likely included hospitality, financial support, and leadership within the church. Such dedication exemplifies the Christian call to serve one another in love (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>). The "saints" refers to all believers, emphasizing the unity and mutual care within the body of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12</a>).<p><b>Now I urge you, brothers</b><br>Paul's appeal to the Corinthian believers as "brothers" underscores the familial relationship among Christians. This term reflects the close-knit community and mutual responsibility within the church. Paul's urging suggests the importance of following the example set by Stephanas and his household, encouraging the Corinthians to emulate their dedication and service (<a href="/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephanas.htm">Stephanas</a></b><br>A prominent member of the Corinthian church, recognized for his early conversion and dedication to serving the Christian community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/household_of_stephanas.htm">Household of Stephanas</a></b><br>This group includes family members and possibly servants who were also early converts and shared in the ministry work.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/achaia.htm">Achaia</a></b><br>A region in Greece where Corinth is located, significant as a center of early Christian evangelism and church planting.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/service_to_the_saints.htm">Service to the Saints</a></b><br>Refers to the ministry and support provided to fellow believers, emphasizing hospitality, teaching, and other acts of service.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/first_converts.htm">First Converts</a></b><br>Indicates the pioneering role of Stephanas and his household in the spread of Christianity in Achaia.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_first_converts.htm">The Importance of First Converts</a></b><br>Early believers like Stephanas play a crucial role in establishing and nurturing new Christian communities.

There is in the original a characteristic play upon words here which can scarcely be rendered adequately in the English: "Ye know the house of Stephanas, that they have <span class= "ital">ordered themselves</span> to the ministry of the saints, now I exhort you, <span class= "ital">order yourselves</span> to be subject to them." Stephanas (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1-16</a>), Fortunatus, and Achaicus had come from Corinth to Ephesus, probably with the letter from the Corinthians (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1Corinthians 8:1</a>), and their presence had cheered the Apostle. They, "faithful amid the faithless," had made up for the want of zeal and love on the part of so many of the Corinthians. The Corinthians might think that these men had told St. Paul much of the evil state of Corinth, and he, therefore, carefully commends them to their consideration as having refreshed, not only his spirit, but "theirs also." They had come on behalf of the whole Church there, not enemies to bear tales, but well-wishing friends to obtain apostolic help and counsel for all. The Apostle did not send his reply back by the same messengers, but by Titus instead, as probably their return to Corinth would have stirred up a good deal of controversy and ill feeling as to what account they had given him verbally of the various parties and their conduct in Corinth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye know the house of Stephanas.</span> This paragraph seems to have been written lest the Corinthians should be angry with Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus - who, perhaps, were slaves of the household of Chloe - for having carried to St. Paul their ill report (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-11.htm">1 Corinthians 1:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The firstfruits of Achaia.</span> For which reason St. Paul had baptized Stephanas and his house (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-16.htm">1 Corinthians 1:16</a>).
