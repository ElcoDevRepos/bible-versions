In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul addresses a community living in a bustling, cosmopolitan city known for its commerce and wealth. The "things of this world" can refer to material possessions, social status, and daily activities. Biblically, this echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where He advises storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth. The use of worldly things is not condemned, but believers are reminded to maintain a proper perspective.<p><b>as if not dependent on them.</b><br>Here, Paul emphasizes the transient nature of worldly possessions and the importance of not becoming overly attached. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where believers are caretakers of God's creation rather than owners. The idea is to use resources wisely without letting them control one's life. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>, warning against greed and the belief that life consists of an abundance of possessions. The call is to live with an eternal perspective, focusing on spiritual growth and reliance on God.<p><b>For this world in its present form is passing away.</b><br>Paul reminds the Corinthians of the temporary nature of the current world order. This eschatological perspective is consistent with other New Testament teachings, such as 1 <a href="/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>, which states that the world and its desires are passing away. The phrase underscores the urgency of living for God's kingdom, which is eternal. Historically, this reflects the early Christian belief in the imminent return of Christ and the establishment of a new heaven and earth, as prophesied in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>. The transient nature of the world encourages believers to prioritize their relationship with God and the pursuit of eternal values.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on Christian living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and moral challenges, where the early Christian church faced various issues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, dealing with questions about marriage, singleness, and worldly concerns.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_present_world.htm">The Present World</a></b><br>Refers to the current age or system, which Paul describes as temporary and transient.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>Implied as the eternal reality that contrasts with the temporary nature of the present world.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_the_world.htm">The Transience of the World</a></b><br>Recognize that the current world system is temporary.
