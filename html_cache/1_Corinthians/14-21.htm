Here, Paul is likely referring to <a href="/isaiah/28-11.htm">Isaiah 28:11-12</a>, where God speaks of using foreign languages as a sign of judgment against Israel. The "Law" in this context can refer broadly to the Hebrew Scriptures, including the Prophets. This highlights the continuity between the Old and New Testaments and underscores the authority of Scripture in Paul's argument.<p><b>By strange tongues and foreign lips:</b><br>The mention of "strange tongues and foreign lips" alludes to the Assyrian invasion of Israel, where the Assyrians spoke a language unfamiliar to the Israelites. This serves as a historical example of God using foreign nations to execute judgment. In the New Testament context, it connects to the gift of tongues, which was a sign to unbelievers, particularly to the Jewish people who were familiar with the prophecy. The use of foreign languages was a divine tool to capture attention and convey a message of both warning and opportunity for repentance.<p><b>I will speak to this people:</b><br>"This people" refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who were often resistant to His messages delivered through prophets. The phrase emphasizes God's direct involvement in communicating with His people, despite their disobedience. It also reflects God's persistent desire to reach out to His people, even when they are unresponsive. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who also came to speak to God's people, often facing rejection.<p><b>But even then they will not listen to Me:</b><br>This highlights the stubbornness and hard-heartedness of the people, a recurring theme throughout the Bible. Despite clear signs and messages, the Israelites often failed to heed God's warnings. This serves as a warning to the Corinthian church and to all believers about the dangers of ignoring God's voice. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of human rebellion and the need for divine intervention through Christ.<p><b>Says the Lord:</b><br>This phrase asserts the authority and finality of the message. It is a reminder that the words spoken are not merely human opinions but are declarations from God Himself. This underscores the seriousness of the message and the certainty of its fulfillment. It also connects to the prophetic tradition, where messages are often concluded with a divine affirmation, reinforcing the truth and reliability of God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth about the use of spiritual gifts, particularly the gift of tongues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and spiritually gifted congregation facing issues of disorder and misunderstanding regarding spiritual gifts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah_the_prophet.htm">Isaiah the Prophet</a></b><br>The original source of the quote Paul uses, found in <a href="/isaiah/28-11.htm">Isaiah 28:11-12</a>, where God speaks to Israel through foreign tongues as a sign of judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament scriptures, particularly the prophetic writings, which Paul cites to make his point.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>God, who speaks through the prophets and through Paul, emphasizing His sovereignty and the importance of listening to His message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_gifts.htm">Understanding Spiritual Gifts</a></b><br>Recognize that spiritual gifts, like tongues, are meant for edification and as signs, not for personal glory or confusion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening_to_god.htm">The Importance of Listening to God</a></b><br>Just as Israel was judged for not listening, we must be attentive to God&#8217;s voice in our lives through His Word and Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophecy_and_tongues.htm">The Role of Prophecy and Tongues</a></b><br>Prophecy is for the edification of the church, while tongues serve as a sign, particularly to unbelievers, highlighting the need for order in worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_communication.htm">God&#8217;s Sovereignty in Communication</a></b><br>God chooses how to communicate with His people, and we must be open to His methods, whether through scripture, prophecy, or other means.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_mercy.htm">Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>God&#8217;s use of foreign tongues as a sign of judgment also points to His mercy, as it serves as a call to repentance and faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_14_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 14:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_14_21_s_link_to_today_s_spiritual_gifts.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 14:21 relate to the use of spiritual gifts today?

By doing so, he shows that the principles he is about to illustrate regarding tongues in the Corinthian assembly are not new but flow from God&#8217;s timeless Word (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). When believers gather, every practice&#8212;tongues included&#8212;must be measured by what is written, not by personal experience or novelty. Thus, the passage affirms both the sufficiency and the supremacy of Scripture in guiding worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By strange tongues and foreign lips</b><p>The phrase echoes <a href="/isaiah/28-11.htm">Isaiah 28:11&#8211;12</a>, where God warned rebellious Israel that foreign invaders would speak to them in languages they did not understand&#8212;a sign of coming judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>). In <a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4&#8211;12</a>, God again used unlearned languages to grab the attention of a diverse crowd in Jerusalem, signaling both the gospel&#8217;s outreach and, to unbelieving Jews, the seriousness of rejecting Christ. For Corinth, Paul&#8217;s point is clear: tongues are not spiritual showpieces; they are signposts that can indicate either blessing (when interpreted and believed) or impending judgment (when dismissed).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will speak to this people</b><p>The Lord&#8217;s persistence shines through. From the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>), through the prophets (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>), to His own Son (<a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>), God has always chosen to speak. Even when He turns to &#8220;foreign lips,&#8221; His aim is still redemptive&#8212;He desires repentance and faith (<a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>). In the Corinthian setting, the gift of tongues is another way God &#8220;speaks to this people,&#8221; offering truth in a supernatural packaging that should stir awe and reflection rather than pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But even then they will not listen to Me</b><p>Here is the tragedy. Despite clear, even miraculous communication, hardened hearts can remain unmoved (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/acts/28-26.htm">Acts 28:26&#8211;28</a>). Paul uses this sobering reality to caution the Corinthians: uninterpreted tongues may impress the speaker, yet they leave the hearer untouched, repeating ancient Israel&#8217;s refusal to listen. Therefore, prophecy&#8212;which conveys God&#8217;s message plainly&#8212;edifies the church, whereas uninterpreted tongues risk reinforcing unbelief (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Says the Lord</b><p>The final words underscore divine authority (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). What follows is not Paul&#8217;s preference but God&#8217;s pronouncement. In any discussion about spiritual gifts, His voice must carry the decisive weight. Submission to that voice leads to orderly, edifying worship (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33, 40</a>), avoiding the chaos that plagued Corinth and ensuring that God, not human excitement, remains central.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/14-21.htm">1 Corinthians 14:21</a> reveals that tongues are a scripturally grounded sign: God may use unfamiliar languages to warn, woo, or judge. Yet even supernatural speech cannot guarantee a receptive heart. Paul cites this verse to remind the Corinthians&#8212;and us&#8212;that every gift must serve understanding and obedience to God&#8217;s authoritative Word. When the church exalts proclamation that people grasp, and humbly submits to Scripture, it honors the Lord who still speaks and invites all to listen.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21, 22) <span class= "bld">In the law it is written.</span>--The preceding teaching is illustrated and enforced by an appeal to Jewish history. The Old Testament as a whole was not infrequently thus designated "the Law." (See <a href="/john/10-34.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?">John 10:34</a>; <a href="/john/12-34.htm" title="The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ stays for ever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?">John 12:34</a>; <a href="/john/15-25.htm" title="But this comes to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.">John 15:25</a>.) The words are scarcely a quotation, but rather an illustration taken from <a href="/context/isaiah/28-9.htm" title="Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.">Isaiah 28:9-12</a>. The passage there refers to the refusal of Israel to hearken to Jehovah when He spoke to them with clearness and simplicity, and His judgment on them taking the form of declaring that He would make a foreign people--the Assyrians--be His mouthpiece to them in the future, in a language which they knew not. It is as if the Apostle said: Remember there was a time in Jewish history when an unintelligible language was a sign sent by God, and proved unavailing as regards the conversion of Israel. The gift which you so exalt now is equally useless by itself for that same purpose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the Law.</span> The quotation is from <a href="/isaiah/28-11.htm">Isaiah 28:11, 12</a>, but the term "the Law" was applied generally to the Old Testament, as in <a href="/john/10-34.htm">John 10:34</a>; <a href="/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>; <a href="/john/15-25.htm">John 15:25</a>; <a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With men of other tongues,</span> etc. The application of this Old Testament quotation furnishes one of the many singular instances of quotation which prove that the Jews often referred to the <span class="accented">words</span> without any direct reference to their context or original meaning. He here wishes to show that glossolaly had little or no value except as an evidence to unbelievers, and illustrates this by <a href="/isaiah/28-11.htm">Isaiah 28:11, 12</a>. Now, in that passage Isaiah tells the drunken priests, who scornfully imitated his style, that, since they derided God's message so delivered to them, God would address them in a very different way by the Assyrians, whose language they did not understand; and that even to <span class="accented">this</span> stern lesson, taught them by people of alien tongue, they would remain deaf. In the original, therefore, there is not the least allusion to any phenomenon resembling the "gift of tongues." But the mere <span class="accented">words</span> of a scriptural passage always came to Jews with all the force of an argument, independently of their primary meaning; and it was enough for St. Paul's purpose that in Isaiah the allusion is to unintelligible utterance, and to the fact that the teaching which it was meant to convey would be in vain. And other lips. St. Paul does not quote the LXX.
