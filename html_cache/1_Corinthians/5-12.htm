In the Greco-Roman context, the church was a minority group with distinct beliefs and practices. Paul underscores that the church's primary responsibility is to maintain its own purity and integrity, rather than imposing its standards on those who do not share its faith. This reflects Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/7.htm">Matthew 7:1-5</a> about not judging others hypocritically. The church is called to be a light to the world (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>), but it is not tasked with judging those who are not part of the faith community.<p><b>Are you not to judge those inside?</b><br>Paul insists that the church has a responsibility to hold its members accountable to the standards of Christian conduct. This internal judgment is necessary for maintaining the holiness and witness of the church. In <a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-11</a>, Paul addresses a case of immorality within the church, urging the community to take corrective action. This reflects the principle of church discipline found in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>, where Jesus outlines steps for addressing sin among believers. The goal of such judgment is restoration and reconciliation, not condemnation, aligning with the redemptive work of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Corinthians, addressing issues within the church at Corinth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>A Christian community in Corinth, known for its diverse and often problematic behaviors, which Paul addresses in his letters.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_within_the_church.htm">Judgment within the Church</a></b><br>The context of this passage involves the responsibility of church members to hold each other accountable to Christian standards.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_judgment.htm">Understanding Judgment</a></b><br>Paul distinguishes between judging those inside the church and those outside.

The church is never commissioned to police the morality of the world; that task belongs to God alone (<a href="/romans/2-3.htm">Romans 2:3-5</a>; <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier in this chapter he clarified that believers are not to sever everyday contact with unbelievers, because &#8220;then you would have to leave the world&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-10.htm">1 Corinthians 5:10</a>). Instead, we engage them with the gospel (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) while remembering that only the Spirit can transform hearts (<a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; own earthly mission modeled this stance: &#8220;For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; When believers shift focus to judging outsiders, the church&#8217;s witness is blunted. Our energy is meant for proclaiming Christ, not moral policing (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15-16</a>).<p>Practical takeaway:<p>&#8211; Show genuine kindness to those who do not know Christ, recognizing that they need regeneration, not condemnation (<a href="/titus/3-3.htm">Titus 3:3-5</a>).<p>&#8211; Let civil authorities address societal wrongdoing (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-4</a>); the church keeps the gospel central.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are you not to judge those inside?</b><p>&#8220;Are you not to judge those inside?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-12.htm">1 Corinthians 5:12</a>)<p>&#8226; Paul insists that the local congregation has a God-given responsibility to evaluate and address blatant, unrepentant sin among its own members (<a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This &#8220;judging&#8221; is never harsh fault-finding but a loving, restorative discipline meant to protect the purity of Christ&#8217;s body (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>) and reclaim the sinner (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus laid out the process: approach privately, then with witnesses, then tell the church, and if necessary treat the person &#8220;as a pagan or a tax collector&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Other passages echo this call:<p>&#8211; &#8220;Keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;Those who persist in sin should be rebuked in the presence of everyone&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-20.htm">1 Timothy 5:20</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;If anyone does not obey our instruction&#8230; do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Such accountability guards the congregation from the spreading influence of sin&#8212;&#8220;a little leaven works through the whole batch of dough&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>).<p>Practically this means:<p>&#8211; Church leaders and members alike pursue holiness together (<a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>).<p>&#8211; Discipline is carried out with humility, aiming for repentance and restoration, never humiliation (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-6.htm">2 Corinthians 2:6-8</a>).<p>&#8211; The standard applied is God&#8217;s Word, not personal preferences (<a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s two rhetorical questions set boundaries for Christian judgment. We leave the judgment of unbelievers to God and concentrate on sharing Christ with them.
