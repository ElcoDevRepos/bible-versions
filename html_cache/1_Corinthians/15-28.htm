The concept of subjection is rooted in the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the ultimate restoration of order. This echoes <a href="/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>, where humanity's dominion over creation is a type of Christ's ultimate rule. The subjection of all things to Christ is also mentioned in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee bows and every tongue confesses His lordship. Historically, this reflects the Roman practice of subjugation, where conquered peoples acknowledged the authority of the emperor, symbolizing peace and order.<p><b>then the Son Himself will be made subject to Him who put all things under Him</b><br>This indicates a voluntary submission of the Son to the Father, emphasizing the unity and distinct roles within the Trinity. The Son's subjection is not about inferiority but about fulfilling the divine order and purpose. This reflects the cultural context of the first-century Greco-Roman world, where hierarchical structures were common, yet the relationship within the Godhead transcends human understanding. Theologically, this aligns with <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>, where Jesus speaks of doing only what He sees the Father doing, highlighting His obedience and unity with the Father.<p><b>so that God may be all in all</b><br>This phrase points to the ultimate goal of God's plan: the complete and perfect reign of God over all creation. It signifies the restoration of harmony and the fulfillment of God's kingdom. This is reminiscent of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>, where every knee bows to God, and <a href="/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>, where the Lord is king over the whole earth. Theologically, it reflects the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>, where God dwells with His people, and there is no more separation between God and humanity. This phrase encapsulates the biblical narrative of creation, fall, redemption, and restoration, culminating in God's eternal reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The ultimate authority to whom all things are subjected.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ (the Son)</a></b><br>The one who subjects Himself to the Father after all things are subjected to Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/all_things.htm">All Things</a></b><br>Refers to all creation and powers that are to be subjected to Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>The city where the church addressed by Paul is located, known for its diverse and often morally challenging environment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>God's ultimate authority is affirmed as all things are subjected to Him.

The attempts to explain them have usually been nothing but ingenious methods of explaining them away. Of these the one usually adopted by the Fathers is the limitation of the statement to Christ's human nature (<a href="/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26, 27, 30</a>) and mediatorial kingdom, just as we find in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>. The head of Christ is God." We can easily "darken counsel by words without knowledge" in dealing with this subject, and hide an absolute ignorance under a semblance of knowledge; but anything and everything which we can say in "explanation" of this self subjection of the Son to the Father is simply involved in the words which follow. <span class="cmt_word">That God may be all in all.</span> "All things in all things" or "all things in all men." The words involve a complete and absolute supremacy. It is quite an easy matter for commentators to say that the scope of the words "must be confined to believers," if they chose to make "all" mean "some." Such methods often lead to an irreligious religionism and a heterodox orthodoxy. The reader will find the same phrase in <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>. I confine myself to the comment of the profound and saintly Bengel: "There is implied something new, but also supreme and eternal. All things, and therefore all men, without any interruption, no created thing claiming a place, no enemy creating opposition, shall be subordinated to the Son, the Son to the Father. All things shall say, 'God is all things to me.' This is the consummation; this the end and summit. Further than this not even an apostle can go." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/15-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hotan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3752.htm">Strong's 3752: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, whenever.
