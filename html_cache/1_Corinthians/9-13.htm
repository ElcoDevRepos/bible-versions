In <a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-20</a>, God commands that the Levites receive a portion of the offerings as their inheritance, since they had no land of their own. This system ensured that those dedicated to spiritual service were supported by the community. The principle here is one of provision for those who dedicate their lives to ministry, reflecting a broader biblical theme of supporting God's workers, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-5</a>.<p><b>and those who serve at the altar partake of its offerings</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the specific role of the priests who performed sacrifices at the altar.

This practice underscores the idea of sharing in the sacred duties and the benefits that come with them. The altar, central to Israelite worship, symbolizes the place of atonement and communion with God. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to support those who preach the gospel, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17-18</a>.

The question is rhetorical, signaling that what follows is already established in Scripture. Paul expects believers to recall how God provided for His servants in the Old Covenant. <a href="/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1</a> shows the same pattern&#8212;appealing to what readers should already accept from the Law.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those who work in the temple</b><p>&#8226; The phrase points to the priests and Levites whose full-time vocation was temple service (<a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>; 2 Chron 31:4).<p>&#8226; Their tasks ranged from guarding holy things to leading worship and offering sacrifices.<p>&#8226; Because they were bound to this work, they did not farm land or engage in ordinary trades (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>).

The principle is not merely pragmatic; it is woven into Scripture from Moses to Paul, affirming both the sacredness of ministry and the responsibility of God&#8217;s people to sustain those who labor in it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Do ye not know.</span>--The Apostle now turns to appeal to an argument which would have weight with them as Christians. The rights of the ministry to be supported by the Church have already been established by an appeal to ordinary life and to the Jewish law; and the statement has been made that the Apostle having that right, did not, for wise reasons, use it. There is one higher step in the argument. It was not only a principle of Jewish law which Christ might have abrogated, but it was a provision of the Jewish economy which Christ Himself formally perpetuated.<p><span class= "bld">They which minister. . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">They which minister about the holy things eat from the temple, and they which serve at the altar have their share with the altar.</span> The first part of this passage refers to the general principle that the priests who were engaged in the Temple services were supported from the various offerings which were brought there, and the second clause more definitely alludes to the particular fact that when a sacrifice was offered on the altar, the sacrificing priests, as well as the altar, had a share of the animal. (See <a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm" title="And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.">Leviticus 6:16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-26.htm" title="The priest that offers it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 6:26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-6.htm" title="Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.">Leviticus 7:6</a>; Numbers 5; Numbers 18; Deuteronomy 10, 18) A suggestion that the allusion might be to the custom of the heathen priests is wholly inadmissible, for such would have no force for Christians, and would entirely destroy the sequence of the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They which minister about holy things.</span> Jewish priests.
