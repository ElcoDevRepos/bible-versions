The concept of being "bought" reflects the ancient practice of purchasing slaves or goods, highlighting the costliness of Christ's sacrifice. In the Greco-Roman world, slaves could be bought and sold, and this imagery would resonate with the Corinthian audience, many of whom were familiar with slavery. The "price" refers to the blood of Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>, which underscores the preciousness and value of the sacrifice. This echoes the Old Testament sacrificial system, where a price was paid for atonement, pointing to Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of these sacrifices.<p><b>do not become slaves of men.</b><br>This part of the verse warns against submitting to human authority or systems that contradict one's allegiance to Christ. In the historical context, Corinth was a city with a significant population of slaves, and the metaphor of slavery would be powerful. Paul is urging believers to recognize their primary identity and allegiance as belonging to Christ, not to any human master or societal expectation. This can also be seen as a call to spiritual freedom, as in <a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>, where believers are encouraged to stand firm in the freedom Christ provides. Theologically, it underscores the believer's liberation from sin and the law, as well as the call to live under the lordship of Christ rather than human dictates.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on Christian living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece known for its commerce and diverse population, including a significant Christian community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, dealing with issues of morality, division, and questions about Christian conduct.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The one who paid the price for believers' freedom through His sacrificial death.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/slavery_in_the_roman_empire.htm">Slavery in the Roman Empire</a></b><br>A common social institution during Paul's time, providing a backdrop for his metaphorical use of slavery.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_value.htm">Understanding Our Value</a></b><br>Recognize that believers are precious to God, having been purchased by the blood of Christ.

The moment we trusted Christ, we ceased to be our own possession.<p>- Scripture piles up proof: &#8220;You are not your own; you were bought at a price&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>). Peter echoes, &#8220;You were redeemed&#8230; with the precious blood of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>). <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a> adds that God &#8220;purchased&#8221; the church with His own blood.<p>- Because the purchase is complete, our past slavery to sin has ended (<a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>). We now belong to the Lord; He alone sets the agenda for our lives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At a price</b><p>- The price was immeasurable: the blood and life of Jesus. <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a> calls it &#8220;a ransom for many.&#8221;<p>- This cost reveals our value to God. <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a> says He showed His love while we were still sinners.<p>- It also underscores the seriousness of redemption. <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a> reminds us that in Christ &#8220;we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses.&#8221;<p>- Practical takeaway: gratitude becomes the driver of obedience. We serve not to earn favor but because immense favor has already been paid for us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not become slaves of men</b><p>- Paul&#8217;s warning is both social and spiritual. Even if a believer&#8217;s earthly status is one of literal servitude (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21</a>), no person may claim ultimate ownership of Christ&#8217;s disciple.<p>- Freedom in Christ means refusing any human authority&#8212;philosophies, peer pressure, legalism, or fear&#8212;that competes with His lordship. <a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a> urges, &#8220;Stand firm, then, and do not be encumbered once more by a yoke of slavery.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a> cautions against being &#8220;taken captive through philosophy and empty deception.&#8221; When human commands conflict with God&#8217;s will, <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a> sets the priority: &#8220;We must obey God rather than men.&#8221;<p>- Living this out may involve:<p>&#8226; Holding convictions even when culture disagrees.<p>&#8226; Serving employers and authorities respectfully (<a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-8</a>) while remembering they do not own us.<p>&#8226; Guarding against habits or addictions that would re-enslave the heart Christ freed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Christ paid the highest price&#8212;His own blood&#8212;to make us His treasured possession. Because we belong to Him, no human master, system, or expectation can rightly claim ownership of our conscience or devotion.
