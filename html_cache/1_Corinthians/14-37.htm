The term "prophet" refers to someone who speaks forth God's message, often with an element of foretelling. In the Corinthian context, spiritual gifts were abundant, and there was a tendency for individuals to assert their spiritual authority. This phrase challenges those who claim such roles to validate their authenticity by aligning with apostolic teaching. The emphasis on spiritual discernment echoes 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>, which advises believers to test the spirits to see whether they are from God.<p><b>let him acknowledge that what I am writing you is the Lord&#8217;s command</b><br>Paul asserts his apostolic authority, emphasizing that his instructions are not merely personal opinions but divinely inspired directives. This claim underscores the belief in the inspiration of Scripture, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>, which states that all Scripture is God-breathed. The phrase also reflects the early church's understanding of apostolic writings as authoritative, akin to the Old Testament Scriptures. By insisting on acknowledgment of his writings as the Lord's command, Paul reinforces the unity and order necessary for the church's edification, countering the chaos and division that plagued the

Spirit&#8217;s leading (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-15.htm">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet genuine spirituality is measured by submission to revealed truth (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>).<p>Paul invites self-examination: if you truly bear prophetic or spiritual credentials, prove it by aligning with apostolic teaching rather than personal impressions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>let him acknowledge</b><p>Acknowledgment is more than polite agreement; it is public recognition of authority.<p>&#8226; The Thessalonians were told, &#8220;Test all things; hold

Honest inquiry leads to humble acceptance when God&#8217;s Word is confirmed.<p>&#8226; By asking for acknowledgment, Paul demands accountability from every speaker in the assembly (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-29.htm">1 Corinthians 14:29-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that what I am writing you</b><p>Paul&#8217;s own pen carries weight equal to his spoken preaching.<p>&#8226; Peter later classifies Paul&#8217;s letters with &#8220;the other Scriptures&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-15.htm">2 Peter 3:15-16</a>), underscoring their inspired status.<p>&#8226; Earlier in this chapter Paul asked, &#8220;Did the word of God originate with you?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-36.htm">1 Corinthians 14:36</a>).
