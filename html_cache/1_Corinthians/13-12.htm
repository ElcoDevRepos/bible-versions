This imagery suggests that our current understanding of spiritual truths is incomplete and imperfect. The Apostle Paul uses this metaphor to illustrate the limitations of human knowledge and perception in this life. The concept of seeing "dimly" aligns with the broader biblical theme of partial revelation, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>, which speaks of walking by faith, not by sight. This phrase emphasizes the contrast between our present limited understanding and the complete clarity we will experience in the future.<p><b>then we shall see face to face.</b><br>This phrase points to a future time of perfect understanding and direct communion with God. The expression "face to face" is reminiscent of Moses' unique relationship with God, as described in <a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>, where the Lord spoke to Moses as one speaks to a friend. It signifies a time when believers will have an unmediated and intimate relationship with God, free from the limitations of earthly existence. This future hope is often associated with the eschatological fulfillment of God's promises, as seen in <a href="/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>, where believers will see God's face in the new creation.<p><b>Now I know in part;</b><br>Paul acknowledges the current state of partial knowledge, reflecting the limitations of human understanding in the present age. This partial knowledge is a result of living in a fallen world, where sin and human frailty obscure the full comprehension of divine truths. The acknowledgment of knowing "in part" is consistent with the humility that characterizes Paul's teachings, as he often emphasizes the need for reliance on God's wisdom rather than human understanding, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9-10</a>.<p><b>then I shall know fully,</b><br>The promise of full knowledge in the future is a source of hope for believers. This complete understanding will be granted in the eschatological fulfillment of God's plan, when believers are glorified and fully conformed to the image of Christ. The idea of knowing fully is connected to the transformative power of the resurrection, as described in <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>, where our lowly bodies will be transformed to be like Christ's glorious body. This future state of full knowledge is also linked to the perfect love and unity that will characterize the eternal kingdom of God.<p><b>even as I am fully known.</b><br>This phrase highlights the intimate and complete knowledge that God has of each individual. God's omniscience means that He knows us fully, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, where the psalmist marvels at God's thorough understanding of his thoughts and actions. The assurance that we will one day know God as fully as He knows us underscores the depth of the relationship that believers will enjoy with their Creator. This future state of mutual knowledge reflects the ultimate fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, where the barriers of sin and misunderstanding are removed, and believers experience the fullness of God's presence and love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, providing guidance on spiritual gifts and love.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and diversity, but also for moral and spiritual challenges within the church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, struggling with issues of division, immorality, and misunderstanding of spiritual gifts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_current_limitations.htm">Understanding Our Current Limitations</a></b><br>Recognize that our current understanding of God and spiritual truths is limited, like seeing a dim reflection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_for_future_clarity.htm">Hope for Future Clarity</a></b><br>Embrace the promise that one day we will see God face to face and understand fully, which should inspire hope and perseverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_love.htm">The Importance of Love</a></b><br>In the context of <a href="/bsb/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, love is the greatest gift and should be our focus, even as we await full understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pursuing_spiritual_growth.htm">Pursuing Spiritual Growth</a></b><br>Strive to grow in knowledge and love, knowing that our understanding will be made complete in the future.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_humility.htm">Living with Humility</a></b><br>Acknowledge our partial knowledge and remain humble, relying on God's wisdom and revelation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_13_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 13:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_13_12_Seek_clearer_spiritual_insight.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 13:12 encourage us to seek clearer spiritual understanding?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_dim_reflection_teach_us.htm">What does "see but a dim reflection" teach about our current spiritual perception?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_direct_God_knowledge_on_faith.htm">How can "face to face" knowledge of God impact our daily faith practice?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_Cor_13_12_with_Hebrews_5_14.htm">Connect 1 Corinthians 13:12 with another scripture about spiritual maturity.  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_know_fully_to_deepen_faith.htm">How can we apply "know fully" to deepen our relationship with God today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_does_mirror_dimly_mean_in_1_Cor_13_12.htm">What does "see in a mirror dimly" mean in 1 Corinthians 13:12?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_13_12_s_link_to_spiritual_growth.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 13:12 relate to the concept of spiritual maturity?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_does_face_to_face_mean_in_1_Cor_13_12.htm">What is the significance of "face to face" in 1 Corinthians 13:12?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_corinthians_13.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Corinthians 13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_mandela_effect.htm">What is the Mandela Effect?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_'seeing_through_a_glass_darkly'.htm">What does "seeing through a glass darkly" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_moved_us_to_his_son's_kingdom.htm">What does 'seeing through a glass darkly' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'face_to_face_with_god'_mean.htm">What does "Face to Face with God" mean?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 1 Corinthians 13:12 Mean</div><b>Now we see but a dim reflection as in a mirror</b><p>&#8220;For now we see but a dim reflection as in a mirror&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Ancient mirrors were polished metal, giving an imperfect image.

Until that day, we rest in confidence that Scripture is true, love is supreme, and the promise of unhindered fellowship with Christ is certain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">For now</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in this earthly life, the "for" connecting the previous statement with that which it illustrates.<p><span class= "bld">Through a glass, darkly.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">through</span> <span class= "ital">a</span> <span class= "ital">mirror in a dark saying.</span> The illustration here is from a mirror when the image appears far behind the mirror itself. If we remember the imperfect metal surfaces which formed the mirrors of those days, we can imagine how imperfect and enigmatical (the Greek word is "in an <span class= "ital">enigma"</span>) would the image appear; so that the Apostle says, "Like that image which you see when you look at an object in a mirror far off, with blurred and undefined outline, such is our knowledge here and now; but <span class= "ital">then</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> when this dispensation is at an end) we shall see as you see a man when you stand before him face to face.
