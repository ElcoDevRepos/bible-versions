This reflects the early Christian understanding of the church as a family, transcending biological ties. The use of "brothers" also emphasizes the equality and unity among believers, regardless of their social or economic status, which was a radical concept in the stratified society of the Roman Empire.<p><b>is that the time is short.</b><br>Paul's assertion that "the time is short" reflects an eschatological urgency prevalent in the early church. This phrase suggests an awareness of the imminent return of Christ, a theme consistent with other New Testament writings (e.g., <a href="/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11-12</a>, <a href="/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>). The early Christians lived with the expectation that Christ could return at any moment, which influenced their priorities and lifestyle choices. This sense of urgency is not just about chronological time but also about the opportunity to live faithfully in the present age.<p><b>From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none;</b><br>This statement is not a call to neglect marital responsibilities but rather an exhortation to prioritize spiritual commitments over earthly ties. In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/7.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>, Paul discusses marriage and singleness, emphasizing that both states are gifts from God and should be lived out with a focus on serving the Lord. The phrase suggests a detachment from worldly concerns, echoing Jesus' teaching in <a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a> about the cost of discipleship.

Believers&#8212;single or married&#8212;are to live with loosened grips on temporal ties, ready to obey God&#8217;s call at a moment&#8217;s notice, confident that devotion to the Lord is never wasted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">But this I say, brethren.</span>--This does not introduce a reiteration of what he has said already, but commences a solemn and affectionate warning, urging on them earnestly that, whether they applied or did not apply the principle to marriage, still that it is true, and of vast importance in regulating all life,--that men should live as ever expecting the return of the Lord. Let us not for one moment think that this principle was evolved by St. Paul from a mistaken belief that the Second Advent was close at hand. This principle of life was taught by Christ Himself. He warned men against living carelessly because they thought "the Lord delayeth His coming." They were to be ever on the watch, as servants for the unexpected return of their master--as guests for the coming of the bridegroom. It was not the opinion that Christ would soon come which led St. Paul to hold and teach this principle of Christian life. Perhaps it was his intense realisation of this eternal truth which the Lord had taught, his assimilation of it as part of his very being, from which the conviction arose that the Advent was not only in theory always, but, as a matter of fact, then near at hand. Hope and belief mysteriously mingled together in one longing unity of feeling.<p>It may be asked, if the Apostles were mistaken on this point, may they not have been mistaken about other things also? The best answer to such a question, perhaps, is that this was just <span class= "ital">the</span> one point on which our Lord had said they <span class= "ital">should not</span> be informed, and it is the one point on which they <span class= "ital">were not</span> informed. "Times and seasons" were to be excluded from their knowledge (<a href="/acts/1-6.htm" title="When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?">Acts 1:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The time is short: it remaineth . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">The time that remains is shortened, so that both they that have wives,</span> &c. (the Greek word for "remain" (<span class= "ital">to loipon</span>) is used frequently by St. Paul in a sort of adverbial way, <a href="/2_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="Finally, brothers, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.">2Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-8.htm" title="Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.">Philippians 4:8</a>). The words "so that" do not introduce a series of apostolic exhortations based upon and growing out of the previous statement regarding the brevity of the remaining time, but they express what was God's intention in thus making the time short. St. Paul regards everything as having its place and purpose in the divine economy. If the time were long (and the teaching applies equally--for the principle is the same--to the brevity of life), then, indeed, men might live as having "much goods laid up for many years" (<a href="/luke/12-19.htm" title="And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry.">Luke 12:19</a>); but the time of life is short, that each may keep himself from being the slave of the external conditions and relationships of life. Such is the force of the series of striking contrasts with which the Apostle now illustrates the habit of life which God intended to follow from the shortening of the time. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But this I say.</span> I will not dwell on those coming trials, but will only remind you that they are imminent, and that when they come all earthly distinctions will vanish into insignifiance. <span class="cmt_word">The time is short;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the season has been contracted</span>; in other words, "The end of all things is at hand" (<a href="/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>).
