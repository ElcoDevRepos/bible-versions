The concept of "shame" here is significant in the Greco-Roman world, where honor and shame were pivotal social values. Paul uses this language to emphasize the seriousness of their actions, which are contrary to the teachings of Christ. This rebuke is meant to provoke self-reflection and repentance, aligning with the biblical principle of accountability within the community of believers (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-9.htm">2 Corinthians 7:9-10</a>).<p><b>Is there really no one among you wise enough</b><br>The question underscores the expectation that the church should possess wisdom, a theme prevalent throughout the Corinthian letters. In <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>, Paul identifies Christ as the wisdom of God, suggesting that believers, being in Christ, should exhibit this wisdom. The rhetorical nature of the question implies that the church, endowed with spiritual gifts and knowledge (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5</a>), should be capable of resolving disputes internally. This reflects the Jewish tradition of settling matters within the community, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-13.htm">Deuteronomy 1:13-15</a>, where wise and discerning men were appointed as judges.<p><b>to arbitrate between his brothers?</b><br>The term "arbitrate" indicates a process of resolving disputes, which in the early church context, should be handled by spiritually mature individuals. The use of "brothers" emphasizes the familial relationship among believers, rooted in their shared faith in Christ. This familial bond is a recurring theme in the New Testament, where believers are called to love and support one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>). The failure to resolve disputes internally reflects a lack of spiritual maturity and undermines the witness of the church to the outside world, as seen in Jesus' prayer for unity among His followers in <a href="/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20-23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the Corinthian church with authority and concern for their spiritual maturity and conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled congregation in the city of Corinth, known for its moral and ethical challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/disputes_among_believers.htm">Disputes Among Believers</a></b><br>The specific issue being addressed, where members of the church were taking their disputes to secular courts rather than resolving them within the church community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_for_wisdom_in_the_church.htm">The Call for Wisdom in the Church</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes the need for wise individuals within the church to handle disputes.

Like a loving but firm father (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>), he exposes sin so that repentance can follow.<p>&#8226; The church had allowed civil courts to settle internal disputes, displaying to the watching world a practical disbelief in God&#8217;s wisdom (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-24.htm">Psalm 119:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses shame positively&#8212;to jolt believers back to obedience (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:14</a>; <a href="/titus/2-8.htm">Titus 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; By openly naming their failure, Paul reminds them that holiness is communal, not merely individual (<a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>).<p>The verse teaches that it is a disgrace, not a minor misstep, when believers ignore Spirit-given resources and let unbelievers judge family matters (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-1.htm">1 Corinthians 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is there really no one among you wise enough</b><p>The question drips with irony. Corinth prided itself on being spiritual and enlightened (1 <a href="/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5</a>; 4:10), yet could not produce a single person recognized for godly wisdom.<p>&#8226; True wisdom, Paul has already argued, is &#8220;Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God&#8221; (1 <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Such wisdom is spiritually discerned (1 <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15-16</a>), rooted in the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), and evident in good conduct (<a href="/james/3-13.htm">James 3:13</a>).<p>&#8226; If even one mature believer walked in that wisdom, petty lawsuits would not have escalated (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1-2</a>).<p>The line exposes a gap between the church&#8217;s claims and its practice, challenging every congregation to cultivate recognized, Spirit-led peacemakers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to arbitrate between his brothers?</b><p>Arbitration here means settling conflicts inside the covenant family rather than dragging them before secular judges.<p>&#8226; Jesus laid out a clear, step-by-step process for resolving disputes within the body (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The early church already appointed Spirit-filled people to handle practical conflicts (<a href="/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3-5</a>), modeling internal accountability.<p>&#8226; Even under the Old Covenant, capable men were set over smaller groups to judge everyday issues (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-22</a>).<p>By using &#8220;brothers,&#8221; Paul re-centers the relationship: litigants are family, not opposing parties. Legal victory must never outrank unity (<a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>).
