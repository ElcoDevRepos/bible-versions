Timothy was a trusted companion of Paul, having joined him during his second missionary journey (<a href="/acts/16.htm">Acts 16:1-3</a>). This act of sending Timothy underscores the relational and personal nature of Paul's ministry. Timothy's role was to act as Paul's representative, ensuring that the teachings and practices Paul established were maintained. This reflects the early church's reliance on personal relationships and trusted leaders to maintain doctrinal integrity.<p><b>my beloved and faithful child in the Lord</b><br>Paul's description of Timothy as his "beloved and faithful child" indicates a deep spiritual bond. This language of familial relationship is common in Paul's letters, emphasizing the spiritual family created through faith in Christ. Timothy's faithfulness is a testament to his character and dedication to the gospel, serving as a model for other believers. This phrase also reflects the mentoring relationship Paul had with Timothy, akin to a father-son dynamic, which was crucial for leadership development in the early church.<p><b>He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus</b><br>Timothy's mission was not only to teach but to exemplify Paul's "way of life in Christ Jesus." This phrase suggests that Christian teaching is not merely doctrinal but also practical, encompassing a lifestyle that reflects Christ's teachings. Paul's life was a living example of the gospel, and Timothy was to remind the Corinthians of this holistic approach to faith. This aligns with Paul's exhortation in <a href="/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>, "Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ," emphasizing the importance of living out one's faith.<p><b>which is exactly what I teach everywhere in every church</b><br>Paul's consistency in teaching "everywhere in every church" highlights the universality and uniformity of the apostolic message. Despite the diverse cultural and geographical contexts of the early churches, Paul's teachings remained consistent, rooted in the core truths of the gospel. This consistency was crucial for maintaining unity and doctrinal purity across the early Christian communities. It also underscores the apostolic authority with which Paul spoke, ensuring that the foundational truths of Christianity were preserved and propagated accurately.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians.

In short, <a href="/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a> declares that authentic ministry is transferable, observable, and universally binding on the people of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">For this cause.</span>--When St. Paul contemplated a visit to the churches in Macedonia and Achaia he sent Timothy and Erastus in advance (<a href="/context/acts/19-21.htm" title="After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.">Acts 19:21-22</a>). It is to this fact allusion is here made--from <a href="/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1Corinthians 16:10</a>, we see that the Apostle did not calculate on Timothy's arrival in Corinth until after this letter had reached them. The rumours of the existence of factions in Corinth had reached St. Paul before Timothy had departed, and were the cause of his desire that before himself visiting Corinth Timothy should do so, and bring the Corinthians to a better frame of mind before the Apostle's arrival. After Timothy's departure from Ephesus the Apostle heard from the household of Chloe how very much worse than he had imagined from the previous rumours was the state of affairs at Corinth. It would not do to let such a condition of things continue to grow and intensify until Timothy should arrive there, delayed as he would be in visiting other places in Macedonia and Achaia <span class= "ital">en route.</span> Nor, indeed, would it be safe to leave one of Timothy's nervous (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1Corinthians 16:10</a>) and gentle temperament (perhaps the result of his having been brought up and educated entirely by women, <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm" title="When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in you also.">2Timothy 1:5</a>) to deal with such a state of anarchy as the Apostle now knew to exist in Corinth. Further, the letter from Corinth had arrived since Timothy had left, and it required an immediate answer. Such reason, doubtless, influenced St. Paul in sending this letter to Corinth at once so as to anticipate the arrival of Timothy there. That you might return to the dutiful position of sons, I sent you one who is a son--a beloved and a faithful spiritual child--who will not be an addition to the too numerous instructors already at Corinth, but will, by what he says, and by his own example, remind you of my teaching (see <a href="/2_timothy/3-10.htm" title="But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,">2Timothy 3:10</a>), which he fully understands, and which never varies, being the same to every church. The emphatic use of the word "my son" here in reference to Timothy, taken in connection with the clear expression in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-15.htm" title="For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.">1Corinthians 4:15</a> of what was involved in that spiritual relationship, shows that St. Paul had converted Timothy to the faith (<a href="/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:">Acts 16:1</a>). In the Second Epistle to the Corinthians St. Paul speaks of Timothy as his "brother" (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2Corinthians 1:1</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this cause.</span> Because, as your spiritual father, I naturally take the deepest interest in your well being.

St. Paul, on hearing the grave news from Corinth, seems to have countermanded him (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>, "<span class="accented">If</span> Timotheus come"), but was uncertain whether the messenger would reach him in time.

He is not sending the youthful Timothy as an authoritative teacher, since the Corinthians, fond of high pretension and soaring oratory, might scorn to show any submission to a shy and shrinking youth; but he is only sending him because, as his closest companion, Timothy would be best able to explain to them his plans and wishes in the organization of Churches. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">That is why</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have sent</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#960;&#949;&#956;&#968;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(epempsa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3992.htm">Strong's 3992: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send, transmit, permit to go, put forth. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
