As an apostle, he is providing guidance to the Corinthian church, which was dealing with issues of division and confusion regarding spiritual gifts. This phrase sets the tone for the authoritative teaching that follows.<p><b>that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, &#8220;Jesus be cursed,&#8221;</b><br>In the context of the early church, there were various spiritual manifestations, and discernment was necessary to identify true expressions of the Holy Spirit. The phrase "Jesus be cursed" would be anathema to any true believer, as it contradicts the core of Christian faith. Historically, this may reflect the challenges faced by early Christians in distinguishing between true and false prophets, as well as the influence of pagan practices and Jewish opposition to the Christian message.<p><b>and no one can say, &#8220;Jesus is Lord,&#8221;</b><br>The confession "Jesus is Lord" is central to Christian belief, affirming the divinity and authority of Christ. This statement is a direct challenge to the Roman imperial cult, where Caesar was often declared as lord. It also connects to the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, emphasizing the monotheistic belief in one God, now revealed in Jesus Christ. This confession is a hallmark of genuine Christian faith and is echoed in other New Testament passages such as <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>.<p><b>except by the Holy Spirit.</b><br>The Holy Spirit is the source of true confession and faith in Jesus Christ. This underscores the role of the Spirit in the life of believers, enabling them to recognize and proclaim the lordship of Jesus. It highlights the transformative work of the Spirit, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13-14</a>, where the Spirit guides believers into all truth.

It is evident, however, that such expressions <span class="accented">had</span> been uttered by persons who were, or seemed to be, carried away by the impassioned impulse which led to "glossolaly." (It is better to use this technical word in order to dissipate the cloud of strange misconceptions as to the true nature of this <span class="accented">charism.</span>) So terrible an outrage on the conscience of Christians could never have passed unchecked and unpunished, except from the obvious inability of the young community to grapple with the new and perplexing phenomena of an "inspiration" which appeared to destroy the personal control of those possessed by it. Among Jewish converts glossolaly was regarded as a form of that wild mantle "inspiration" of which we find some traces in Jewish history (<a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10, 11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/19-23.htm">1 Samuel 19:23, 24</a>, etc.), and which was alluded to in the very name <span class="accented">Nabo</span>, which implied a boiling energy. Among Gentile converts the glossolaly would be classed with the overmastering influences of which they read, or which they witnessed, in the Sibyls, the Pythian priestesses, and the wild orgiastic devotees of Eastern cults.
