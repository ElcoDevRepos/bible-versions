This testimony is rooted in the historical events of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. The apostles were eyewitnesses to these events, and their testimony is foundational to the Christian faith (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8, 1</a> <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>). The term "testimony" underscores the legal and authoritative nature of their witness, akin to a courtroom setting where truth is established by reliable witnesses. This testimony is not just a recounting of events but a proclamation of the transformative power of the Gospel (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<p><b>was confirmed in you</b><br>The confirmation of the testimony in the Corinthians is evidenced by the spiritual gifts and transformation in their lives (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). This confirmation is both an internal witness of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a>) and an external manifestation of changed lives and spiritual gifts (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). The word "confirmed" suggests a process of validation and strengthening, indicating that the Corinthians' faith was not based on mere words but on the power of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4-5</a>). This transformation serves as a testament to the truth of the Gospel and the work of the Holy Spirit in the believers' lives, fulfilling the promise of Jesus that His followers would do greater works (<a href="/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the church in Corinth.

He reminds them that the grace of God evident in their lives validates the gospel he preached. <a href="/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1-11</a> records how Paul first delivered that gospel in Corinth; God told him, &#8220;I have many people in this city,&#8221; and Paul stayed eighteen months teaching the word (v. 11). By the time he writes this letter, their transformed lives stand as living proof that &#8220;the message of the cross&#8230;is the power of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Our testimony about Christ&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s &#8220;testimony&#8221; is the simple, historical proclamation that &#8220;Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures&#8230;was buried&#8230;was raised on the third day&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; He insists that he and his co-workers &#8220;did not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; From the start, he presented the gospel &#8220;in weakness and in fear&#8221; so that faith would rest &#8220;not on men&#8217;s wisdom, but on God&#8217;s power&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</a>).<p>Cross references within this section&#8212;<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:3-4</a>&#8212;underline that Paul viewed his own message as God&#8217;s unchanging, authoritative truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Was confirmed in you&#8221;</b><p>&#8220;Confirmed&#8221; means established as true, proven beyond doubt by evidence.
