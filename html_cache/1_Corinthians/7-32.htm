This reflects Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>, where He encourages His followers not to worry about their lives. The context of <a href="/1_corinthians/7.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a> is Paul's guidance on marriage and singleness, emphasizing that freedom from worldly concerns allows for undivided devotion to God. Historically, Corinth was a bustling city with many distractions, making Paul's advice particularly relevant.<p><b>The unmarried man is concerned about the work of the Lord,</b><br>Paul highlights the advantage of singleness in serving God. In the early church, many leaders, including Paul himself, were unmarried, allowing them to dedicate their lives fully to ministry. This reflects a broader biblical theme where singleness is seen as a gift (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7</a>) that enables a person to focus on spiritual matters without the added responsibilities of a family. The cultural context of the time placed significant expectations on married individuals, which could detract from their ability to serve the church.<p><b>how he can please the Lord.</b><br>The focus here is on pleasing God, a central theme throughout Scripture. In <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1-2</a>, believers are urged to offer their bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God. The unmarried man, free from familial obligations, can more readily pursue this goal. This phrase also connects to the idea of living a life that reflects Christ's teachings and character, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-10.htm">Ephesians 5:10</a>, where believers are encouraged to find out what pleases the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on marriage and singleness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled early Christian community dealing with issues of morality, spiritual gifts, and church order.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/unmarried_individuals.htm">Unmarried Individuals</a></b><br>Paul specifically addresses those who are unmarried, highlighting their potential for undivided devotion to the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/undivided_devotion.htm">Undivided Devotion</a></b><br>Paul highlights the advantage of singleness in allowing for a focused commitment to the Lord's work.

That is my reason for so advising you. And here the Apostle returns to the subject immediately under consideration, and shows here what he has been saying bears upon it.
