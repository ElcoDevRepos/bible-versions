Adam, as the first human, is seen as the representative head of humanity. His disobedience to God by eating the forbidden fruit brought sin and death into the world (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). This death is both physical and spiritual, signifying separation from God. The idea of all dying in Adam underscores the universal impact of sin, affecting every human being. Theologically, this is often linked to the doctrine of total depravity, which suggests that every part of human nature is tainted by sin.<p><b>so in Christ all will be made alive</b><br>This phrase presents the contrasting hope found in Jesus Christ, often referred to as the "second Adam" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>). Through His death and resurrection, Christ offers redemption and the promise of eternal life to all who believe in Him (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). This "being made alive" is not just a future physical resurrection but also a present spiritual renewal (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). Theologically, this is connected to the concept of justification and sanctification, where believers are declared righteous and are progressively made holy. The phrase emphasizes the universality of Christ's redemptive work, available to all, contrasting the death brought by Adam with the life offered by Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, whose disobedience led to the fall of humanity and the introduction of sin and death into the world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ (Jesus Christ)</a></b><br>The Son of God, whose death and resurrection provide the means for eternal life and the resurrection of believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece where the Apostle Paul established a church and to whom he wrote this letter, addressing various theological and practical issues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, who wrote to the church in Corinth to correct misunderstandings about the resurrection and to affirm the hope of eternal life through Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection.htm">Resurrection</a></b><br>The event of Jesus rising from the dead, which is central to Christian faith and the hope of believers' future resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_death_in_adam.htm">The Universality of Death in Adam</a></b><br>Adam's sin brought death to all humanity, highlighting the pervasive impact of sin and the need for redemption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_life_in_christ.htm">The Universality of Life in Christ</a></b><br>Just as death came through Adam, life comes through Christ.

The text celebrates the certainty, not the scope beyond believers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Adam&#8217;s legacy is death; Christ&#8217;s legacy is life. Every human being is born into the first story, but God invites us into the second by faith in His risen Son. The verse sets two representative men side by side and assures us that Christ&#8217;s triumph is as real and far-reaching for His people as Adam&#8217;s failure is for the human race.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">As in Adam . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">as in the Adam all die, so in the Christ shall all be made alive.</span> The first Adam and the second Adam here stand as the heads of Humanity. All that is fleshly in our nature is inherited from the Adam; in every true son of God it is dying daily, and will ultimately die altogether. All that is spiritual in our nature we inherit from the Christ; it is immortal, is rising daily, will ultimately be raised with a spiritual and immortal body. We must remember that the relationship of Christ to Humanity is not to be dated only from the Incarnation. Christ stood in the same federal relation to all who went before as He does to all who have come since. (See the same thought in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.">1Corinthians 10:4</a>, and in Christ's own words, "Before Abraham was, I am.") The results of Christ's death are co-extensive with the results of Adam's fall--they extend to all men; but the individual responsibility rests with each man as to which he will cherish--that which he derives from Christ or that which he derives from Adam--the "offence" of Adam or the "grace" of Christ. The best comment on this passage is, perhaps, the prayer in the Baptismal Office: "O merciful God, grant that the old Adam in this child may be so buried, that the new man may be raised up in him." There seems to be this moral significance in these words of St. Paul, as well as the obvious argument that, as all men die physically, so all shall be raised from the dead; as we have the evidence of death in the death of a man and of all men, so we have the evidence (and not the mere theoretical promise) of a resurrection in the resurrection of the Man Christ Jesus.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As in Adam all die.</span> All of us partake of Adam's nature, and are therefore liable to the death which that nature incurred as the law and condition of its humanity. <span class="cmt_word">In Christ shall all be made alive.</span> It is St. Paul's invariable habit to isolate his immediate subject; to think and to treat of one topic at a time. He is not here thinking directly and immediately of the resurrection in general. In this verse, writing to Christians who are "in Christ," he is only thinking and speaking of the resurrection of those who are "in Christ." That any can be <span class="accented">nominally</span> "in Christ," yet not <span class="accented">really</span> so, is a fact which is not at present under his cognizance; still less is he thinking of the world in general. In other words, he is here dealing with "the resurrection of life" alone, and not also with the "resurrection of judgment" (<a href="/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26-29</a>). Still, as far as his words alone are concerned, it is so impossible to understand the phrase, "shall all be made alive," of a resurrection to endless torments, that his language at least <span class="accented">suggests</span> the conclusion that "the principle which has come to actuality in Christ is of sufficient energy to quicken <span class="accented">all men</span> for the resurrection to the blessed life" (Baur, 'Life of St. Paul,' 2:219). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8037;&#963;&#960;&#949;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;sper)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5618.htm">Strong's 5618: </a> </span><span class="str2">Just as, as, even as.
