This gift, often seen as a sign of the Holy Spirit's presence, was particularly significant in the context of the early Christian community, which was diverse and multilingual. Speaking in tongues served as a miraculous sign to unbelievers and a means of personal edification. However, Paul emphasizes that this gift should not be the primary focus of the church's spiritual life.<p><b>but I would rather have you prophesy</b><br>Paul prioritizes prophecy over speaking in tongues, highlighting its greater value for the church. Prophecy, in this context, refers to speaking forth God's message to the people, which includes teaching, exhortation, and encouragement. This gift is more beneficial for the congregation as it builds up the church, providing clear and understandable communication of God's will. The emphasis on prophecy aligns with the broader biblical narrative, where prophets played crucial roles in guiding and correcting God's people.<p><b>He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues</b><br>Paul establishes a hierarchy of spiritual gifts based on their utility for edification. Prophecy is considered greater because it directly benefits the entire church body, unlike tongues, which primarily edify the individual unless interpreted. This statement reflects the principle that spiritual gifts should be exercised for the common good, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>, where Paul discusses the purpose of spiritual gifts in the body of Christ.<p><b>unless he interprets so that the church may be edified</b><br>The condition of interpretation underscores the importance of understanding and clarity in worship. When tongues are interpreted, they can serve a similar purpose to prophecy by conveying a message that edifies the church. This requirement for interpretation ensures that all spiritual gifts contribute to the building up of the church, aligning with Paul's broader teaching on order and edification in worship, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26-33</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and extensive writings that form a significant portion of the New Testament.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled congregation in the city of Corinth, known for its spiritual gifts but also for its divisions and moral challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/speaking_in_tongues.htm">Speaking in Tongues</a></b><br>A spiritual gift involving speaking in languages unknown to the speaker, often seen as a sign of the Holy Spirit's presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophecy.htm">Prophecy</a></b><br>Another spiritual gift, involving speaking messages from God for the edification, encouragement, and comfort of the church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_superiority_of_prophecy_for_edification.htm">The Superiority of Prophecy for Edification</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes that prophecy is more beneficial to the church than speaking in tongues unless there is interpretation.

The teacher of religious truth to others, who thereby builds up the whole edifice of the body of Christ, is a greater one than he who is himself benefited by being possessed of profound but uncommunicable emotion.<p><span class= "bld">Except he interpret.</span>--The gift of interpreting might therefore belong to the same person who had the gift of tongues: and if he had this power of articulating for the benefit of others the emotion which he incoherently expresses in reverie, then the gift of tongues was useful to the Church at large, and so was as valuable as prophecy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I would that ye all spake with tongues.</span> The language of <span class="accented">relative</span> disparagement which St. Paul uses throughout these chapters may lead us to regard this with surprise. Yet it is perfectly intelligible. Montanus truly said that each human spirit is like a harp, which the Holy Spirit strikes as with a <span class="accented">plectrum</span>, and which yields itself to the mighty hand by which the chords are swept. We have seen all along - and history has in various ages confirmed the impression, on every occasion when these phenomena have been reproduced in seasons of great spiritual revival - that the external <span class="accented">symptoms</span> may be imitated with most dangerous and objectionable results both to the speaker and to others. But when the expression is <span class="accented">genuine</span>, the fact that the tides of the Spirit can thus sweep through the narrow channels of individuality is in itself a sign that the spirit of the man is alive and not dead; and thus he is an evidence of God's power both to himself and to others. Those who have heard "the tongue" have told me that its force, melody, and penetrative quality produced an impression not to be forgotten. When we see the stuffed and stopped-up hearts and lives of thousands of frivolous and worldly money worshippers, we might well echo St. Paul's wish. <span class="cmt_word">Greater</span>. Not of necessity greater absolutely or morally, but greater in the fact of his wider and deeper usefulness. <span class="cmt_word">Except he interpret.</span> From this we infer that sometimes, when the passion had spent its force, the speaker in the tongue could give rational explanation of the thoughts and feelings to which he had given ecstatic utterance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/14-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I wish that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#941;&#955;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(Thel&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2309.htm">Strong's 2309: </a> </span><span class="str2">To will, wish, desire, be willing, intend, design. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pantas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
