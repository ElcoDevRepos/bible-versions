In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul is addressing various issues within the Corinthian church, including questions about marriage. The use of "command" suggests a directive that carries authority, reflecting the seriousness of the matter. Marriage, as instituted by God in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, is a covenant relationship, and Paul is emphasizing its sanctity and permanence.<p><b>(not I, but the Lord):</b><br>Here, Paul distinguishes between his own apostolic advice and a direct command from Jesus. This reference to the Lord's teaching likely points to Jesus' teachings on marriage and divorce found in the Gospels, such as <a href="/matthew/5-31.htm">Matthew 5:31-32</a> and <a href="/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3-9</a>. These passages emphasize the permanence of marriage and the limited grounds for divorce, underscoring the divine origin of this command.<p><b>A wife must not separate from her husband.</b><br>This instruction reflects the cultural and historical context of the time, where marriage was a foundational social institution. The term "separate" implies a physical and relational departure, which was a significant issue in the Greco-Roman world. The command aligns with the biblical view of marriage as a lifelong commitment, as seen in <a href="/malachi/2-16.htm">Malachi 2:16</a>, where God expresses His disdain for divorce. The emphasis on the wife's role may reflect the societal norms of the time, but the underlying principle is the mutual commitment and unity expected in marriage. This teaching also connects to the broader biblical theme of faithfulness, mirroring God's covenantal faithfulness to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Corinthians, providing guidance to the early Christian church on various issues, including marriage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled congregation in the city of Corinth, dealing with issues of morality and church order.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Jesus Christ)</a></b><br>Referenced by Paul as the ultimate authority behind the command given, emphasizing the divine origin of the instruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/married_couples.htm">Married Couples</a></b><br>The specific group addressed in this verse, highlighting the sanctity and permanence of the marriage covenant.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/separation.htm">Separation</a></b><br>The act being prohibited in this command, indicating the importance of maintaining marital unity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority_in_marriage.htm">Divine Authority in Marriage</a></b><br>The command given is not merely Paul's opinion but is rooted in the teachings of Jesus.

St. Paul must not therefore be regarded as here claiming for some of his instructions apostolic authority, and not claiming it for others. The real point of the contrast is between a subject on which our Lord Himself while on earth gave direct verbal instruction, and another subject on which He now gives His commands through His Apostle St. Paul. Christ had given directions regarding divorce (<a href="/matthew/5-31.htm" title="It has been said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce:">Matthew 5:31</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/19-3.htm" title="The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?">Matthew 19:3-9</a>; <a href="/context/mark/10-2.htm" title="And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.">Mark 10:2-12</a>), and the Apostle here has only to reiterate what the Lord had already commanded. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Unto the married;</span> to <span class="accented">Christians</span> who have already married. <span class="cmt_word">I command.</span> This is an injunction, not a mere permission as in ver. 6. <span class="cmt_word">Not I,</span> <span class="cmt_word">but the Lord.</span> Because the rule had been laid down by Christ himself (<a href="/mark/10-11.htm">Mark 10:11, 12</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>; <a href="/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let not the wife depart.</span> By divorce or otherwise.
