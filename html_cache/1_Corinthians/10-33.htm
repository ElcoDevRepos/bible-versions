This reflects his broader strategy of becoming "all things to all people" (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>) to win them to Christ. The cultural context of Corinth, a diverse and cosmopolitan city, required sensitivity to various cultural and religious backgrounds. Paul's aim was not to compromise the gospel but to remove unnecessary barriers to its acceptance. This approach is consistent with Jesus' example of humility and service (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-7</a>), where He engaged with people from all walks of life.<p><b>For I am not seeking my own good,</b><br>Paul emphasizes his selflessness, a key characteristic of Christian leadership. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>, where He states that He came not to be served but to serve. In a culture that often prioritized personal gain and status, Paul's attitude was countercultural. His focus was on the welfare of others, aligning with the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor as oneself (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>; <a href="/mark/12-31.htm">Mark 12:31</a>). This self-denial is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, urging believers to put others' needs above their own (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>).<p><b>but the good of many,</b><br>Paul's ministry was driven by a desire to benefit as many people as possible. This reflects the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations. The "good" Paul refers to is not merely temporal or material but spiritual and eternal. His focus was on the edification and salvation of others, aligning with the biblical mandate to be a light to the world (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>). This perspective is rooted in the understanding that God's love and salvation are available to all, transcending cultural and ethnic boundaries.<p><b>that they may be saved.</b><br>The ultimate goal of Paul's efforts was the salvation of others. This aligns with the core message of the gospel, which is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). Salvation, in the biblical sense, involves deliverance from sin and reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ. Paul's missionary journeys and epistles consistently emphasize this redemptive purpose. His statement here underscores the urgency and importance of evangelism, reflecting God's desire for all people to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, providing guidance on how to live a life that reflects Christ's teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and cultural influences, which presented unique challenges for the early Christian community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a group of believers navigating the complexities of living out their faith in a secular and often morally challenging environment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/selflessness_in_service.htm">Selflessness in Service</a></b><br>Paul models a life of selflessness, prioritizing the spiritual well-being of others over personal gain.

The verse invites believers to joyful self-denial so that many more will meet the Savior.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">Even as I please all men . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">even as I in all things am seeking to please all men, not seeking my own profit, but that of the many</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the whole great mass of men, and not, as the English seems to imply, merely "a great number." This is the same idea as "I am made all things to all men."

This is the completion of the exhortation. The Apostle refers to his own example, but only to lead his readers up to Christ as the great example of One "who pleased not Himself" (<a href="/romans/15-3.htm" title="For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached you fell on me.">Romans 15:3</a>). His own example is valuable inasmuch as it is the example of one who is striving to conform to the image of his Lord. With the mention of the holiest Example and the most sacred Name, the whole of this argument and exhortation reaches its natural climax and conclusion.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they may be saved.</span> All the sympathy, tolerance, forbearance, which I try to practise has this one supreme object. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/10-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">just as I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kath&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2531.htm">Strong's 2531: </a> </span><span class="str2">According to the manner in which, in the degree that, just as, as.
