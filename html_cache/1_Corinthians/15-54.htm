The "perishable" signifies our current mortal bodies, subject to decay and death. The "imperishable" indicates the glorified bodies believers will receive, which are eternal and incorruptible. This transformation is a fulfillment of God's promise of eternal life, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</a>, where Paul contrasts the natural body with the spiritual body. The imagery of clothing suggests a complete change, akin to putting on new garments, symbolizing the new creation in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p><b>and the mortal with immortality</b><br>"Mortal" refers to the human condition of being subject to death. "Immortality" signifies the eternal life that believers will inherit. This transformation is a key aspect of Christian eschatology, where death is no longer a threat. The concept of immortality is rooted in the hope of resurrection, as Jesus Himself demonstrated through His victory over death (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>). This promise of immortality is a central tenet of the Christian faith, offering assurance of life beyond physical death.<p><b>then the saying that is written will come to pass</b><br>This phrase introduces the fulfillment of prophecy. Paul is referencing Old Testament scripture to show that the resurrection is part of God's redemptive plan. The use of "the saying that is written" underscores the authority and reliability of Scripture. It highlights the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, affirming that the resurrection is not a new concept but one that has been anticipated throughout biblical history.<p><b>&#8220;Death has been swallowed up in victory.&#8221;</b><br>This quotation is a reference to <a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>, where God promises to destroy death forever. The imagery of death being "swallowed up" suggests a complete and final defeat, emphasizing the totality of Christ's victory over death through His resurrection. This victory is not just a future hope but a present reality for believers, as it assures them of their ultimate triumph over sin and death. The phrase also echoes <a href="/hosea/13-14.htm">Hosea 13:14</a>, where God declares His power over death. This victory is a central theme in Christian theology, symbolizing the culmination of God's redemptive work through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, providing them with theological insights and practical guidance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and cultural influences.
