The early church in Corinth was experiencing factionalism, with different groups claiming allegiance to various leaders such as Paul, Apollos, and Cephas (Peter). The question implies that Christ, as the head of the church, cannot be divided. This reflects the unity that should exist among believers, as emphasized in <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>, which speaks of one body and one Spirit. Theologically, it underscores the indivisibility of Christ's body, the church, and calls believers to unity in Him.<p><b>Was Paul crucified for you?</b><br>Paul uses this question to highlight the centrality of Christ's crucifixion in the gospel message. By asking if he was crucified for them, Paul emphasizes that salvation comes through Jesus Christ alone, not through any human leader. This reflects the core Christian doctrine of substitutionary atonement, where Christ's death on the cross paid the penalty for sin. Historically, crucifixion was a Roman method of execution, and its use here underscores the gravity and significance of Christ's sacrifice. This question also serves to remind the Corinthians that their faith should be rooted in Christ's work, not in human leaders.<p><b>Were you baptized into the name of Paul?</b><br>Baptism in the early church was a public declaration of faith and identification with Christ. By asking if they were baptized into his name, Paul points out the absurdity of aligning themselves with him or any other leader instead of Christ. Baptism signifies being united with Christ in His death and resurrection, as explained in <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>. This question reinforces the idea that believers are to be identified with Christ alone. It also reflects the practice of baptism in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as instructed in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, emphasizing the Trinitarian nature of Christian faith and the believer's allegiance to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose unity is emphasized in this verse.

Because Jesus is literally one Person and the head of one body (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>), any fracture among believers contradicts His very nature.<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself prayed &#8220;that they may all be one&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>). Unity is therefore not optional; it flows from the Lord&#8217;s own heart.<p>&#8226; The Spirit makes that unity real&#8212;&#8220;one body and one Spirit&#8230; one Lord, one faith, one baptism&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3-6</a>).<p>&#8226; When rivalry surfaces, it signals carnality (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>). Paul wants the Corinthians to see that party-spirit for what it is: an assault on the integrity of Christ&#8217;s body.<p>Takeaway: We cannot claim loyalty to Jesus while nurturing factions. If Christ is not divided, His church must not be either.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was Paul crucified for you?</b><p>&#8220;Was Paul crucified for you?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-13.htm">1 Corinthians 1:13</a>b)<p>&#8226; The cross is the centerpiece of the gospel&#8212;Christ &#8220;bore our sins in His body on the tree&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>) and &#8220;became a curse for us&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<p>&#8226; No apostle, pastor, or teacher could ever take that place. Even Paul, with all his authority, insists he is only a servant (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Elevating any leader to a savior-like status is spiritual folly and robs Christ of exclusive glory. &#8220;There is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>).<p>Takeaway: Our allegiance is fixed on the One who literally died and rose for us. Every Christian leader stands on level ground at the foot of that cross.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Were you baptized into the name of Paul?</b><p>&#8220;Were you baptized into the name of Paul?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-13.htm">1 Corinthians 1:13</a>c)<p>&#8226; Baptism publicly declares union with Jesus&#8212;&#8220;all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death&#8221; (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The command is clear: &#8220;baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p>&#8226; To be baptized &#8220;into the name&#8221; means to come under the authority and ownership of that person. Paul wants the Corinthians to remember whose name is on them: Christ&#8217;s, not Paul&#8217;s or any other leader&#8217;s.<p>&#8226; Through that one baptism we &#8220;were all baptized into one body&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>), reinforcing again the unity already purchased by Jesus.<p>Takeaway: Our identity, authority, and future are wrapped up in Christ&#8217;s name alone. Baptism points us away from human personalities and straight to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s three rapid-fire questions expose the absurdity of party loyalties in Corinth. Christ is one, Christ alone was crucified, and Christ&#8217;s name alone seals believers in baptism. Therefore, every division based on human leaders must dissolve in the light of who Jesus is and what He has done. Unity is not a preference&#8212;it is the practical outworking of the gospel in a church that belongs wholly to its undivided, crucified, and risen Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Is Christ divided?</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Christ is divided.</span> Christ, in the communion of the Church, is rent, torn in fragments by you. The mention of the sacred name as a party-cry makes the Apostle burst into that impassioned exclamation. Then there is a momentary pause, and the Apostle goes back from his sudden denunciation of the "Christ" party, to those whom he had originally selected for typical treatment, viz., those who bore his own name, the two streams of thought, as it were, mingling and rushing together; and he asks (with a mind still full of the burning indignation aroused by the mention of the name of union as a symbol of disunion), "Was Paul crucified for you?" "Was your baptism in the name of Paul?" To each of which the answer must of necessity be "No."<p>Paul being the founder of the Church, these questions apply more forcibly to the others also.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is Christ divided?</span> Has Christ been parcelled into fragments? "Is there a Pauline, a Petrine, an Apollonian, a Christian Christ?" Whether you call yourselves Liberals, or Intellectualists, or Catholics, or Bible Christians, your party spirit is a sin, and all the worse a sin because it pranks itself out in the guise of pure religious zeal. This is more forcible than to take the clause affirmatively:" Christ has been parcelled into fragments." In either ease we see" the tragic result of party spirit." <span class="cmt_word">Was Paul crucified for you?</span> Again he rebukes the partisanship which attached itself to his own name. This showed a splendid courage and honesty. The introduction of the question by the negative <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> expresses astonished indignation: "Can you possibly make a watchword of the name of a mere man, as though he had been crucified for you?" This outburst of feeling is very important, as proving the immeasurable distance which, in Paul's own view, separated him from his Lord. It is also instructive to see how St. Paul at once denounces the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of party without deigning to enter into the question as to <span class="accented">which</span> party of these wrangling "theologians" was most or least in the right.
