The "others" likely refers to other apostles or church leaders who have received support from the Corinthian church. This reflects the early church practice where leaders were often supported by the community, as seen in passages like <a href="/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>, where Jesus instructs His disciples that "the worker deserves his wages." The principle of supporting those who labor in ministry is rooted in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>, which Paul also references earlier in this chapter.<p><b>shouldn&#8217;t we have it all the more?</b><br>Paul argues that he and Barnabas, as apostles who have labored extensively in establishing the Corinthian church, have an even greater claim to this support. This rhetorical question emphasizes the sacrifices Paul has made for the sake of the gospel. His apostolic authority and the fruits of his labor in Corinth provide a strong basis for this claim. This reflects a broader biblical principle that those who sow spiritual seed should reap material benefits, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>.<p><b>But we did not exercise this right.</b><br>Despite having the right to receive support, Paul chose not to exercise it. This decision highlights his commitment to the gospel and his desire to avoid any potential obstacles to its spread. By foregoing his rights, Paul sets an example of self-sacrifice and prioritizes the spiritual well-being of the Corinthians over his own material needs. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized servanthood and self-denial (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>Instead, we put up with anything</b><br>Paul's willingness to endure hardships without receiving support underscores his dedication to his mission. This phrase suggests a readiness to face any challenge or deprivation for the sake of the gospel. It reflects the broader theme of suffering for Christ found throughout the New Testament, such as in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>, where Paul lists the many trials he has endured.<p><b>rather than hinder the gospel of Christ.</b><br>Paul's ultimate concern is that nothing should obstruct the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. By refusing support, he removes any potential accusation that he is preaching for personal gain, thus maintaining the integrity of his ministry. This reflects the apostolic priority of ensuring that the gospel is presented clearly and without compromise, as seen in passages like <a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-18</a>, where Paul rejoices that Christ is preached regardless of personal circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

Scripture consistently teaches that those who minister the Word may receive material help: <a href="/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a> speaks of sharing &#8220;all good things&#8221; with the teacher, and <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17&#8211;18</a> cites &#8220;Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.&#8221; By stating that &#8220;others&#8221; already claim this privilege, Paul acknowledges a recognized, legitimate pattern in the church&#8212;one fully rooted in biblical precedent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shouldn&#8217;t we have it all the more?</b><p>Next Paul writes, &#8220;&#8230;shouldn&#8217;t we have it all the more?&#8221; As an apostle who planted the Corinthian congregation (<a href="/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1&#8211;11</a>) and invested deeply in their spiritual life, Paul&#8217;s claim is even stronger than that of ordinary ministers. His apostolic labor included:<p>&#8226; Foundational evangelism (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>)<p>&#8226; Miraculous confirmation of the message (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>)<p>&#8226; Continual intercession and counsel (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>)<p>Given such intensive service, he rightly argues that receiving support would be appropriate, just as the priests lived from temple offerings (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8&#8211;12</a>). The principle is clear: greater spiritual investment reasonably warrants material return.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But we did not exercise this right</b><p>Paul immediately adds, &#8220;But we did not exercise this right.&#8221; Though entitled, he voluntarily declined financial assistance from Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-7.htm">2 Corinthians 11:7&#8211;9</a>). His refusal was not due to uncertainty about the right itself&#8212;Scripture affirms that right&#8212;but sprang from pastoral discernment. He chose self-support through tentmaking so the gospel would be perceived as a free gift. This echoes his stance in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>, where he &#8220;worked night and day&#8221; to avoid burdening new believers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ</b><p>Finally, Paul explains his motive: &#8220;Instead, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ.&#8221; He endured hardship&#8212;manual labor, lack of income, possible misjudgment&#8212;to remove every obstacle to faith (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-3.htm">2 Corinthians 6:3</a>, &#8220;We put no obstacle in anyone&#8217;s way&#8221;). By foregoing his legitimate rights, Paul embodied Christ-like self-denial (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5&#8211;8</a>). The lesson is twofold:<p>&#8226; Ministers have a God-given right to material support.<p>&#8226; In certain contexts, love may lead them to relinquish that right for the gospel&#8217;s advance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12</a> teaches that those who preach have a biblical claim to material support, yet love may call them to waive that claim so nothing mars the message of Christ.
