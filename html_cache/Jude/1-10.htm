In the context of Jude, these men are likely those who have infiltrated the Christian community, spreading false doctrines and leading others astray. The act of slandering what they do not understand highlights their ignorance and arrogance. This echoes the warning in <a href="/2_peter/2-12.htm">2 Peter 2:12</a>, where similar language is used to describe false teachers. The biblical context suggests a lack of spiritual discernment and a rejection of divine revelation, reminiscent of the Pharisees' misunderstanding of Jesus' teachings.<p><b>and like irrational animals</b><br>The comparison to irrational animals emphasizes the base and instinctual nature of these individuals. In biblical times, animals were often seen as lacking reason and acting purely on instinct. This imagery is used to convey the idea that these men are driven by their sinful desires rather than by the Spirit. The cultural context of the time would have understood this as a severe critique, as rationality and wisdom were highly valued. This phrase also connects to <a href="/psalms/49-20.htm">Psalm 49:20</a>, which contrasts the understanding of man with the mindlessness of beasts.<p><b>they will be destroyed by the things they do instinctively</b><br>This part of the verse serves as a warning of the inevitable judgment that awaits those who live according to their sinful nature. The destruction mentioned is both a natural consequence of their actions and a divine judgment. Theologically, this reflects the principle of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>, where living according to the flesh leads to corruption. The phrase underscores the biblical theme of divine justice, where those who reject God's truth and live by their instincts face ultimate destruction. This destruction is not just physical but spiritual, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of eternal separation from God for the unrepentant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jude.htm">Jude</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally understood to be Jude, the brother of James and half-brother of Jesus.

The corresponding passage in <a href="/2_peter/2-12.htm">2 Peter 2:12</a> is less definite. Here we have two pointed statements, one referring to the railers at dignities, the other to the defilers of the flesh in verse 8. <span class="cmt_word">But these rail at whatsoever things they know not: and what they understand naturally, like the creatures without reason, in those</span> <span class="cmt_word">things are they destroyed.</span> So the Revised Version renders it, with much more precision than the Authorized Version, and preserving the distinction which appears in the original between two verbs," knowing" and "understanding," applied to two different classes of objects. The idea is that high and holy objects are beyond their knowledge, and their understanding is limited to the senses, the physical wants and appetites which they have in common with the brutes. In the case of the former they are rash and profane of speech where they should be silent and restrained; in the case of the latter they use them only to their own undoing. The turn of the phrase, "in these they are destroyed" (or, "destroy themselves"), indicates, perhaps, how absolutely they are lost in the service of the physical appetites. The words which Milton makes the tempter use of himself have been cited as a parallel to this verse - <p><span class="accented">"I was at first as other beasts that graze<br />The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low,<br />As was my food;</span> nor aught but food discerned<br />Or sex, and apprehended nothing high."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Paradise Lost,' 9:571-574.</span>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jude/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">These [men],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(houtoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">however,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">slander</span><br /><span class="grk">&#946;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#966;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(blasph&#275;mousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_987.htm">Strong's 987: </a> </span><span class="str2">From blasphemos; to vilify; specially, to speak impiously.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">what</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hosa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3745.htm">Strong's 3745: </a> </span><span class="str2">How much, how great, how many, as great as, as much.
