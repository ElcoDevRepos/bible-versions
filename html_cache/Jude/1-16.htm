The term "grumblers" echoes the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>), who complained against God despite His provision. This behavior reflects a lack of faith and gratitude, which is condemned throughout Scripture. The discontentment suggests a deeper spiritual issue, as contentment is often associated with trust in God's sovereignty (<a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a>).<p><b>following after their own lusts</b><br>This indicates a self-centered lifestyle driven by personal desires rather than God's will. The phrase aligns with warnings against living according to the flesh (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-21</a>). Such behavior is often linked to moral decay and spiritual blindness, as seen in the days of Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>) and Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19). It highlights the danger of prioritizing earthly pleasures over spiritual truths.<p><b>their mouths spew arrogance</b><br>Arrogance in speech reveals a heart condition that is prideful and rebellious against God. This is reminiscent of the Pharisees, whom Jesus rebuked for their self-righteousness (<a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>). The Bible consistently warns against pride (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>), emphasizing humility as a virtue (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). Arrogant speech can lead to division and is contrary to the edifying communication encouraged in <a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>.<p><b>they flatter others for their own advantage</b><br>Flattery is insincere praise used to manipulate others for personal gain. This behavior is condemned in Scripture as deceitful and harmful (<a href="/proverbs/26-28.htm">Proverbs 26:28</a>). It contrasts with the biblical call to love and serve others selflessly (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>). The use of flattery for advantage reflects a lack of integrity and a focus on self-promotion, which is antithetical to the teachings of Christ, who exemplified humility and service (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jude.htm">Jude</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally understood to be Jude, the brother of James and half-brother of Jesus.

They find fault with God&#8217;s provision, His timing, and His people, echoing the wilderness generation that &#8220;grumbled against Moses and Aaron&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>). Scripture repeatedly warns against this spirit:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Do everything without complaining or arguing&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Nor should we grumble, as some of them did&#8212;and were killed by the destroying angel&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:10</a>).<p>Grumbling is not a harmless habit; it is rebellion in seed form. A grateful heart magnifies the Lord, but a murmuring heart magnifies self.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Following after their own lusts</b><p>Next, Jude observes that they are &#8220;following after their own lusts,&#8221; meaning personal cravings dictate their choices. Rather than submitting to God&#8217;s will, they bow to appetite. This mirrors the pattern in <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm">2 Peter 2:10</a>, where false teachers &#8220;follow the flesh in its corrupt desire,&#8221; and <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16&#8211;17</a>, which contrasts flesh against Spirit. <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a> outlines the tragic progression: desire &#8594; sin &#8594; death. When desires rule, truth is bent to accommodate them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their mouths spew arrogance</b><p>Jude continues: &#8220;their mouths spew arrogance.&#8221; The tongue exposes the heart, and these men&#8217;s speech overflows with pride. <a href="/psalms/12-4.htm">Psalm 12:4</a> records the boast, &#8220;With our tongues we will prevail.&#8221; <a href="/proverbs/6-17.htm">Proverbs 6:17</a> lists &#8220;haughty eyes&#8221; as an abomination, and <a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18</a> adds that false teachers &#8220;speak lofty but empty words.&#8221; The fruit of the Spirit includes humility; the fruit of the flesh includes swaggering self-promotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They flatter others for their own advantage</b><p>Finally, &#8220;they flatter others for their own advantage.&#8221; Flattery is counterfeit encouragement: praise with strings attached. <a href="/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a> warns that &#8220;by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive.&#8221; <a href="/proverbs/26-28.htm">Proverbs 26:28</a> says, &#8220;a flattering mouth works ruin,&#8221; and <a href="/daniel/11-32.htm">Daniel 11:32</a> shows flattery used to win allegiance. Their goal is influence, not edification; relationship becomes a tool for personal gain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jude/1-16.htm">Jude 1:16</a> sketches a sober profile of false teachers: chronic complainers driven by desire, boasting from proud hearts, and using flattery as a lever. Their lives stand in stark contrast to the Spirit-filled life marked by gratitude, self-control, humility, and sincere love. Recognizing these traits helps the church remain anchored in the truth that God&#8217;s Word is both accurate and sufficient for discerning character and doctrine today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jude/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - As in <a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18, 19</a>, the men are further stigmatized for the gross and profane selfishness to which they gave vent in speech. The present verse enlarges on the particular vice which the writer adds to the more general statement given in the Book of Enoch - the vice of uttering hard things against God. <span class="cmt_word">These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.</span> The words rendered "murmurers" and "complainers" occur nowhere else in the New Testament. It is doubtful whether any clear distinction can be drawn between them, except that the former term is the more general, and the latter the more specific, expressing one particular direction which the murmuring spirit takes, namely, that of discontent with their circumstances (so Huther, etc.). The clause, "walking after their own lusts," then declares the secret cause of their discontent. They made themselves, their own notions of things, their own ambitions and appetites, the one rule of their life. They therefore judged the lot which was assigned them by God unworthy of them and railed against it. We may gather from the parallel passage in 2 Peter that they forswore in especial the restraints put upon them by the providence or by the grace of God, and asserted a liberty which meant unbridled self-indulgence. The arrogant selfishness which refused to be fettered by Divine law naturally expressed itself also in "great swelling words," in loud protestations, perhaps, that nothing should interfere with their liberty. The phrase (which in the New Testament occurs again only in <a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18</a>) is the same as is rendered "speak marvelous things" in Daniel's description of the king who "shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods," etc. (<a href="/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36, 37</a>). In the last clause we have a phrase similar to, but not quite the same as, the one which usually expresses the idea of having respect of persons. The Authorized Version, therefore, seems to do better than the Revised Version here in adopting a rendering which indicates that there is some difference from the usual form. The point of this difference may be that Jude's phrase expresses not merely the partial and unprincipled conduct which is one thing to the poor and another to the rich, but the open and unconcealed adulation with which these men hung upon those to whom it might be of advantage to attach themselves. The proud repudiation of the submission which was due to God and the Divine disposal of their lot was accompanied by a cringing, unblushing submission of their manhood to those of their fellow-men who had favours to bestow.
