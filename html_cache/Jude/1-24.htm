The concept of God keeping believers from stumbling is rooted in the assurance of divine protection and guidance. In the Old Testament, <a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3</a> states, "He will not let your foot slip&#8212;He who watches over you will not slumber." This reflects the idea that God is actively involved in the lives of believers, ensuring their spiritual stability. The imagery of stumbling is often used in Scripture to denote falling into sin or error, and this assurance is a promise of God's sustaining grace.<p><b>and to present you unblemished</b><br>The term "unblemished" is significant in biblical theology, often associated with the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where offerings to God had to be without defect (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>). This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described as the "Lamb without blemish or defect" (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). In the New Testament context, being presented unblemished refers to the sanctifying work of Christ, who purifies believers and prepares them for eternal life. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>, where the church is presented to Christ as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle.<p><b>in His glorious presence</b><br>The phrase "His glorious presence" points to the eschatological hope of believers being in the presence of God. This is a theme throughout Scripture, where the ultimate goal of salvation is to dwell with God eternally. In <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>, it is declared, "Now the dwelling of God is with men, and He will live with them." The glory of God's presence is a recurring theme, representing His holiness, majesty, and the fulfillment of His promises. The presence of God is often associated with light and glory, as seen in the transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>).<p><b>with great joy&#8212;</b><br>The culmination of being kept from stumbling and presented unblemished is marked by "great joy." This joy is not merely an emotional response but a profound state of being that results from the assurance of salvation and the fulfillment of God's promises. In the biblical narrative, joy is often linked to the presence of God and the realization of His kingdom (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>). The joy mentioned here is eschatological, looking forward to the ultimate joy of eternal life with God, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>, where the marriage of the Lamb is celebrated with rejoicing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jude.htm">Jude</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally understood to be Jude, the brother of James and half-brother of Jesus.

The verse anchors assurance not in human effort but in the unshakable ability and promise of the living God, assuring believers that the journey He began, He will unfailingly complete.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jude/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24, 25) Concluding Doxology.<p>(24) <span class= "bld">Now unto him that is able.</span>--Comp. the conclusion <a href="/romans/16-25.htm" title2="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>. It would be rash to infer from the similarity that St. Jude must have known the Epistle to the Romans; although there is nothing incredible in the supposition that he was acquainted with it. The Epistle had been in circulation probably for some ten years before St. Jude wrote. Doxologies no doubt became elastic formulas almost from the first.<p><span class= "bld">To keep you from falling.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to keep you unfallen.</span> From his own warnings, denunciations, and exhortations, which have been severe and sombre throughout, St. Jude turns in joyous, exulting confidence to Him who alone can make them effectual.

He has also set before them the attitude they ought to adopt toward different classes, and has not concealed the peril to themselves which the discharge of Christian duty to others may involve. Recognizing how short the way is that brotherly counsel or personal effort can carry one in these solemn and arduous obligations, he now reminds his readers of a higher power that is available for their help and protection, and commends them to that as their best, their only security. The risk of <span class="accented">falling</span> or <span class="accented">stumbling</span>, as it rather means, is great. Only the omnipotence of God can "keep" them from it or <span class="accented">protect</span> them against it, the word for "keeping" being one which expresses the idea of "guarding." <span class="cmt_word">And to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.</span> The terms here again arc exceedingly vivid, the one which is rendered "present" meaning to "set one up" or "make one stand," and the "faultless" being the adjective "without blemish" which is applied to the Levitical offerings in the Old Testament, and to Christ himself in <a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>. The "glory" here in view is that of the last day, when he to whom all judgment is committed returns to execute that judgment in his own glory and that of his Father (<a href="/luke/9-26.htm">Luke 9:26</a>; <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>). The "exceeding joy" expresses the feeling with which it shall be given to the faithful to meet that day. The Revised Version, therefore, more correctly renders it, "And to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish in exceeding joy." Weak and vulnerable as they are, God's grace is mighty to do these two things for them - to protect them through time, and at the end of time to make them stand the scrutiny of the Judge like men in whom no blemish is discovered, and to whom that day brings exultant joy. <span class="cmt_word">To the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and power, before all time, and now, and for evermore</span> (or, <span class="accented">unto all the ages</span>). So the Revised Version renders it, in accordance with the best-authenticated text. Documentary evidence renders it necessary to omit the "wise" in the "only wise God" of the Authorized Version, to insert the clause, "through our Lord Jesus Christ," to omit the "and" before the "majesty," and to adopt the extended expression of duration in the closing sentence. Thus the largest possible ascription of praise is made to God. It is the ascription of an honour which is confessed to belong to him eternally, before the world was, as well as in the present, and on to the eternity which is yet to enter.
