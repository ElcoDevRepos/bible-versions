The term "partner" (Greek: koin&#333;nos) implies a deep fellowship and mutual participation in the work of Christ. This reflects the early Christian understanding of community, where believers were seen as co-laborers in spreading the gospel. The concept of partnership is also seen in <a href="/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>, where Paul thanks the Philippians for their partnership in the gospel.<p><b>receive him</b><br>Paul is referring to Onesimus, a runaway slave who has become a Christian. The act of receiving Onesimus back is not just a physical acceptance but a spiritual and relational one, emphasizing forgiveness and reconciliation. This reflects the transformative power of the gospel, which breaks down social barriers and calls for a new way of relating to one another, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>.<p><b>as you would receive me</b><br>Paul equates Onesimus with himself, urging Philemon to treat Onesimus with the same respect and love he would show to Paul. This is a radical request in the context of Roman society, where slaves had little to no rights. It underscores the Christian principle of equality before God, as highlighted in <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>. This phrase also typifies Christ's advocacy for believers, as Jesus intercedes on behalf of humanity, asking the Father to receive us as He would His own Son.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to Philemon.

Because Paul and Philemon share true fellowship in Christ, Philemon must welcome Onesimus without reserve, granting him the same honor he would give the apostle. The verse teaches that Christian unity overrides social status, forgiveness mirrors God&#8217;s grace, and believers extend to one another the very reception they would give to Jesus Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/philemon/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">A partner.</span>--The title is peculiar. In the singular number (in which it is naturally more distinctive) and in absolute use, unconnected with explanatory words (such as we read in <a href="/1_peter/5-1.htm" title="The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:">1Peter 5:1</a>), it is nowhere else found, except in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-23.htm" title="Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.">2Corinthians 8:23</a>, where Titus is called St. Paul's "partner and fellow helper;" and even there the context defines the partnership as relating to the collection and ministration of alms. Here it can hardly refer to general Christian fellowship, which would require some such words as "in Christ," or "in the Spirit," and would not fully justify the strong personal appeal of the passage. It must indicate some peculiar bond of fellowship between St. Paul and Philemon. Philemon was his convert (see <a href="/philemon/1-19.htm" title="I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to you how you owe to me even your own self besides.">Philemon 1:19</a>); yet we notice that he writes to him not as a son, but as a brother. Evidently he was a leader in the Church at Colossae. Tradition, as usual, makes him its bishop. He must have been St. Paul's partner in some common work or special communion of familiarity.
