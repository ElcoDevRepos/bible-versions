The use of "perhaps" suggests humility in discerning God's will, acknowledging that human understanding is limited. This reflects the biblical theme that God can work through circumstances that seem negative or unintended, as seen in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>, where Joseph tells his brothers that what they intended for harm, God intended for good.<p><b>he was separated from you</b><br>The separation refers to Onesimus, a slave who had run away from his master, Philemon. In the Roman world, slavery was a common institution, and a runaway slave could face severe punishment. This separation, though seemingly a negative event, is presented as part of a larger divine plan. The concept of separation leading to a greater purpose is echoed in the story of Moses, who was separated from his people for a time before leading them to freedom.<p><b>for a while</b><br>This indicates a temporary situation, suggesting that the separation was not meant to be permanent. The temporary nature of trials is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>, which speaks of "light and momentary troubles" achieving an eternal glory. It emphasizes the transient nature of earthly struggles in contrast to eternal outcomes.<p><b>so that you might have him back</b><br>The return of Onesimus is not just a physical return but a transformation. Onesimus is returning not merely as a slave but as a brother in Christ. This reflects the transformative power of the Gospel, which changes relationships and social structures. The reconciliation between Philemon and Onesimus is a microcosm of the reconciliation between God and humanity through Christ.<p><b>for good&#8212;</b><br>This phrase implies a permanent and positive change. The Greek word used here can mean both "forever" and "better," suggesting both a lasting relationship and an improved one. This echoes the eternal nature of the new covenant in Christ, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>, where Christ is the mediator of a new covenant that is eternal. The transformation of Onesimus from a slave to a beloved brother is a type of the believer's transformation in Christ, from bondage to sin to freedom and eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philemon.htm">Philemon</a></b><br>A Christian leader in Colossae, likely a wealthy man who hosted a house church.

St. Paul now touches on Onesimus' "being parted" from Philemon, using a phrase not only (as has been noted) euphemistic, but also one which suggested that his running away was, however unconsciously, overruled by a higher hand. God, in His wisdom, "parted" him from Philemon "for a season, that he might receive him for ever." The phrase "for ever" is the word always used for "eternal." The contrast with "for a season" might be satisfied here by the merely relative sense of "perpetual" or "life-long service;" but, considering that the phrase is used in direct reference to the brotherhood of the Communion of Saints, it is better to take it in its absolute sense, of fellowship in the life eternal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philemon/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>; for this purpose (final cause). <span class="cmt_word">Departed for a season.</span> He was therefore parted from thee for a time (Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Forever</span>; everlastingly (accusative, not an adverb). The relation of master and slave would have been in any case, and would still be, terminated by death. But it was now replaced by a new relation of Christian brotherhood, which would be permanent - a great advantage. So Calvin, Grotius, and many others. Meyer's objection does not seem of much weight (compare the <span class="accented">Perpetua mancipia</span> of <a href="/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-17.htm">Deuteronomy 15:17</a>).
