In the context of the letter to Philemon, Paul is addressing the issue of Onesimus, a runaway slave who has become a Christian. By seeking Philemon's consent, Paul respects the social and legal norms of the time, which required the master's approval for any change in a slave's status. This approach reflects the biblical principle of mutual respect and love among believers, as seen in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>, where Jesus teaches about resolving conflicts within the church community.<p><b>so that your goodness will not be out of compulsion</b><br>Paul desires that Philemon's actions be motivated by genuine love and goodness rather than obligation. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God values the heart's intentions over mere external compliance, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where Paul writes about giving cheerfully rather than reluctantly. The cultural context of the Roman world often involved hierarchical relationships, but Paul encourages a transformation of these relationships through the lens of Christian love and freedom.<p><b>but by your own free will</b><br>The concept of free will is central to Christian theology, emphasizing that true goodness and love must be chosen rather than forced. This aligns with the biblical narrative of God granting humans free will, as seen in the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis. Paul's appeal to Philemon highlights the transformative power of the Gospel, which calls believers to act out of love and conviction rather than societal pressure or legal obligation. This principle is echoed in <a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>, where Paul urges believers to use their freedom to serve one another in love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to Philemon.
