It underscores the authority and continuity of God's Word. The phrase suggests that the following statement is a fulfillment or reflection of biblical truth, often used by New Testament writers to connect their teachings with the Hebrew Scriptures.<p><b>&#8220;He has scattered abroad His gifts to the poor;</b><br>This part of the verse is a quotation from <a href="/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a>, which describes the righteous man who is generous and compassionate. The imagery of scattering suggests a liberal and abundant distribution, reflecting God's own generosity. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, almsgiving was a significant act of piety and social responsibility. The act of giving to the poor is seen as a reflection of God's character, who provides for all His creation. This scattering of gifts can also be seen as a type of Christ, who gave Himself for humanity.<p><b>His righteousness endures forever.&#8221;</b><br>The enduring nature of righteousness here implies that acts of generosity have eternal significance. In biblical theology, righteousness is not just a moral quality but a relational one, involving right relationships with God and others. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme that true righteousness is demonstrated through justice and mercy. The eternal aspect of righteousness points to the everlasting nature of God's covenant faithfulness, as well as the eternal rewards for those who live righteously. This enduring righteousness is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, whose life and sacrifice provide the ultimate example of enduring righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, writing to the church in Corinth to encourage generosity and stewardship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and dynamic early Christian community in the city of Corinth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>The recipients of the gifts mentioned in the verse, representing those in need within the Christian community and beyond.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The original author of the quote, which is from <a href="/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a>, emphasizing the enduring nature of righteousness and generosity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate source of righteousness and the one who empowers believers to give generously.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_generosity.htm">The Principle of Generosity</a></b><br>Believers are called to be generous, scattering their resources to help those in need.

At first it might almost seem as if they were quoted in a different sense from the original, and applied, not to the giver of alms, but to God as the giver of all good, dispersing His bounty and showing His righteousness. There are, however, sufficient grounds for taking them in their true meaning here also. "The good man gives to the poor," the Psalmist had said; "but he is not impoverished by his gifts.
