Paul had expectations based on their previous actions and the grace of God working in them. This phrase highlights the surprise and gratitude Paul felt for their actions, which exceeded his expectations. The Macedonians' actions serve as a model of Christian giving, emphasizing that true generosity often surpasses human expectations.<p><b>but they gave themselves first to the Lord</b><br>This phrase underscores the priority of spiritual commitment over material giving. The Macedonians' first act was to dedicate themselves to God, reflecting the biblical principle that true giving stems from a heart surrendered to the Lord. This mirrors the call in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a> to present our bodies as living sacrifices. Their dedication to God was the foundation for their generosity, illustrating that genuine Christian service and giving are rooted in a personal relationship with Christ.<p><b>and then to us</b><br>After committing themselves to the Lord, the Macedonians extended their dedication to Paul and his companions. This reflects the early Christian community's interconnectedness and mutual support, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>. Their support for Paul was not just financial but also relational, indicating a deep partnership in the gospel. This aligns with the biblical teaching that love for God naturally extends to love for others, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20-21</a>.<p><b>through the will of God</b><br>The phrase indicates that their actions were in accordance with God's divine plan and purpose. It suggests that their generosity was not merely a human decision but was inspired and guided by the Holy Spirit. This aligns with the biblical theme that God works through His people to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>.
