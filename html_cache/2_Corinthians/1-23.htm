This practice is consistent with Jewish tradition, where oaths were made in God's name to confirm honesty (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>). It underscores Paul's integrity and the gravity of his message, as he seeks to assure the Corinthians of his sincerity and the divine authority behind his actions.<p><b>that it was in order to spare you</b><br>Paul's decision not to return to Corinth was motivated by a desire to spare the Corinthians from a severe rebuke. This reflects his pastoral heart and concern for their spiritual well-being. The context suggests that his previous visit had been painful due to issues within the church (<a href="/2_corinthians/2.htm">2 Corinthians 2:1</a>). By delaying his return, Paul hoped to give them time to address these issues, demonstrating his patience and love.<p><b>that I did not return to Corinth</b><br>Corinth was a major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and moral challenges. The church there faced significant internal strife and external pressures. Paul's decision not to return immediately was strategic, allowing the church time to resolve conflicts and grow spiritually. This decision aligns with his broader mission strategy, as seen in Acts, where he often revisited churches to strengthen them (<a href="/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36</a>). His absence was not neglect but a deliberate choice to foster maturity and repentance among the believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians.

In <a href="/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a> and <a href="/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a> he uses the same kind of oath, underscoring that what follows is absolutely true before the God who &#8220;cannot lie&#8221; (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase assures the Corinthians&#8212;and us&#8212;that Paul&#8217;s motives and decisions are transparent and accountable to God, reflecting <a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>&#8217;s command not to misuse His name.<p>&#8226; By invoking God, Paul also models integrity for believers, echoing Jesus&#8217; call to let &#8220;your &#8216;Yes&#8217; be yes and your &#8216;No,&#8217; no&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in order to spare you</b><p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s restraint is pastoral, not self-protective. He desires their spiritual well-being, mirroring his heart in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-1.htm">2 Corinthians 2:1&#8211;4</a>, where he explains he postponed a visit to avoid causing &#8220;another painful visit.&#8221;<p>&#8226; He is prepared to confront sin, yet prefers repentance over discipline, resonating with <a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>: &#8220;Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and with a gentle spirit?&#8221;<p>&#8226; The goal is always edification (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-10.htm">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>). Delaying the trip gives them space to respond to his earlier letter, sparing them the sorrow of severe correction (see <a href="/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; This reflects the Lord&#8217;s own patience, &#8220;not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I did not return to Corinth</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/acts/18.htm">Acts 18</a> records Paul&#8217;s founding visit; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5</a> shows he had planned another.

By postponing his visit he spared the Corinthians a stern confrontation, granting time for repentance and preserving their joy. The verse reveals a shepherd&#8217;s heart guided by truth, patience, and accountability to God&#8212;an example for every believer who seeks to act in genuine, sacrificial love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">I call God for a record.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">I call upon</span> <span class= "ital">God as a witness against my soul.</span> The thought seems to come across St. Paul's mind that the Corinthians will require a more specific explanation of his change of plan, and he finds this in what had been in part suggested in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1Corinthians 4:21</a>.

At this point, to <a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>, he enters for the first time on the kindly reasons which had led him to forego his intended earlier visit. He uses a similar adjuration in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>; and although these appeals (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>; <a href="/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-20.htm">Galatians 1:20</a>) may be due in part to the emotional fervour of his temperament, yet he would hardly have resorted to them in this self defence, if the calumnies of his enemies had not gained much credence. The French proverb, <span class="accented">Qui s'excuse s'accuse</span>, is often grossly abused. The refutation of lies and slanders is often a duty, not because they injure us, but because, by diminishing our usefulness, they may injure others. <span class="cmt_word">Upon my soul.</span> Not "to take vengeance on my soul if I lie," but to confirm the appeal of its honesty and integrity. By the use of such "oaths for confirmation," St. Paul, no less than other apostles, shows that he understood our Lord's rule, "Let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay," as applying to the principle of simple and unvarnished truthfulness of intercourse, which requires no further confirmation; but not as a rigid exclusion of the right to appeal to God in solemn cases and for good reasons. <span class="cmt_word">To spare you.</span> This postponement of the intended visit was a sign of .<span class="accented">forbearance</span>, for which they should have been grateful. After all that he had heard of <span class="accented">them</span>, if he had come at all, it could only have been "with a rod" (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I came not as yet.</span> The rendering is erroneous.
