In the New Testament context, this fear is not about terror but about a reverent awe that leads to obedience and worship. Paul, having experienced the transformative power of Christ, understands the gravity of God's holiness and justice, which compels him to live and preach with sincerity and urgency.<p><b>we try to persuade men</b><br>Paul's mission was to spread the Gospel, and persuasion was a key element of his ministry. This persuasion is not manipulation but a heartfelt appeal to others to accept the truth of Christ. <a href="/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2-4</a> shows Paul reasoning with Jews and Greeks, using Scripture to explain and prove that Jesus is the Messiah. The cultural context of Corinth, a city known for its diverse beliefs and philosophies, required Paul to engage thoughtfully and persuasively with his audience, presenting the Gospel as the ultimate truth.<p><b>What we are is clear to God</b><br>Paul emphasizes his transparency before God, who knows the true intentions of the heart. This echoes <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances. Paul&#8217;s confidence in his integrity before God is a testament to his genuine commitment to the Gospel. This assurance is crucial in a time when false apostles were questioning his authority and motives.<p><b>and I hope it is clear to your conscience as well</b><br>Paul appeals to the Corinthians' conscience, hoping they recognize his sincerity and the truth of his message. The conscience, as discussed in <a href="/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>, acts as an internal witness to one's actions and intentions. Paul desires that the Corinthians, through their own spiritual discernment, see the authenticity of his ministry. This appeal to conscience is significant in a culture where public opinion and reputation were highly valued, and it underscores the importance of personal integrity and accountability in the Christian life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

Tyndale's and Cranmer's versions give, "how the Lord is to be feared;" the Rhemish, "fear." "Terror," characteristically enough, makes its first appearance in the Geneva version.<p><span class= "bld">We persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God.</span>--The antithesis is singularly indicative of the rapid turn of thought in the Apostle's mind. "<span class= "ital">We go on our way of winning men</span> to Christ." (Comp. the use of the same Greek word in <a href="/acts/12-20.htm" title="And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.">Acts 12:20</a>, "having made Blastus . . . their friend.") It is singular to note that, in an Epistle probably nearly contemporary with this, St. Paul uses the phrase almost in a bad sense: "Do we now persuade men, or God?" <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "Are we seeking to please our friends or God?" (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a>.) And here, apparently, the imperfection of the phrase and its liability to misconstruction occurs to him, and he therefore immediately adds, "Yes, we do our work of persuading men" (the case of Felix, in <a href="/acts/24-25.htm" title="And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go your way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for you.">Acts 24:25</a>, may be noted as showing the prominence of "the judgment to come" in St. Paul's method), "but it is all along with the thought that our own lives also have been laid open in their inmost recesses to the sight of God." The word "made manifest" is clearly used in reference to the same word (in the Greek) as is translated "appear" in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2Corinthians 5:10</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-19.</span> <span class="accented">- Self-devotion of the ministry of reconciliation</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.</span> Multitudes of texts have been torn from their context and grossly abused and misinterpreted, but few more so than this. It is the text usually chosen by those who wish to excuse a setting forth of God under the attributes of Moloch. With any such views it has not the remotest connection. It simply means, "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men," either "to keep in view the same fear of the Lord as ourselves," or (reverting to his last assertion of his own sincerity and integrity in ver. 9), "that our sole ambition is to please God." The rendering, "the terror of the Lord," for the every day expression, "the fear of the Lord," was wantonly intruded into modern versions by Beza, and has not a single word to be said in its favour. The phrase means (as always) not the dread which God inspires, but the holy fear which mingles with our love of him. To teach men to regard God with terror is to undo the best teaching of all Scripture, which indeed has too often been the main end of human systems of theology. <span class="accented">We persuade men</span>. Not in a bad sense (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). The attacks and calumnies of enemies make it necessary to vindicate our integrity is men; but we have no need to do so to God, because he already knows us (comp.
