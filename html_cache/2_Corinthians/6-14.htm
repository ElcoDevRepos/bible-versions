In the Old Testament, <a href="/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a> prohibits yoking an ox and a donkey together, highlighting the importance of pairing like with like for effective work. Spiritually, this metaphor warns against forming binding relationships, such as marriage or business partnerships, with those who do not share the Christian faith. The principle is rooted in the idea that believers and unbelievers have fundamentally different values and worldviews, which can lead to conflict and compromise of one's faith. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of separation from sin and dedication to God, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a> and <a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>.<p><b>For what partnership can righteousness have with wickedness?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the incompatibility between a life lived according to God's standards (righteousness) and one characterized by sin (wickedness). The Bible consistently contrasts these two paths, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a>, which describes the blessedness of the righteous and the downfall of the wicked. The concept of righteousness is central to the Christian faith, reflecting God's character and His expectations for His people. In the New Testament, believers are called to pursue righteousness through faith in Christ (<a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>), while wickedness is associated with rebellion against God and His laws. This dichotomy underscores the need for believers to maintain purity and integrity in their relationships and interactions.<p><b>Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?</b><br>Light and darkness are powerful biblical symbols representing good and evil, truth and falsehood, God and Satan. In <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, Jesus declares Himself the "light of the world," signifying His role in revealing truth and guiding believers. Darkness, conversely, is often associated with ignorance, sin, and separation from God (<a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8-11</a>). The imagery of light and darkness is used throughout Scripture to illustrate the transformative power of the gospel, which calls believers out of darkness into God's marvelous light (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). This phrase reinforces the idea that believers, as children of light, should not engage in practices or relationships that align with the darkness of unbelief and sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, writing to the church in Corinth to provide guidance and instruction on living a Christian life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece known for its wealth and moral decadence, where the early church faced challenges in maintaining Christian values amidst a pagan culture.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers_and_unbelievers.htm">Believers and Unbelievers</a></b><br>The primary groups addressed in this passage, highlighting the distinction between those who follow Christ and those who do not.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteousness_and_wickedness.htm">Righteousness and Wickedness</a></b><br>Concepts representing the moral and spiritual dichotomy between living according to God's standards and living in sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/light_and_darkness.htm">Light and Darkness</a></b><br>Metaphors used throughout Scripture to symbolize truth and falsehood, purity and sin, and the presence of God versus the absence of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_yoke_metaphor.htm">Understanding the Yoke Metaphor</a></b><br>The yoke was a wooden beam used to pair animals for plowing.

Remaining single-yoked with Christ keeps the walk steady, the testimony clear, and the heart at rest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.</span>--We seem at first to enter, by an abrupt transition, upon a new line of exhortation. The under-current of thought is, however, not difficult to trace. There was a false latitude as well as a true. The baser party at Corinth might think it a matter of indifference whether they married a heathen or a Christian, whether they chose their intimate friends among the worshippers of Aphrodite or of Christ. Against that "enlargement" the Apostle feels bound to protest. The Greek word for "unequally yoked together" is not found elsewhere, and was probably coined by St. Paul to give expression to his thoughts. Its meaning is, however, determined by the use of the cognate noun in <a href="/leviticus/19-19.htm" title="You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your cattle engender with a diverse kind: you shall not sow your field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woolen come on you.">Leviticus 19:19</a> ("Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with <span class= "ital">a diverse kind</span>"). Cattle were unequally yoked together when ox and ass were drawing the same plough (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-10.htm" title="You shall not plow with an ox and an ass together.">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>). Men and women are so when they have no common bond of faith in God. Another explanation refers the image to the yoke of a balance, or pair of scales, and so sees in the precept a warning against partiality in judgment; but this rests on very slender ground, or rather, no ground at all.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.</span> Ewald, followed by Dean Stanley, Holsten, and others, thinks that here there is a sudden dislocation of the argument, and some have even supposed that the section, <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1</a>, is either an after thought written by the apostle on the margin of the Epistle after it was finished; or even an interpolation. The latter view has arisen from the unusual expressions of the section, and the use of the word "Belial," and the command of Greek shown by the varied expressions. There is no adequate ground for these conjectures. Every writer is conscious of moods in which words come to him more fluently than at other times, and all writers of deep feeling, like St. Paul, abound in sudden transitions which correspond to the lightning-like rapidity of their thoughts. It is doubtful whether the readers would not have seen at once the sequence of thought, which depends on circumstances which we can only conjecture. Probably the alienation from St. Paul had its root in some tampering with unbelievers. Such might at any rate have been the case among the Gentile members of the Church, some of whom were even willing to go to sacrificial feasts in heathen temples (<a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8-10</a>.). "Unequally yoked" is a metaphor derived from <a href="/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>, and is the opposite of "<span class="accented">true yoke fellow"</span> (<a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What fellowship;</span> literally, <span class="accented">participation</span> (<a href="/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6-11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unrighteousness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">lawlessness</span> (<a href="/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>).
