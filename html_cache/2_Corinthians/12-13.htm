This reflects the broader context of 2 Corinthians, where Paul defends his apostleship and ministry. The Corinthian church was rich in spiritual gifts (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>), and Paul had invested significant time and effort in their spiritual growth. This rhetorical question highlights that their spiritual experience and access to apostolic teaching were on par with other early Christian communities.<p><b>except that I was not a burden to you?</b><br>Paul did not accept financial support from the Corinthians, unlike his approach with other churches (<a href="/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15-16</a>). This decision was to avoid any accusations of greed or exploitation, as false apostles were a concern (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13-15</a>). In the Greco-Roman world, patronage was common, and refusing support could be seen as a lack of relationship or trust. However, Paul&#8217;s intent was to demonstrate his sincerity and to ensure that the gospel was offered freely, without any financial obligation.<p><b>Forgive me this wrong!</b><br>This statement is ironic and highlights Paul's deep concern for the Corinthians' perception of his ministry. By asking for forgiveness, Paul underscores the absurdity of considering his refusal of financial support as a wrongdoing. This irony serves to challenge the Corinthians to reconsider their values and expectations of leadership. It also reflects Paul's pastoral heart, as he seeks to mend any misunderstandings and maintain unity within the church. This phrase connects to the broader theme of sacrificial love and service, as exemplified by Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the church in Corinth.

Paul opens with a rhetorical question, inviting the Corinthians to consider whether they truly lacked anything other congregations enjoyed (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-5.htm">2 Corinthians 11:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; He has already reminded them they received:<p>&#8211; The same gospel that saved the Galatians and Ephesians (<a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>).<p>&#8211; The same signs, wonders, and miracles that authenticated his apostleship everywhere he went (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>; <a href="/acts/14-3.htm">Acts 14:3</a>).<p>&#8211; The same pastoral love and correction given to the Philippians and Thessalonians (<a href="/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; So, in truth, they were &#8220;inferior&#8221; in no way; any sense of deficiency came from their own attitudes, not from Paul&#8217;s ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>except that I was not a burden to you?</b><p>&#8226; This clause pinpoints the only &#8220;difference&#8221;: Paul refused to accept financial support from Corinth during his stay (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-7.htm">2 Corinthians 11:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; He labored at tent-making (<a href="/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1&#8211;3</a>) and received aid from Macedonia (<a href="/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15&#8211;16</a>), so the gospel could be offered to the Corinthians &#8220;free of charge&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-18.htm">1 Corinthians 9:18</a>).<p>&#8226; His motive was to:<p>&#8211; Model self-sacrifice and avoid any hint of greed (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>).<p>&#8211; Undermine the claims of false apostles who charged hefty fees (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-12.htm">2 Corinthians 11:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8211; Remove obstacles that might prevent the Corinthians from embracing Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; Ironically, some took his generosity as evidence he lacked apostolic authority, prompting this clarifying statement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Forgive me this wrong!</b><p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s closing irony exposes the absurdity of their complaint; he asks pardon for a &#8220;wrong&#8221; that was actually a kindness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-16.htm">2 Corinthians 12:16&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; His words drip with loving sarcasm, yet they also invite genuine reflection:<p>&#8211; If they felt slighted by his refusal of support, they should extend grace, just as Christ forgave them (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>).<p>&#8211; If they doubted his motives, they should recall his consistent pattern of self-denial for their spiritual good (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-3.htm">2 Corinthians 6:3&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The appeal underscores Paul&#8217;s father-heart&#8212;willing to be misunderstood if only his spiritual children stand firm in the faith (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s tongue-in-cheek apology highlights a single &#8220;difference&#8221; between Corinth and other churches: he never accepted their money. Far from cheating them, he protected them from stumbling and proved his sincere, Christ-like love. The verse calls readers to recognize faithful ministry not by financial arrangements but by the uncompromised gospel, authentic spiritual power, and self-sacrificing care that mirror the heart of Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">What is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches?</span>--His mind travels back to the insinuation that he cared less for them than he did for the churches of Macedonia, because he had maintained his independence and had received no gifts from them. If they complained of this, they should, at least, remember that this was the only point of inferiority. They had experienced fully all the advantages that flowed from his special power as an Apostle. For that wrong, so far as it was a wrong, he asks their forgiveness.<p><span class= "bld">That I myself was not burdensome.</span>--He uses here, and in the next verse, the same characteristic word for "sponging" on them, which has been commented on in the Note on <a href="/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2Corinthians 11:9</a>.
