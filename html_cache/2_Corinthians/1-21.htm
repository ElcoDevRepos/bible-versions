The term "establishes" suggests a firm foundation, indicating that God is the one who provides stability and security in the faith. This reflects the biblical theme of God as the foundation of believers' lives, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a> and <a href="/1_peter/5-10.htm">1 Peter 5:10</a>. The inclusion of "both us and you" highlights the unity between Paul, his companions, and the Corinthian believers, underscoring the communal aspect of faith. The phrase "in Christ" is central to Pauline theology, signifying the believer's union with Jesus, which is a recurring theme in Paul's letters (e.g., <a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). This union is not just positional but also relational, affecting every aspect of the believer's life.<p><b>He anointed us,</b><br>The concept of anointing in the Bible often signifies being set apart for a specific purpose or role, as seen in the anointing of kings and priests in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>, <a href="/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>). In the New Testament, anointing is associated with the Holy Spirit's work in believers' lives (1 <a href="/john/2-20.htm">John 2:20, 27</a>). This anointing empowers and equips Christians for service and ministry, reflecting the anointing of Jesus Himself, who was anointed by the Spirit for His earthly ministry (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). The use of "us" indicates that this anointing is not limited to Paul and his companions but extends to all believers, signifying their participation in God's mission and their empowerment by the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate source of stability and anointing for believers.

Any sense of stability, security, or permanence in the Christian life flows from Him alone. The word &#8220;establishes&#8221; carries the idea of setting something firmly in place so it cannot be shaken.<p>&#8226; Notice the inclusiveness&#8212;&#8220;both us and you.&#8221; The same God who steadied Paul and his ministry team is also strengthening the Corinthian believers. Our footing in Christ is not a tiered system; every believer, whether apostle or new convert, stands on the same solid foundation (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Being &#8220;in Christ&#8221; is more than a label; it is a positional reality. <a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a> reminds us, &#8220;For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God&#8221;. That hiddenness underscores why nothing and no one can ultimately move us off the footing God has provided (<a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38-39</a>).<p>&#8226; God Himself personally ensures this stability. <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a> echoes the same assurance: &#8220;He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus&#8221;. Our perseverance rests on His promise, not on our performance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He anointed us</b><p>&#8226; In Scripture, anointing signifies being set apart and empowered for divine purpose. Just as Old Testament priests, prophets, and kings were anointed to serve (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), so every believer receives a spiritual anointing in Christ (<a href="/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>).<p>&#8226; This anointing is not a vague spiritual feeling; it is the work of the Holy Spirit, equipping us to live and serve under God&#8217;s authority (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The same Spirit who anointed Jesus for His earthly ministry (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>) now indwells us.<p>&#8226; The anointing carries both privilege and responsibility:<p>&#8211; Privilege: We have direct access to God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p>&#8211; Responsibility: We are empowered to witness, love, and persevere in truth (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Because God is the One who anoints, no human circumstance can revoke or diminish that calling (<a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>). Our confidence does not come from titles or outward success but from God&#8217;s irrevocable act of setting us apart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God Himself plants us securely in Christ and then equips us through His Spirit. Our footing and our function, our stability and our service, come from Him alone. The verse assures us that the One who firmly establishes us also faithfully anoints us, guaranteeing that we have everything needed to stand strong and serve well until we see Him face-to-face.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">He which stablisheth us with you . . .</span>--For a moment the thought of an <span class= "ital">apology</span> for his own conduct is merged in the higher thought of the greatness of his mission.
