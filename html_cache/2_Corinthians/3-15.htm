The Apostle Paul is writing to the Corinthians in the first century, but he refers to a condition that persists among the Jewish people. The phrase suggests continuity from the time of Moses to Paul's present day, highlighting the enduring nature of spiritual blindness.<p><b>when Moses is read</b><br>"Moses" here refers to the writings of Moses, particularly the Torah or the first five books of the Old Testament. These texts were central to Jewish worship and were read regularly in synagogues. The reading of Moses signifies adherence to the Old Covenant, which was given through Moses on Mount Sinai. This practice is deeply rooted in Jewish tradition and is a key part of their religious identity.<p><b>a veil covers their hearts</b><br>The "veil" is a metaphor for spiritual blindness or a lack of understanding. In the context of <a href="/2_corinthians/3.htm">2 Corinthians 3</a>, Paul contrasts the Old Covenant, represented by Moses and the law, with the New Covenant in Christ. The veil symbolizes the inability to see the full glory of God, which is revealed in Jesus Christ. This imagery is drawn from <a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>, where Moses wore a veil to cover his face after speaking with God, as the Israelites could not bear to look at the radiance. Paul uses this metaphor to explain that, without Christ, there is a barrier to understanding the true meaning and fulfillment of the Scriptures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses is the prophet through whom God delivered the Law to the Israelites.
