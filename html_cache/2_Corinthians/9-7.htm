In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the collection for the saints in Jerusalem, highlighting the importance of voluntary and heartfelt contributions. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. This aligns with the Old Testament principle found in <a href="/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a>, where God instructs Moses to collect offerings from those whose hearts prompt them to give. The decision to give should be a deliberate act, reflecting one's relationship with God and understanding of stewardship.<p><b>not out of regret or compulsion</b><br>Paul contrasts the ideal of voluntary giving with giving that is done reluctantly or under pressure. Regret implies a sense of loss or sorrow after giving, which can occur if the act is not done willingly. Compulsion suggests external pressure or obligation, which can lead to resentment. In the cultural context of Corinth, where patronage and social status were significant, giving could be manipulated for personal gain or social standing. Paul encourages believers to rise above these societal norms and give freely, as seen in the example of the Macedonian churches in <a href="/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1-5</a>, who gave generously despite their poverty.<p><b>For God loves a cheerful giver</b><br>This phrase underscores the attitude God desires in those who give. The Greek word for "cheerful" is "hilaros," which conveys a sense of joy and readiness. This reflects the character of God, who is generous and delights in giving, as seen in <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>, where every good and perfect gift is described as coming from above. The cheerful giver mirrors God's own nature, and this attitude is celebrated throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a>, which states that a generous person will be blessed. This principle also points to the ultimate example of Jesus Christ, who gave Himself willingly and joyfully for the salvation of humanity, as described in <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, writing to the church in Corinth to encourage generosity and proper attitudes towards giving.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and diversity, where the early Christian church faced various challenges, including issues related to giving and generosity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, who were being encouraged to contribute to a collection for the impoverished believers in Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_church.htm">Jerusalem Church</a></b><br>The early Christian community in Jerusalem, which was experiencing financial hardship and was the intended beneficiary of the collection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate recipient of our giving, who values the heart and attitude behind the act of giving.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_giving.htm">The Heart of Giving</a></b><br>Our giving should be a reflection of our heart's decision, not influenced by external pressures or guilt.

Nicom.</span> iii., c. 2). Such, St. Paul teaches, should be the purpose of the giver--not the outcome of a spent emotion, or a promise half-regretted, but formed with a clear well-defined perception of all attendant circumstances, and therefore neither "grudgingly," as regards amount, nor with reluctance, as giving under pressure.<p><span class= "bld">God loveth a cheerful giver.</span>--As in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-21.htm" title="Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.">2Corinthians 8:21</a>, so here, we have a distinct echo from the Book of Proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/22-8.htm" title="He that sows iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.">Proverbs 22:8</a>) as it stands in the Greek version. In that version we find the following: "He that soweth wicked things shall reap evils, and shall complete the penalty of his deed. God blesseth a cheerful man and a giver, and shall complete" (in a good sense) "the incompleteness of his works." It is obvious that this differs much from the Hebrew, which is represented in the English version, and it is interesting as showing that St. Paul used the LXX., and habitually quoted from it, and not from the Hebrew. As coming so soon after the quotation from <a href="/proverbs/3-4.htm" title="So shall you find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.">Proverbs 3:4</a> in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-21.htm" title="Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.">2Corinthians 8:21</a>, it seems to suggest that the Apostle had recently been studying that book, and that his mind was full of its teaching. As a law of action, it may be noted that the principle has a far wider range of application than that of simple alms-giving. Cheerfulness in visits of sympathy, in the daily offices of kindness, in the life of home, in giving instruction or advice--all come under the head of that which God approves and loves. So the greatest of Greek ethical teachers had refused the title of "liberal" to the man who gave without pleasure in the act of giving. The pain he feels proves that if he could he would rather have the money than do the noble action (Aristotle, <span class= "ital">Eth. Nicom.</span> iv., c. 1).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In his heart.</span> The heart must not only go with but anticipate the hand. <span class="cmt_word">Grudgingly</span>; literally, <span class="accented">from grief</span> (<a href="/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a>; <a href="/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A cheerful giver.</span> The phrase is from the addition to <a href="/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a>, which is found in the LXX.; except that "loveth" is substituted for "blesseth."
