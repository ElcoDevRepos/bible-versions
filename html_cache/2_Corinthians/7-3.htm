This reflects his pastoral heart and desire to build up rather than tear down. In the broader context of 2 Corinthians, Paul addresses issues within the church but emphasizes reconciliation and restoration. This approach aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>, where He states that He did not come to condemn the world but to save it. Paul's method of correction is rooted in love and concern for the spiritual well-being of the church.<p><b>I have said before that you so occupy our hearts</b><br>Paul's deep affection for the Corinthian believers is evident here. The phrase indicates a strong emotional bond and commitment. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where relationships within the early church were often likened to familial ties. Paul's use of "our hearts" suggests a collective sentiment shared by his fellow workers, emphasizing unity and shared mission. This mirrors the communal nature of the early Christian communities, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-47</a>, where believers shared everything in common and supported one another.<p><b>that we live and die together with you.</b><br>This phrase underscores the depth of Paul's commitment to the Corinthians, indicating a willingness to share in both their joys and sufferings. It reflects the early Christian understanding of fellowship (koinonia), which involved sharing life deeply with one another. Historically, this was a radical departure from the individualism of Greco-Roman society. Paul's words echo the sentiment found in <a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>, where believers are encouraged to rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep. This commitment to live and die together also points to the ultimate example of Jesus Christ, who laid down His life for His friends (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>), serving as a model for Christian relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with a heart of love and concern.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled congregation in the city of Corinth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its commerce and diverse population, which presented unique challenges for the early church.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul's_previous_visit.htm">Paul's Previous Visit</a></b><br>Refers to the earlier interactions and letters Paul had with the Corinthians, which were sometimes marked by tension and correction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul's_ministry_team.htm">Paul's Ministry Team</a></b><br>Those who worked alongside Paul, sharing in his mission and his deep affection for the churches he planted.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_a_shepherd.htm">The Heart of a Shepherd</a></b><br>Paul exemplifies the heart of a true shepherd, one who deeply loves and is committed to the well-being of his flock.

We trace here a sudden revulsion of feeling. What he had just said seemed to imply that he condemned them for even listening to the calumnies which had been circulated against him, for joining in any measure even of outward friendship with men of evil lives; and then there rushes on his memory the recollection of all the good news which Titus had brought. Indignation and jealous sensitiveness are swallowed up in the overflowing thankfulness to which those tidings had given birth at the time, and which were now renewed.<p><span class= "bld">I have said before . . .</span>--He had not used the form of expression before, as far as this letter is concerned, but the fact was implied in what he had said in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged.">2Corinthians 6:11</a> : "Our heart is enlarged." The words that follow are partly an almost proverbial expression for strong attachment, as in Horace (<span class= "ital">Odes,</span> iii. 9): "Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens"--<p>"With thee I fain would live,<p>With thee I fain would die;"<p>partly with a profounder meaning, that, whether in death or life (the order of the words throws us back on "dying, but behold, we live," in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;">2Corinthians 6:9</a>), his heart and prayers would be with them and for them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I speak not this to condemn you.</span> "Not by way of condemnation am I speaking."

This is no mere conventional expression of deep affection, like Horace's, "Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens;" nor is it the description of some compact for life and death like that of the Theban Band. It has the deeper meaning which was involved by the words "life" and "death" on the lips of a Christian (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-11.htm">2 Corinthians 4:11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-9.htm">2 Corinthians 6:9</a>).
