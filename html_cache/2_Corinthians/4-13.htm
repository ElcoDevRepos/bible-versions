The use of "what is written" underscores the authority and continuity of Scripture. Paul often draws from the Hebrew Scriptures to validate his teachings, showing the unity between the Old and New Testaments. This connection highlights the importance of the Old Testament as foundational to Christian doctrine.<p><b>&#8220;I believed, therefore I have spoken,&#8221;</b><br>This quote from <a href="/psalms/116-10.htm">Psalm 116:10</a> reflects a personal testimony of faith leading to proclamation. The psalmist, likely David, expresses trust in God amidst affliction, which compels him to speak out. This principle of faith leading to testimony is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in figures like the prophets who spoke God's word despite opposition. It emphasizes the transformative power of belief that naturally results in verbal witness.<p><b>we who have the same spirit of faith</b><br>Paul identifies with the psalmist, suggesting that the same spirit of faith that inspired the psalmist is present in believers. This "spirit of faith" is not merely human resolve but is empowered by the Holy Spirit, who enables believers to trust and proclaim God's truth. This connection to the Holy Spirit is consistent with Paul's teachings elsewhere, such as in <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-16</a>, where the Spirit affirms believers' identity as God's children.<p><b>also believe and therefore speak</b><br>Paul asserts that belief naturally leads to proclamation. This reflects the early Christian understanding that faith is not a private matter but one that must be shared. The apostles, filled with the Holy Spirit, boldly preached the gospel despite persecution (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>). This phrase underscores the responsibility of believers to testify to their faith, following the example of the early church and fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and significant trade.

It will be noted that the context of the words quoted is eminently in harmony with the feelings to which the Apostle has just given expression: "The sorrows of death compassed me; the pains of hell gat hold of me. I found trouble and heaviness . . . I was brought low . . . Thou hast delivered my soul from death" (<a href="/context/psalms/116-3.htm" title="The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell got hold on me: I found trouble and sorrow.">Psalm 116:3-8</a>).

It is from <a href="/psalms/116-10.htm">Psalm 116:10</a>, a psalm which corresponded with St. Paul's mood because it was written in trouble sustained by faith. And this faith inspires him with the conviction that, after "the body of this death," and after this death in life, there should begin for him also the life in death. St. Paul says nothing as to the authorship of the psalm, which probably belongs to a period far later than that of David.
