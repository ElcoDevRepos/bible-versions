Paul warns against accepting teachings about Jesus that differ from the apostolic message. The early church faced challenges from various groups, such as the Judaizers, who sought to impose Jewish customs on Gentile believers, and Gnostics, who distorted the nature of Christ. This warning is consistent with Paul's other letters, such as <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>, where he emphasizes the importance of adhering to the true gospel. The phrase underscores the necessity of discernment and fidelity to the teachings of the apostles, who were eyewitnesses to Jesus' life and ministry.<p><b>or if you receive a different spirit than the One you received</b><br>Paul refers to the Holy Spirit, who was given to believers as a seal and guarantee of their salvation (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>). The "different spirit" suggests teachings or influences that are contrary to the work of the Holy Spirit. In 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>, believers are instructed to test the spirits to see whether they are from God, indicating the presence of deceptive spirits. The early church was aware of spiritual warfare and the need to remain vigilant against false spiritual influences that could lead them away from the truth.<p><b>or a different gospel than the one you accepted</b><br>The "different gospel" refers to any message that deviates from the core message of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ alone. Paul consistently warned against such distortions, as seen in <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>, where he condemns any gospel contrary to the one he preached. The early church was susceptible to teachings that added to or subtracted from the gospel, such as legalism or antinomianism. This phrase emphasizes the importance of maintaining the purity of the gospel message as it was originally delivered by the apostles.<p><b>you put up with it very easily</b><br>This phrase indicates the Corinthians' susceptibility to accepting false teachings without much resistance. It reflects a broader issue of spiritual immaturity and lack of discernment within the Corinthian church. Paul expresses concern over their willingness to tolerate teachings that compromise the truth of the gospel. This admonition serves as a call to vigilance and steadfastness in the faith, echoing the exhortation in <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a> to no longer be children, tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with concern over false teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community struggling with false apostles and teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_apostles.htm">False Apostles</a></b><br>Individuals who were misleading the Corinthians by preaching a different Jesus and gospel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The true subject of the gospel Paul preached, whose identity and message were being distorted.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Spirit received by believers, distinct from the "different spirit" mentioned by Paul.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_against_false_teachings.htm">Guard Against False Teachings</a></b><br>Believers must be vigilant and discerning, testing all teachings against the truth of Scripture to avoid being led astray by false doctrines.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_knowing_the_true_jesus.htm">The Importance of Knowing the True Jesus</a></b><br>Understanding the true nature and teachings of Jesus Christ is crucial for maintaining a sound faith and recognizing distortions of the gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit guides believers into all truth.

One thing, at least, is clear--that their Jesus was not his Jesus--not the Friend and Brother of mankind who had died for all men, that He might reconcile them to God. Reasoning from probabilities, we may, perhaps, infer that they spoke of Him as the head of a Jewish kingdom, requiring circumcision and all the ordinances of the Law as a condition of admission to it.<p><span class= "bld">If ye receive another spirit.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">a different spirit,</span> as showing that the word is not the same as in the previous clause. The words point, it is clear, to a counterfeit inspiration, perhaps like that of those who had interrupted the praises of the Church with the startling cry, "Anathema to Jesus!" (See Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1Corinthians 12:3</a>.) Such as these were the "false prophets" of <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.">1John 4:3</a>, simulating the phenomena of inspiration, perhaps thought of by the Apostles as really acting under the inspiration of an evil spirit. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that cometh.</span> Apparently an allusion to some recent and rival teacher. <span class="cmt_word">Another Jesus</span>.

The Jesus preached was the same; the gospel accepted, the Spirit received, were supposed to remain unaltered. Ye might well bear with him. This is not without a touch of irony. You are all set against me; and yet the newcomer does not profess to preach to you another Jesus, or impart a different Spirit! Had he done so, you might have had some excuse (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) for listening to him.
