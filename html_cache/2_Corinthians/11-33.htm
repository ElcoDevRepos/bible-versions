The use of a basket indicates a humble and precarious means of escape, emphasizing Paul's vulnerability and the urgency of the situation. Baskets were common in ancient times for carrying goods, and their use here underscores the resourcefulness required in dire circumstances. This event is also recounted in <a href="/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>, providing a parallel account that confirms the historical reliability of Paul's narrative.<p><b>through a window in the wall</b><br>The mention of a window in the wall suggests a house built into or upon the city wall, a common architectural feature in ancient cities like Damascus. This strategic location allowed for a discreet escape route. The city walls of ancient Damascus were significant for defense, and having a window in the wall would have been an advantageous position for both trade and potential escape. This detail highlights the clandestine nature of Paul's escape, as well as the cooperation of his followers who aided him.<p><b>and escaped his grasp</b><br>The "his" in this phrase refers to the governor under King Aretas, who was seeking to arrest Paul. This pursuit was likely due to Paul's bold preaching of the Gospel, which threatened both Jewish and Roman authorities. The escape signifies divine intervention and protection over Paul's life, allowing him to continue his missionary work. This event is a testament to God's providence and the fulfillment of His plans despite human opposition. It also echoes other biblical narratives where God's chosen servants are delivered from peril, such as David's escapes from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/19-12.htm">1 Samuel 19:12</a>) and the Israelites' escape from Egypt (Exodus 14).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is recounting his experiences and hardships for the sake of the Gospel.

The simple word &#8220;But&#8221; ties this thought to a real incident that proves the point: the apostle&#8217;s ministry began, not with applause, but with being let down like contraband. As he elsewhere reminds us, &#8220;I will boast all the more gladly in my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest on me&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p>Key reminders:<p>&#8226; God often moves forward His plan through humble, even awkward moments.<p>&#8226; The Lord honors obedience, not image.<p>Cross reference: <a href="/acts/9-23.htm">Acts 9:23-24</a> describes the hostile plot that made such a lowering necessary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in a basket</b><p>Nothing glamorous here&#8212;no royal entourage, no miracle chariot&#8212;just a large wicker or rope basket, the sort used for hauling goods.

Such windows looked out over the surrounding terrain&#8212;perfect for a quiet getaway. Scripture offers parallels: Rahab sent Israel&#8217;s spies away &#8220;through the window&#8221; in Jericho&#8217;s wall (<a href="/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a>), and Michal &#8220;let David down through the window, and he fled and escaped&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/19-12.htm">1 Samuel 19:12</a>). Each account underscores God&#8217;s provision when His servants face lethal opposition.<p>Points to note:<p>&#8226; The Lord often supplies hidden exits before crisis strikes (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Trust means acting on those providential openings without delay.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and escaped his grasp</b><p>&#8220;His&#8221; refers to the governor under King Aretas, acting on behalf of hostile Jewish leaders (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32</a>; <a href="/acts/9-24.htm">Acts 9:24</a>). Paul&#8217;s deliverance showcases both God&#8217;s sovereignty and the human responsibility of swift obedience. Later Paul tells Timothy, &#8220;The Lord rescued me from all of them&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-11.htm">2 Timothy 3:11</a>). Echoing the psalmist, &#8220;We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/124-7.htm">Psalm 124:7</a>).<p>Takeaways:<p>&#8226; God protects until our mission is complete (<a href="/psalms/91-2.htm">Psalm 91:2, 11</a>).<p>&#8226; Escape is not retreat but repositioning for continued ministry (<a href="/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a> offers more than an intriguing escape story. It vividly illustrates how God uses humble means, everyday objects, hidden pathways, and timely deliverance to advance His gospel through servants willing to embrace weakness. Paul&#8217;s basket ride out of Damascus stands as living proof that the Lord&#8217;s power is perfected in vulnerability and that no wall, ruler, or scheme can thwart His calling on a surrendered life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">Through a window in a basket . . .</span>--On the mode of escape, see Notes on <a href="/context/acts/9-24.htm" title="But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.">Acts 9:24-25</a>. So the spies escaped from the house of Rahab (<a href="/joshua/2-15.htm" title="Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was on the town wall, and she dwelled on the wall.">Joshua 2:15</a>), and David from the pursuit of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/19-12.htm" title="So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.">1Samuel 19:12</a>). The word which St. Paul uses for "basket" (<span class= "ital">sargane</span>) implies, perhaps, a more vivid personal recollection, as meaning specifically a rope-work hamper. St. Luke employs the more general term, <span class= "ital">spuris.</span> (See Note on <a href="/matthew/15-32.htm" title="Then Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.">Matthew 15:32</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Through a window.</span> A "little door," or lattice in some house which abutted on the wall. <span class="cmt_word">In a basket</span> (comp. <a href="/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/19-12.htm">1 Samuel 19:12</a>). The word used by St. Luke in <a href="/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a> is <span class="accented">spuris</span>, which is a general name for a large basket. The word here used is <span class="accented">sargane</span>, which is defined by Hesychius to be a basket of wickerwork, but which may also mean a rope basket. This particular incident, no doubt, seems to be less perilous and trying than many which St. Paul has already mentioned. We must, however, remember that escape from a window in the lofty wall of a city guarded by patrols was very perilous, and also that such a method of concealment was very trying to the dignity of an Oriental rabbi, such as St. Paul had been. Further, it is clear that St. Paul only mentions this as the earliest incident in along line of perils which it had been his original intention to recount. But at this point he was interrupted, and laid aside his task of dictation - an incident which has not unfrequently had its effect in literature. When next he resumed, the Epistle, he was no longer in the mood to break through his rule of reticence on these subjects. He had played "the fool" and "the madman," as he says of himself with indignant irony, enough; and he proceeds to speak of other personal claims which he regards as more Important and more Divine. Of all "chapters of unwritten history," not one is more deeply to be regretted than the one which we have them lost. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I was lowered</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#967;&#945;&#955;&#940;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(echalasth&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5465.htm">Strong's 5465: </a> </span><span class="str2">To let down, lower, slacken, loosen.
