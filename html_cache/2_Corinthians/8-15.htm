The gathering of manna was a test of obedience and reliance on God's provision. The phrase suggests that those who gathered more than they needed found that it did not result in surplus, emphasizing God's provision and the principle of equality among the community.<p><b>and he who gathered little had no shortfall.&#8221;</b><br>This continues the reference to the manna, where even those who gathered less found they had enough.

Just as Israel learned through manna that daily provision comes from the Lord (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4&#8211;5</a>), the Corinthian church is called to trust God&#8217;s economy of grace (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He who gathered much</b><p>In the wilderness, some Israelites collected more manna than others.
