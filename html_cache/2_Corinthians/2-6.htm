In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5</a>, Paul had previously instructed the church to expel a man involved in sexual immorality. The punishment here likely refers to that corrective measure. The concept of church discipline is rooted in the desire for repentance and restoration, as seen in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>, where Jesus outlines steps for addressing sin within the community. The goal is not merely punitive but redemptive, aiming to bring the individual back into right relationship with God and the church.<p><b>by the majority</b><br>This indicates that the decision to impose punishment was made collectively by the church body, emphasizing the communal nature of church discipline. In the early church, decisions were often made by consensus or majority, reflecting a democratic process within the ecclesiastical structure. This communal approach is seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> during the Jerusalem Council, where the apostles and elders, along with the whole church, participated in decision-making. The involvement of the majority underscores the importance of unity and collective responsibility in maintaining the purity and integrity of the church.<p><b>is sufficient for him</b><br>Paul acknowledges that the punishment already administered is adequate, suggesting that it has achieved its intended purpose. This reflects the principle of proportionality in discipline, where the punishment should fit the offense and not be excessive. The sufficiency of the punishment implies that the individual has likely shown signs of repentance, aligning with the ultimate goal of restoration. This aligns with the biblical theme of mercy triumphing over judgment, as seen in <a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>, and the call to forgive and comfort the repentant sinner, which Paul elaborates on in the following verses.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians, addressing issues within the church and providing guidance on how to handle them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Corinth dealing with internal conflicts and disciplinary matters.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offender.htm">The Offender</a></b><br>An unnamed individual within the Corinthian church who had committed a sin that warranted church discipline.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_majority.htm">The Majority</a></b><br>The collective body of the Corinthian church members who participated in the disciplinary action against the offender.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and moral challenges, which influenced the church's dynamics.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_discipline.htm">The Purpose of Discipline</a></b><br>Church discipline is meant to correct and restore, not to punish harshly or indefinitely.

Unrepentant sin in the fellowship demands discipline. In <a href="/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3-5</a>, Paul had already instructed the church to remove a man living immorally; that earlier command forms the backdrop. Like the corrective measures in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6-15</a>, this &#8220;punishment&#8221; is not vengeance but loving correction&#8212;discipline designed to protect the purity of Christ&#8217;s body and awaken the offender to his need for repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Imposed on him</b><p>The focus is a specific offender, not a vague class of sinners. <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a> reminds believers, &#8220;If someone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him with a spirit of gentleness.&#8221; Here, Paul highlights that discipline has a personal aim: it touches the heart of the one who sinned. By naming the offender only as &#8220;him,&#8221; Paul preserves dignity while still dealing realistically with wrongdoing, much as he does later in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8-10</a> when speaking of godly sorrow bringing repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By the majority</b><p>Discipline was carried out &#8220;by the majority,&#8221; underscoring that church action was corporate, not the whim of a few. This echoes Jesus&#8217; instruction in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>: the whole assembly may eventually be involved when a brother refuses to listen. <a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a> shows the early church making decisions together; Paul expects similar congregational responsibility here. Unity in discipline safeguards against partiality (<a href="/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21</a>) and bears witness that holiness matters to the whole family of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is sufficient</b><p>The phrase signals completion: enough has been done. <a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a> speaks of discipline that &#8220;yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness&#8221; once it has accomplished its purpose. Likewise, <a href="/1_corinthians/11-32.htm">1 Corinthians 11:32</a> notes that the Lord disciplines us &#8220;so that we will not be condemned with the world.&#8221; Paul senses that the offender&#8217;s sorrow (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-9.htm">2 Corinthians 7:9-11</a>) proves genuine; continued punishment would now be excessive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For him</b><p>Everything carried out was &#8220;for him&#8221;&#8212;for his benefit, not his ruin. Paul immediately adds, &#8220;Instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-7.htm">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>). Restoration is the goal. <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a> urges believers to &#8220;carry one another&#8217;s burdens,&#8221; and <a href="/2_timothy/2-24.htm">2 Timothy 2:24-25</a> highlights gentle correction so that God may grant repentance. The offender stands ready to be welcomed back into fellowship, strengthened rather than shamed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_corinthians/2-6.htm">2 Corinthians 2:6</a> shows church discipline working as God intends. A specific sinner faced corporate correction; the majority acted together, and the punishment achieved its aim. Because the discipline is now &#8220;sufficient,&#8221; the time has come for forgiveness and restoration. Holiness and mercy walk hand in hand, preserving the purity of the church while seeking the full recovery of every member.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Sufficient to such a man is this punishment.</span>--Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">this censure,</span> or <span class= "ital">rebuke:</span> the Greek word <span class= "ital">epitimia</span> being different from those in <a href="/matthew/25-46.htm" title="And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.">Matthew 25:46</a>, and in <a href="/hebrews/10-29.htm" title="Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?">Hebrews 10:29</a>. It is natural to infer that this was somewhat after the pattern of the course marked out in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1Corinthians 5:3-5</a>. A meeting of the Church had been held, and the man delivered to Satan. Possibly this was followed by some suffering of body, supernaturally inflicted, or coming as the natural consequence (not less divine because natural) of remorse and shame. It was almost certainly followed by ex-communication and exclusion from religious and social fellowship. St. Paul had clearly heard what it had been, and thought that it had been enough.<p><span class= "bld">Which was inflicted of many.</span>--Actually, <span class= "ital">by the majority.</span> The decision, then, had not been unanimous. The minority may have been either members of the Judaising "Cephas "party, resenting what they would look upon as St. Paul's dictation, and perhaps falling back on the Jewish casuistry, which taught that all the natural relationships of a proselyte were cancelled by his conversion; or the party of license, against whom the Apostle reasons in 1 Corinthians 6-8, and who boasted of their freedom. The Passover argument and the form of the sentence in 1 Corinthians 5 alike suggest the idea that the offender and those who defended him were Jews. On the other hand, see Note on <a href="/2_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.">2Corinthians 7:12</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sufficient to such a man is this punishment.</span> What the punishment was we do not know, but of course the Corinthians knew that what St. Paul had directed them to do was to summon the Church together, and there,by excommunicating the man, "to hand him over to Satan." But this handing over to Satan was, as we have seen, designed solely for a merciful purpose, and to awaken his repentance, so as to secure his ultimate salvation (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-4.htm">1 Corinthians 5:4, 5</a>). Whether the Corinthians had done exactly as St. Paul bade them is uncertain; but whatever they had done is here acquiesced in by St. Paul, and even if (as we may suspect) they had dealt more leniently with the offender than he originally intended, he here not only refrains from urging them to use greater severity, but even exhorts them to a still more absolute condonation. St. Paul's object had not been that they should take a particular course of action, but that they should bring about a desired result. The result had been achieved, and now the matter might rest. <span class="accented">To such a man</span>. St. Paul mercifully abstains from recording his name or from thrusting him into unnecessary prominence before the assembly in which the letter would be read. The apostle evidently entered into the Jewish feeling that there is a criminal cruelty in needlessly calling a blush of shame into a brother's face. <span class="accented">This punishment</span>. The word <span class="accented">epitimia</span>, which occurs here only in the New Testament, but is also found in Wisd. 3:10, means "punishment," as in later Greek, and is not used in its classical sense of "rebuke" (Vulgate, <span class="accented">objurgatio</span>); but the mildness of the word, perhaps, implies that the Corinthians had not resorted to the severest measures. <span class="cmt_word">Which was inflicted of many;</span> rather, <span class="accented">by the majority</span>. The verb is expressed in the original, and St. Paul seems to allude to the steps taken, whatever they were, with a certain dignified reticence. It is obvious that there were still some opponents of St. Paul in the Church, who retained in this matter their "inflated" sentiments of spurious independence; and this may, perhaps, have driven others into too rigid an attitude of severity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
