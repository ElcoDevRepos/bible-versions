In the context of <a href="/2_corinthians/12.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>, Paul is recounting a personal revelation where God responds to his plea regarding a "thorn in the flesh." This highlights the personal relationship between God and His followers, emphasizing that God speaks to His people, often in response to their prayers and struggles.<p><b>My grace is sufficient for you</b><br>God's grace is portrayed as all-encompassing and adequate for every need. The concept of grace is central to Christian theology, representing unmerited favor and divine assistance given to humans for their regeneration and sanctification. This assurance of sufficiency is a reminder of God's provision and support, echoing themes found in other scriptures such as <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>, where God promises to meet all needs according to His riches in glory.<p><b>for My power is perfected in weakness</b><br>This paradoxical statement reveals a key principle of Christian faith: God's power is most evident when human strength is lacking. It reflects the idea that human weakness provides an opportunity for divine strength to be displayed. This is consistent with the biblical narrative where God often chooses the weak and humble to accomplish His purposes, as seen in the stories of David, Gideon, and others. It also points to the ultimate example of Christ, whose crucifixion appeared as weakness but was the means of salvation.<p><b>Therefore I will boast all the more gladly in my weaknesses</b><br>Paul's response to God's declaration is one of acceptance and even joy. This attitude is counter-cultural, as boasting typically involves one's strengths and achievements. However, Paul embraces his weaknesses as they allow for the manifestation of God's power. This reflects a deep understanding of the Christian life, where humility and reliance on God are valued over self-sufficiency.<p><b>so that the power of Christ may rest on me</b><br>The phrase suggests a continuous and abiding presence of Christ's power in Paul's life. The imagery of "resting" implies a settled and enduring state, reminiscent of the Shekinah glory that rested on the tabernacle in the Old Testament. This connection underscores the idea that believers are temples of the Holy Spirit, where God's presence dwells. It also aligns with the promise of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, where He assures His followers of His continual presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, who is sharing his personal experience of receiving a revelation from God about the sufficiency of His grace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>The city where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.

Our limitations are not liabilities; they are invitations for Christ to display His might.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Therefore I will boast all the more gladly in my weaknesses</b><p>Paul&#8217;s response flips natural logic. Instead of hiding weaknesses, he celebrates them because they showcase Christ.<p>&#8226; He had earlier &#8220;boasted&#8221; only in the Lord (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-17.htm">2 Corinthians 10:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a>). Now he applies that principle to infirmities, hardships, and insults (12:10).<p>&#8226; Troubles become testimonies (<a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Joy replaces self-pity: &#8220;I will rejoice&#8221; echoes <a href="/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17&#8211;18</a>&#8212;a choice to praise when circumstances stay hard.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that the power of Christ may rest on me</b><p>The goal is not suffering for its own sake but the abiding presence of Christ&#8217;s power. &#8220;Rest on&#8221; pictures a tent spread over Paul&#8212;language that recalls the glory cloud over the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34&#8211;38</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ pitches His tent over the believer, providing protection, strength, and companionship (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p>&#8226; As the Spirit &#8220;came upon&#8221; Mary to overshadow her (<a href="/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>), so His power overshadows every surrendered saint.<p>&#8226; When we accept weakness, we make room for that overshadowing. The result is effective ministry, enduring faith, and eternal fruit (<a href="/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus told Paul&#8212;and tells us&#8212;that His grace already matches every need. Our weaknesses are not obstacles; they are openings for Christ&#8217;s perfected power. Instead of hiding or resenting our limitations, we can gladly boast in them, confident that the Savior&#8217;s presence will rest on us, turning fragile vessels into living displays of His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee.</span>--The words fit in, more or less, with each of the two views that have been discussed above. From one point of view, however, it seems infinitely more in harmony with our thoughts of God, that the prayer to be relieved from pain should be refused, because it was working out a higher perfection than was attainable without it, than that a deaf ear should have been turned to a prayer to be relieved from the temptation to impurity. Such a prayer seems to us to carry with it something like an assurance of its own prevailing power. Some of the better MSS. omit the possessive "My," and with that reading the words take the form of a general axiom affirming that, in the highest sense, "might is perfected in weakness." The last word is the same as that translated "infirmity" in the next clause. The variation, as concealing this, is so far unfortunate.<p><span class= "bld">Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities.</span>--The word, as has just been said, is the same as the "weakness" in the answer to his prayer. He finds not comfort only, but actual delight, in his consciousness of weakness, because it is balanced by the sense that the might of Christ <span class= "ital">dwells in him and around him.</span> The word for "rest" is literally, as a like word in <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>, <span class= "ital">to dwell as in a tent,</span> and suggests the thought that the might of Christ was to him as the Shechinah cloud of glory encompassing him and protecting him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto me.</span> The original is much more forcible: "And he <span class="accented">has</span> said to me." <span class="cmt_word">Is sufficient for thee.</span> A similar phrase, though in a very different context, occurs in <a href="/deuteronomy/3-26.htm">Deuteronomy 3:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">My strength is made perfect in weakness</span> (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-3.htm">1 Corinthians 2:3-5</a>).
