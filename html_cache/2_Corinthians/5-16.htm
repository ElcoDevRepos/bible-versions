The "flesh" refers to the worldly, human point of view, which is often limited and superficial. In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the Corinthian church, emphasizing the spiritual rebirth that comes through Christ. This new perspective transcends social status, ethnicity, or any other earthly distinctions. It aligns with <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul states that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female. This reflects the early Christian community's radical inclusivity and unity in the Spirit.<p><b>Although we once regarded Christ in this way,</b><br>Paul acknowledges that there was a time when even he, as a Pharisee, viewed Christ from a purely human standpoint. Before his conversion, Paul (then Saul) saw Jesus as a mere man, a blasphemer who threatened Jewish law and tradition. This perspective was common among those who did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah. The historical context of first-century Judaism, with its expectations of a political Messiah, contributed to this misunderstanding. Paul's personal transformation on the road to Damascus (Acts 9) serves as a powerful testimony to the change in understanding that comes with spiritual revelation.<p><b>we do so no longer.</b><br>This statement marks the profound change in how believers perceive Christ after experiencing spiritual renewal. Paul, now an apostle, sees Jesus as the risen Lord, the Son of God, and the Savior of humanity. This new understanding is not based on external appearances or human wisdom but on divine revelation and the work of the Holy Spirit. It echoes the transformation described in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, where believers are called to be transformed by the renewing of their minds. This shift in perception is foundational to the Christian faith, emphasizing the importance of seeing with spiritual eyes and understanding the true nature of Christ's mission and identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, emphasizing the transformation in how believers should view others and Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled congregation in a major Greek city, dealing with issues of division and misunderstanding of spiritual truths.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central to the passage, highlighting the shift from a worldly understanding to a spiritual recognition of His identity and mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_perspective_over_worldly_view.htm">Spiritual Perspective Over Worldly View</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to see others through the lens of Christ's love and redemption, not through worldly judgments or appearances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_in_understanding_christ.htm">Transformation in Understanding Christ</a></b><br>Our understanding of Christ should move beyond a historical or earthly perspective to a deep spiritual recognition of His divine nature and work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_christ.htm">Unity in Christ</a></b><br>In Christ, earthly distinctions fade, and we are united as one body.

Seeing Christ rightly re-creates our eyesight toward everyone else, opening the way for gospel-shaped love, unity, and mission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh.</span>--The logical dependence of this sentence on the foregoing lies in the suppressed premise, that in living not to ourselves, but to Christ, we gain new standards of judgment, new ways of looking at things. To know a man "after the flesh" is to know him by the outward accidents and circumstances of his life: his wealth, rank, culture, knowledge. St. Paul had ceased to judge of men by those standards. With him the one question was whether the man was, by his own act and choice, claiming the place which the death of Christ had secured for him, and living in Him as a new creature. That is the point of view from which he now "knows," or looks on, every man.<p><span class= "bld">Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh.</span>--What, we ask, gave occasion to this strange parenthesis? What did it mean? To what stage of the Apostle's life does it refer? (1) The answer to the first question is probably to be found in once more reading between the lines. There was, we know, a party at Corinth claiming a special relation to Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1Corinthians 1:12</a>). They probably did so as having been personal disciples. If they were like those who elsewhere claimed to speak in the name of James (<a href="/acts/15-24.htm" title="For as much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:">Acts 15:24</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-12.htm" title="For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.">Galatians 2:12</a>), they were likely to urge his claims as the brother of the Lord. To St. Paul such a way of judging would be to know Christ after the flesh--to judge of Him, as of others, by the lower standard of the world. (2) The next question is more difficult. The hypothetical form of the proposition practically implies an admission of its truth. It is hardly conceivable that he refers to the time before his conversion, and means that he too had once seen and known Jesus of Nazareth, judging of Him "after the flesh," by an earthly standard, and therefore had thought that He ought to do many things against him; or that, after the revelation of Christ in him, at the time of his conversion, he had, for a time, known Him after a manner which he now saw to be at least imperfect. The true solution of the problem is probably to be found in the fact that he had once thought, even before he appeared as the persecutor of the Church, of the Christ that was to come as others thought, that his Messianic expectations had been those of an earthly kingdom restored to Israel. Jesus of Nazareth did not fulfil those expectations, and therefore he had opposed His claim to be the Messiah. Now, he says, he had come to take a different view of the work and office of the Christ. (3) It follows, if this interpretation is correct, that he speaks of the period that preceded his conversion. not of an imperfect state of knowledge after it, out of which he had risen by progressive stages of illumination and clearer vision of the truth. Now and from henceforth, he seems to say, we think of Christ not as the King of Israel, but as the Saviour of mankind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Know no man after the flesh.</span> It is a consequence of my death with Christ that I have done with carnal, superficial, earthly, external judgments according to the appearance, and not according to the heart. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh.</span> The word for "know" is different from the one just used (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">scio</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">cognovi</span>), and may be rendered, "though we have taken note of." The whole phrase, which has been interpreted in multitudes of different ways, and has led to many different hypotheses, must be understood in accordance with the context. St. Paul is saying that he has now renounced all mere earthly and human judgments; and he here implies that the day has been (whether - which is a very unlikely view - before his conversion, when he looked on Christ as a "deceiver," or just after his conversion, when possibly he may only have known him partially as the <span class="accented">Jewish</span> Messiah) when he knew Christ only in this fleshly way; but henceforth he will know him so no more. Probably this "knowing Christ after the flesh" is a rebuke to those members of the Christ party at Corinth who may have boasted that they were superior to all others because they had personally seen or known Christ - a spirit which Christ himself not only discouraged (<a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>) but even rebuked (<a href="/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>). To St. Paul Christ is now regarded as far above all local, national, personal, and Jewish limitations, and as the principle of spiritual life in the heart of every Christian. In the view which he took of his Lord St. Paul henceforth has banished all Jewish particularism for gospel catholicity. He regards Christ, not in the light of earthly relationships and conditions, but as the risen, glorified, eternal, universal Saviour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/5-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8045;&#963;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#333;ste)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5620.htm">Strong's 5620: </a> </span><span class="str2">So that, therefore, so then, so as to.
