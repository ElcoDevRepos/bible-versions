This phrase highlights the apostle's sensitivity to the guidance of the Holy Spirit and his concern for the well-being of the churches. The lack of peace can be seen as a divine prompting, similar to how the Spirit led Paul in <a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6-7</a>, where he was prevented from preaching in certain regions. This reflects the biblical principle that God often guides His people through inner peace or unrest.<p><b>because I did not find my brother Titus there</b><br>Titus was a trusted companion and fellow worker in the ministry. His absence was significant to Paul, indicating the importance of fellowship and accountability among believers. Titus's role in the early church is further emphasized in other passages, such as <a href="/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6-7</a>, where he brings comfort to Paul. This highlights the relational aspect of ministry and the importance of reliable partners in the work of the Gospel.<p><b>So I said goodbye to them</b><br>Paul's decision to leave reflects his responsiveness to the Spirit's leading and his commitment to the mission. The act of saying goodbye suggests a respectful and intentional departure, acknowledging the relationships he had formed. This mirrors other instances in Paul's ministry where he had to make difficult decisions for the sake of the Gospel, as seen in <a href="/acts/20.htm">Acts 20:1</a>, where he departs after encouraging the disciples.<p><b>and went on to Macedonia</b><br>Macedonia was a significant region for Paul's missionary journeys, including cities like Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea. This area was crucial for the spread of Christianity in Europe. Paul's movement to Macedonia aligns with his strategic approach to evangelism, as seen in <a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9-10</a>, where he receives a vision calling him to preach there. This journey underscores the fulfillment of the Great Commission, as Paul continues to spread the Gospel to the Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians.

Compare <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>, where peace is described as the normal state for believers, and <a href="/1_samuel/30-6.htm">1 Samuel 30:6</a>, where David&#8217;s spirit is distressed until he seeks the Lord.<p>&#8226; This verse reminds us that genuine guidance can involve both open circumstances and the Lord&#8217;s inward witness (<a href="/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>). Paul weighs both.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because I did not find my brother Titus there</b><p>&#8226; Titus was carrying Paul&#8217;s earlier letter to Corinth and would bring back news (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6-7</a>). Not finding him left Paul uncertain about the Corinthians&#8217; response.<p>&#8226; The term &#8220;brother&#8221; underscores their shared faith and close partnership (<a href="/galatians/2-3.htm">Galatians 2:3</a>; <a href="/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>). Ministry is never a solo endeavor.<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s concern is pastoral, not merely logistical; his heart is knit to the wellbeing of the churches (<a href="/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So I said goodbye to them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Them&#8221; refers to believers in Troas who were benefiting from his preaching. Even fruitful ministry can be set aside when God redirects (<a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Saying goodbye shows Paul&#8217;s sensitivity; he communicates openly rather than departing abruptly (<a href="/acts/20-1.htm">Acts 20:1</a>).<p>&#8226; It illustrates the principle of prioritizing divine leading over human opportunity (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>; <a href="/james/4-15.htm">James 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and went on to Macedonia</b><p>&#8226; Macedonia lay across the Aegean, reachable only by deliberate effort.

The restless spirit finds relief when obedience meets God&#8217;s timing.<p>&#8226; The move also positions Paul for further ministry in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea, confirming <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>&#8212;God weaves every detour into His larger plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s lack of peace, his concern for Titus, the courteous farewell in Troas, and his journey to Macedonia together show a servant led by both providential openings and inner conviction.

Titus was to return to him at Troas. Not meeting him there, St. Paul, in his eager anxiety to hear something more than Timotheus had been able to tell him, left Troas, in spite of the opening which it presented for his work as a preacher of the gospel, and hastened on into Macedonia. Taking the route that he had taken before, he would probably go to Philippi, where he would find St. Luke; and we may conjecture, without much risk of error, that it was there that he and Titus met.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I had;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I have had</span>. The perfect vividly realizes the scene through which he had passed. I had no rest. St. Paul had evidently told Titus to come from his mission to Corinth and meet him at Troas. But either St. Paul reached the town earlier than he intended, or Titus had been delayed. Now, the apostle was so intensely eager to know how his rebukes had been received - the name of "Corinth" was so deeply engraven on his heart - he could so ill endure the thought of being on angry terms with converts which he so deeply loved, that the non-appearance of Titus filled him with devouring anxiety and rendered him incapable of any other work. <span class="cmt_word">In my spirit</span>; rather, <span class="accented">to my spirit</span>. It was the loftiest part of St. Paul's nature - his spirit - which was utterly incapacitated from effort by the restlessness of his miserable uncertainty about the Corinthian Church. The disclosure of such feelings ought to have had a powerful influence on the Corinthians. We see from <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5, 9</a> that St. Paul yearned for tidings of his converts with an intensity which can hardly be realized by less fervent and self-devoted natures. <span class="cmt_word">I found not Titus my brother.</span> Not only "<span class="accented">the</span> brother," but "<span class="accented">my</span> brother;" the man whom in matters of this kind I most trusted as an affectionate and able fellow worker (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-6.htm">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>). Titus, though not mentioned in the Acts, is the most prominent person in this Epistle, and it is evident that St. Paul felt for him a warm affection and respect (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-13.htm">2 Corinthians 7:13, 15</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-16.htm">2 Corinthians 8:16, 17</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Taking my leave of them;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the Christians in Troas.
