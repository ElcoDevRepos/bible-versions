This phrase highlights the futility of self-praise, which was a common practice in Greco-Roman culture where public honor and reputation were highly valued. Biblically, this aligns with <a href="/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a>, "Let another praise you, and not your own mouth," emphasizing humility and the dangers of pride. Theologically, it underscores the principle that human approval is fleeting and ultimately insignificant compared to divine approval.<p><b>but the one whom the Lord commends</b><br>This phrase shifts the focus from human approval to divine approval, which is the ultimate standard for believers. In the broader biblical narrative, God's commendation is seen in His approval of faith and obedience, as exemplified in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, where figures like Abel, Enoch, and Noah are commended for their faith. This reflects the biblical theme that true worth and validation come from God, not from human accolades. Theologically, it points to the judgment seat of Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>), where believers will receive commendation based on their faithfulness to God's calling. This phrase also echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>, where the faithful servant is commended by the master, symbolizing God's approval of those who serve Him faithfully.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.
