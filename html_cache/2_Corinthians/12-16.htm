Paul often uses rhetorical techniques to address potential objections or misunderstandings. Here, he is likely addressing concerns or accusations from the Corinthian church regarding his conduct or intentions.<p><b>I was not a burden to you</b><br>Paul emphasizes that he did not financially burden the Corinthians, as he chose not to accept support from them during his ministry there. This reflects his commitment to the gospel and his desire to avoid any appearance of exploiting the church. In <a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>, Paul discusses his right to receive support but chooses not to use it to avoid hindering the gospel.<p><b>but crafty as I am</b><br>Paul uses irony here, possibly reflecting accusations from his opponents that he was deceitful or manipulative. In 2 Corinthians, Paul defends his apostleship against false apostles who questioned his integrity. This phrase highlights the tension between Paul and those who sought to undermine his authority.<p><b>I caught you by trickery</b><br>This statement is likely sarcastic, as Paul did not use deceit in his dealings with the Corinthians. Instead, he is countering claims that his refusal of financial support was a ploy to gain influence.

Even if some Corinthian critics refused to accept his motives, Paul presses on, much like Nehemiah who kept building despite opposition (<a href="/nehemiah/6-3.htm">Nehemiah 6:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds readers that truth is not altered by opinion; Paul&#8217;s conduct stands regardless of their suspicions (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was not a burden to you</b><p>Paul again emphasizes that he never imposed financial strain on the church.<p>&#8226; He had taken support from other congregations so the Corinthians could hear the gospel free of charge (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-8.htm">2 Corinthians 11:8-9</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; By refusing aid, he mirrored Jesus&#8217; description of a true shepherd who lays down his life for the sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; His tent-making (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>) shows ministry should never be leveraged for personal profit (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but crafty as I am</b><p>The wording is ironic; Paul quotes his detractors who labeled him &#8220;crafty.&#8221;<p>&#8226; He had already rejected any hint of deceit (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Samuel, who asked, &#8220;Whose ox have I taken?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>), Paul&#8217;s life invited scrutiny.<p>&#8226; Accusations of cunning often come when light exposes darkness (<a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I caught you by trickery</b><p>Paul uses sarcasm to show the absurdity of the charge that he secretly exploited them.<p>&#8226; His only &#8220;trap&#8221; was the gospel itself, which captures hearts for Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; He never sought their money but their growth (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14, 19</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as Jesus&#8217; enemies twisted His words (<a href="/matthew/22-15.htm">Matthew 22:15</a>), Paul&#8217;s foes distorted his sacrifice, claiming ulterior motives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s statement is a masterful blend of defense and gentle irony: though some called him crafty, his record proves otherwise. He refused financial support to keep the message clear, lived transparently before them, and relied on the power of truth rather than manipulation. Any &#8220;trickery&#8221; was simply the gracious gospel drawing believers into wholehearted devotion to Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">But be it so, I did not burden you.</span>--The pronoun is again emphatic. The word for "burden" is not the same as in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-13.htm" title="For what is it wherein you were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.">2Corinthians 12:13-14</a>, but puts the fact less figuratively. The abruptness of the sentence requires us to trace between the lines the under-currents of unexpressed thoughts. The extreme, almost jealous, sensitiveness of the Apostle's nature leads him to imagine the cynical sneer with which these assertions of disinterested work would be received. "Be it so," he hears them saying; "we admit that he, in his own person, when he was with us, made no demands on our purses; but what are we to think of this 'collection for the saints'? How do we know into whose pockets that money will go? We know him to be <span class= "ital">subtle</span> enough" (the adjective is that from which we get the "subtlety" of <a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.">2Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.">2Corinthians 11:3</a>) "to take us in somehow: what if the collection be a trap?" There is a specially taunting force in the Greek for "<span class= "ital">being</span> crafty," as taking the fact for granted, and assuming that it would inevitably lead on to some new development of that character in act.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But be it so, I did not burden you.</span> The "I" is emphatic. It is shocking to think that, even after Paul has so triumphantly cleared himself from the disgraceful charge of trying to make gain out of the Corinthians, he should still be obliged to meet the slanderous innuendo that, even if he had not personally tried to get anything out of them, still he had done so indirectly through the agency of Titus. <span class="cmt_word">Being crafty, I caught you with guile.</span> He is here quoting the sneer of his enemies (see what he has already said in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>).
