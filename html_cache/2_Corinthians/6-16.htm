In the historical context, Corinth was a city filled with pagan temples and idol worship, which was a significant part of daily life. The temple of God refers to the sacred space dedicated to the worship of the one true God, contrasting sharply with the temples of idols, which were often associated with immorality and false worship. This echoes the Old Testament teachings, such as in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>, where God commands His people to have no other gods before Him. The rhetorical question emphasizes the exclusivity of worship that God demands.<p><b>For we are the temple of the living God.</b><br>Paul asserts that believers collectively form the temple of God, a concept rooted in the New Testament understanding that God's presence now dwells within His people through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a>). This reflects a shift from the Old Testament, where God's presence was localized in the physical temple in Jerusalem. The term "living God" contrasts with lifeless idols, highlighting the active and dynamic relationship between God and His people. This idea is also seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21-22</a>, where believers are described as being built together into a dwelling place for God.<p><b>As God has said: &#8220;I will dwell with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be My people.&#8221;</b><br>This promise is a composite of several Old Testament passages, including <a href="/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27</a>. It underscores the covenant relationship between God and His people, where God promises His presence and guidance. The imagery of God dwelling and walking among His people recalls the Garden of Eden, where God walked with Adam and Eve, and anticipates the ultimate fulfillment in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>, where God will dwell with humanity in the new creation. This phrase encapsulates the essence of the covenant: God's commitment to His people and their identity as His own.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance and correction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece known for its wealth and moral challenges, where the early church faced significant cultural pressures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_of_god.htm">The Temple of God</a></b><br>Refers to the spiritual dwelling place of God, which in the New Testament context, is the collective body of believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Physical representations of false gods, prevalent in Corinthian society, symbolizing anything that takes the place of God in one's life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_living_god.htm">The Living God</a></b><br>The one true God who is active and present in the lives of believers, contrasting with lifeless idols.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_incompatibility_of_idolatry_and_faith.htm">The Incompatibility of Idolatry and Faith</a></b><br>Believers are called to separate themselves from anything that competes with their devotion to God.

Just as <a href="/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-5</a> shows Dagon&#8217;s idol falling before the ark, false gods cannot stand in the presence of the true God.<p>- The prophets repeatedly warned Israel to tear down high places (<a href="/2_kings/17-9.htm">2 Kings 17:9-12</a>). Mixing worship led to exile; the lesson still stands.<p>- Jesus echoed the same line: &#8220;No one can serve two masters&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>). Loyalty is exclusive; divided allegiance dishonors the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For we are the temple of the living God</b><p>- Not a stone building but living people indwelt by the Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a>; 6:19).<p>- Where God dwells, holiness must mark the atmosphere.

His mind travels back to the controversy about things sacrificed to idols. Was there not a risk that what he had said about "width" and "expansion" of feeling would be perverted by those who claimed the right to sit at an idol's feast even in the precincts of the idol's temple (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-10.htm" title="For if any man see you which have knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;">1Corinthians 8:10</a>)? Against that perversion he thinks it necessary to enter his protest. And the ground of that protest is that they, collectively and individually (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1Corinthians 6:19</a>), are the temples of God, and that there can be no "agreement" between that temple and one dedicated to an idol. The word translated "agreement" expresses, like the English, a compact or treaty of alliance. In modern phrase, a <span class= "ital">concordat</span> between the two antagonistic systems was an impossibility.<p><span class= "bld">I will dwell in them, and walk in them.</span>--The citation which follows is, like many others in St. Paul's writings, a composite one: <a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm" title="And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you shall be my people.">Leviticus 26:12</a> giving, "I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people;" and <a href="/exodus/29-45.htm" title="And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.">Exodus 29:45</a>, "I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God." The implied premise is that wherever God dwells there is His temple. The word indicates the "sanctuary," or holiest part of the temple.
