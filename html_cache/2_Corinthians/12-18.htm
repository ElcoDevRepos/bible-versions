Titus was a trusted companion of Paul, often serving as a mediator and representative. This reflects the early church's practice of sending trusted leaders to address issues and provide guidance, as seen in <a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22-23</a> with the Jerusalem Council sending Judas and Silas. Titus's role underscores the importance of accountability and pastoral care in church leadership.<p><b>and I sent our brother with him</b><br>The "brother" mentioned is likely an unnamed co-worker in the ministry, emphasizing the collaborative nature of early Christian missions. This practice of sending multiple representatives ensured integrity and transparency, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-18.htm">2 Corinthians 8:18-19</a>, where another brother is sent with Titus to handle the collection for the Jerusalem church. This reflects the communal and accountable nature of early Christian ministry.<p><b>Did Titus exploit you in any way?</b><br>Paul's rhetorical question addresses accusations or suspicions that may have arisen about Titus's conduct. The concern for financial integrity is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-20.htm">2 Corinthians 8:20-21</a>, where he emphasizes the importance of honorable conduct in financial matters. This reflects the broader biblical principle of stewardship and integrity, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>, which condemns dishonest scales.<p><b>Did we not walk in the same Spirit</b><br>Paul emphasizes the unity and consistency in the conduct of his ministry team, highlighting their shared commitment to the Holy Spirit's guidance. This reflects the early church's emphasis on spiritual unity and the fruit of the Spirit as evidence of genuine Christian living, as outlined in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. The phrase underscores the importance of spiritual integrity and consistency in leadership.<p><b>and follow in the same footsteps?</b><br>The imagery of walking in footsteps suggests a pattern of behavior and lifestyle that is consistent with the teachings of Christ. This echoes Paul's exhortation in <a href="/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>, where he urges believers to imitate him as he imitates Christ. The concept of following in footsteps also connects to the idea of discipleship and the call to live a life that reflects the teachings and example of Jesus, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians, defending his ministry and integrity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A trusted companion and fellow worker of Paul, sent to Corinth to assist in the ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_brother.htm">The Brother</a></b><br>An unnamed brother in Christ who accompanied Titus, likely a respected member of the early church.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece where the church Paul is addressing is located.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_visit.htm">The Visit</a></b><br>Refers to the mission of Titus and the brother to the Corinthian church, emphasizing integrity and shared purpose.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_ministry.htm">Integrity in Ministry</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes that neither he nor Titus took advantage of the Corinthians, highlighting the importance of integrity in Christian leadership.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_of_spirit.htm">Unity of Spirit</a></b><br>The phrase "walk in the same spirit" suggests a shared commitment to the gospel and a unified approach to ministry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_leadership.htm">Trust in Leadership</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s trust in Titus and the unnamed brother reflects the importance of having reliable and faithful leaders in the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability.htm">Accountability</a></b><br>By questioning whether Titus took advantage of the Corinthians, Paul demonstrates the need for accountability in ministry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consistency_in_conduct.htm">Consistency in Conduct</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s reference to following in the same footsteps underscores the need for consistency in living out the Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Corinthians_12_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Corinthians 12:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Cor_12_18_Accountability_in_ministry.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 12:18 demonstrate accountability in Christian leadership and ministry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Paul_s_integrity_in_church_finances.htm">What does Paul's integrity in 2 Corinthians 12:18 teach about handling church finances?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Paul_s_transparency_to_finances.htm">How can we apply Paul's example of transparency in our personal financial dealings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Scriptures_on_honest_leadership.htm">What other scriptures emphasize honesty and integrity in leadership roles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Align_actions_with_Paul_s_example.htm">How can we ensure our actions align with Paul's example in 2 Corinthians 12:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Cor_12_18_on_Paul_Titus_church_ties.htm">What does 2 Corinthians 12:18 reveal about Paul's relationship with Titus and the early church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Cor_12_18_on_trust_in_leadership.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 12:18 address issues of trust and integrity in Christian leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Titus_important_in_2_Cor_12_18.htm">Why is the mention of Titus significant in understanding the context of 2 Corinthians 12:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_corinthians_12.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Corinthians 12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_the_bible_support_conversion_therapy.htm">Is conversion therapy supported by biblical teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_to_fully_live_christ's_teachings.htm">How can we live fully in Christ's teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_apollos'_delay_affect_biblical_consistency.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12 -

He had already proven Titus&#8217; care for them during an earlier visit (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-13.htm">2 Corinthians 7:13-15</a>). By stating &#8220;I urged,&#8221; Paul discloses both urgency and affection. He wanted the church strengthened, not merely informed.<p>&#8226; The personal nudge shows Paul&#8217;s shepherd&#8217;s heart, similar to <a href="/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a> where he sends helpers ahead to encourage believers.<p>&#8226; The initiative also refutes any rumor that Titus came on his own agenda; he was on mission from Paul for their benefit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I sent our brother with him</b><p>Paul adds that another trusted coworker accompanied Titus (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/8-18.htm">2 Corinthians 8:18-22</a>).

They know from firsthand experience that Titus never took advantage of them&#8212;financially or otherwise (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-17.htm">2 Corinthians 12:17</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The rhetorical &#8220;Did he?&#8221; expects a firm &#8220;No.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s gospel team operated in sharp contrast to the &#8220;super-apostles&#8221; who were happy to profit from the church (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-20.htm">2 Corinthians 11:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Did we not walk in the same Spirit</b><p>Paul links their conduct to a shared spiritual source: the Holy Spirit.

Paul, Titus, and the unnamed brother modeled Christ-like sacrifice and consistency.<p>&#8226; Their &#8220;footsteps&#8221; showed the narrow path of humble service, not the broad road of self-promotion.<p>&#8226; The church could test any teacher by this standard: do their lives match Paul&#8217;s gospel-shaped pattern?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a> serves as Paul&#8217;s open ledger. He urged Titus to visit; he added a reputable brother for accountability; Titus exploited no one; the whole team moved under the same Spirit and lived the same example. The verse reassures believers that genuine gospel ministry is transparent, Spirit-led, and marked by consistent, Christ-like conduct.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the brother.</span> The Greek has the article, and he refers definitely to the first of the two unnamed brethren alluded to in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/8-18.htm" title="And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;">2Corinthians 8:18-22</a>. The Greek idiom of what is known as the "epistolary aorist," hinders the English reader from seeing that St. Paul is referring to what was being done at the time when the letter was written. It would accordingly be better rendered, <span class= "ital">I have besought Titus to go; I am sending the brother with him.</span> The ungenerous suspicions of some of the Corinthians had made him almost morbidly sensitive, and he repeats practically what he had said before (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/8-20.htm" title="Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:">2Corinthians 8:20-21</a>), that his motive in sending these delegates was to guard against them. Having stated this, he can appeal to their past knowledge of Titus, as a guarantee for the future. Had he "sponged" on any man, or tried what he could get out of him? Had he not identified himself with the Apostle, both in the general spirit which animated him and in the details of his daily life? It is a natural inference from this that Titus also had worked for his own maintenance and lived in his own lodging. If we may assume the identity of Titus with the Justus into whose house St. Paul went when he left the synagogue at Corinth (see Note on <a href="/acts/18-7.htm" title="And he departed there, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.">Acts 18:7</a>), the appeal to the knowledge which the Corinthians had of him gains a new significance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Titus</span>.
