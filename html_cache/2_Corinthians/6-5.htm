Beatings were a common form of punishment in the Roman world, often used to maintain order and discipline. Paul endured such beatings as a testament to his commitment to spreading the Gospel, as seen in <a href="/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22-23</a>, where he and Silas were beaten and imprisoned in Philippi. This reflects the suffering of Christ, who was also beaten before His crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-26.htm">Matthew 27:26</a>).<p><b>imprisonments</b><br>Paul's imprisonments were numerous and significant in his ministry. They provided him with opportunities to write several epistles, including Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon, known as the Prison Epistles. His time in prison also allowed him to witness to guards and fellow prisoners, as seen in <a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25-34</a>. Imprisonment was a common consequence for early Christians who defied Roman religious norms, highlighting the cost of discipleship.<p><b>and riots</b><br>Riots often erupted in response to Paul's preaching, as his message challenged both Jewish and pagan beliefs. In <a href="/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23-41</a>, a riot in Ephesus was incited by silversmiths who feared the loss of income from the sale of idols. Such disturbances underscore the transformative and sometimes disruptive power of the Gospel, which often provoked strong reactions from those whose livelihoods or beliefs were threatened.<p><b>in labor</b><br>Paul's ministry was marked by hard work, both in preaching and in supporting himself financially. He often worked as a tentmaker (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>) to avoid being a financial burden to the churches he served. This labor reflects the biblical principle of diligence and self-sufficiency, as well as Paul's commitment to the integrity of his ministry (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>).<p><b>sleepless nights</b><br>Paul experienced many sleepless nights, likely due to travel, concern for the churches, and the demands of his ministry. This phrase captures the physical and emotional toll of his apostolic work. It echoes the vigilance and dedication required of believers, as seen in Jesus' own sleepless night in prayer before His crucifixion (<a href="/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39-46</a>).<p><b>and hunger</b><br>Paul often faced hunger, either due to lack of resources or as a result of his missionary journeys. This experience of physical deprivation highlights his reliance on God's provision and his willingness to endure hardship for the sake of the Gospel. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of fasting and dependence on God, as seen in Jesus' fasting in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth, sharing his experiences and hardships as a servant of Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality, where Paul established a church and to whom he is addressing this letter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/beatings.htm">Beatings</a></b><br>Refers to the physical punishment Paul endured for preaching the Gospel, a common experience for early Christians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/imprisonments.htm">Imprisonments</a></b><br>Paul was frequently imprisoned for his faith, highlighting the cost of discipleship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/riots.htm">Riots</a></b><br>Paul often faced public disorder and opposition, as seen in various accounts in the Acts of the Apostles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_in_suffering.htm">Endurance in Suffering</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s experiences teach us the importance of enduring hardships for the sake of the Gospel.

"Tumults" (the same word as in <a href="/luke/21-9.htm" title="But when you shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.">Luke 21:9</a>) at Antioch in Pisidia (<a href="/acts/13-50.htm" title="But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.">Acts 13:50</a>), Lystra (<a href="/context/acts/14-5.htm" title="And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them spitefully, and to stone them,">Acts 14:5-19</a>), Thessalonica (<a href="/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5</a>), Corinth itself (<a href="/acts/18-12.htm" title="And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,">Acts 18:12</a>), and Ephesus (<a href="/context/acts/19-23.htm" title="And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.">Acts 19:23-41</a>). "Labours" describe the usual tenor of his life, the daily work of his calling as a tent-maker, as well as that connected with his ministry. "Watchings" and "fastings" are, probably, both of them (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-27.htm" title="In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.">2Corinthians 11:27</a>) to be referred to voluntary acts--nights of vigil and self-imposed abstinence--rather than to privations incidental to his work. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In stripes</span> (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>). The stripes were of two kinds - from Jewish whips and Roman rods. But of the five scourgings with Jewish whips not one is mentioned in the Acts, and only one of the three scourgings with Roman rods (<a href="/acts/16-23.htm">Acts 16:23</a>). Nothing, therefore, is more clear than that the Acts only furnishes us with a fragmentary and incomplete record, in which, as we gather from the Epistles, either the agonies of St. Paul's lifelong martyrdom are for some reason intentionally minimized, or else (which is, perhaps, mere probable) St. Paul was, as his rule and habit, so reticent about his own sufferings in the cause of Christ that St. Luke was only vaguely, if at all, aware of many scenes of trial through which he had passed. <span class="cmt_word">In imprisonments.</span> St. Paul was frequently in prison, but St. Luke only tells us of one of these occasions (<a href="/acts/16-24.htm">Acts 16:24</a>) - at Philippi; the Roman imprisonment and that at Caesarea were <span class="accented">subsequent</span> to this Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">In tumults.</span> These were a normal incident of St. Paul's life, both up to this time and for years afterwards (<a href="/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>; <a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>; <a href="/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22</a>; <a href="/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4, 5</a>; <a href="/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>; <a href="/acts/19-28.htm">Acts 19:28, 29</a>; <a href="/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27-39</a>; <a href="/acts/22-22.htm">Acts 22:22, 23</a>; <a href="/acts/23-9.htm">Acts 23:9, 10</a>; <a href="/acts/27-42.htm">Acts 27:42</a>, etc.) The word <span class="accented">akatastasiai</span> might also mean "insecurities," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> homelessness, wanderings, uncertainties (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/4-11.htm">1 Corinthians 4:11</a>); but New Testament usage seems decisive in favour of the frowner meaning (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>; <a href="/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a>).

Hence he again refers to this in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-27.htm">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>. His "sleeplessness" was sometimes the necessary result of labours "night and day" (<a href="/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">In fastings.</span> St. Paul never inculcates the practice of voluntary fasting as a duty (for the reading in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a> is more than dubious); but it is probable that he found it personally useful at times (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2, 3</a>; <a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>; <a href="/acts/9-9.htm">Acts 9:9</a>).
