The "saints" here are the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem who were experiencing severe financial hardship. This collection was a significant effort by the early church to demonstrate unity and support across cultural and geographical boundaries. The term "service" indicates that this was not merely a financial transaction but a ministry, an act of worship and love. This collection is also mentioned in <a href="/1_corinthians/16.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1-4</a> and <a href="/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25-27</a>, highlighting its importance in Paul's ministry.<p><b>there is no need for me to write to you</b><br>Paul expresses confidence in the Corinthians' willingness and readiness to contribute to this cause. This confidence likely stems from their previous eagerness and commitment to participate, as mentioned in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-10.htm">2 Corinthians 8:10-11</a>. The phrase suggests that the Corinthians were already well-informed and motivated regarding the collection, possibly due to prior instructions or communications from Paul or his associates.

This word shows that he is continuing the same subject, and therefore excludes the supposition that this chapter is a separate letter or fragment. No doubt, however, the express mention of the collection after he has been practically writing about it through the whole of the last chapter looks as if he had been interrupted, or had left off dictating at the end of the last verse. Such breaks must often and necessarily have occurred in the dictation of the Epistles, and doubtless help to account for some of their phenomena. Perhaps, on reperusing the last paragraphs before resuming the subject he observed that, after all, he had not directly mentioned the contribution, and therefore explains that he thought it superfluous to do so. <span class="cmt_word">To the saints.</span> The poor Christians of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-4.htm">2 Corinthians 8:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Superfluous</span>.
