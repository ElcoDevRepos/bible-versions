The title "Son of God" is significant in both Old and New Testament contexts, indicating Jesus' unique relationship with the Father (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). It underscores His authority and mission, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<p><b>who was proclaimed among you</b><br>Paul emphasizes the preaching of Jesus Christ to the Corinthians, highlighting the apostolic mission to spread the Gospel. This proclamation is rooted in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and reflects the early church's commitment to evangelism. The phrase suggests a personal and communal reception of the message, indicating the establishment of the Corinthian church through apostolic teaching.<p><b>by me and Silvanus and Timothy</b><br>Paul, Silvanus (Silas), and Timothy were key figures in the early church, working together to spread the Gospel.

This "Yes" signifies the assurance and fulfillment of God's covenantal promises through Jesus, who is the ultimate "Amen" to God's plan (<a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>).
