His role as a "partner and fellow worker" highlights the collaborative nature of Paul's ministry. This partnership is reminiscent of the early church's emphasis on teamwork, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-3</a>, where the Holy Spirit sets apart Barnabas and Saul for the work to which they were called. Titus's involvement in the Corinthian church underscores his leadership and reliability, as he was entrusted with delivering Paul's letters and managing sensitive church matters (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6-7, 13</a>-14). The term "fellow worker" indicates a shared mission in spreading the Gospel, reflecting the unity and cooperation among early Christian leaders.<p><b>As for our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.</b><br>The "brothers" mentioned here likely refer to other Christian leaders or delegates sent by the churches to assist in the collection for the Jerusalem church. The term "messengers" (Greek: apostoloi) suggests they were appointed representatives, similar to apostles, tasked with a specific mission. This practice of sending messengers was common in the early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>, where Judas and Silas were sent with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch. The phrase "the glory of Christ" signifies the honor and representation of Christ's presence and work through these individuals. Their role in the collection effort was not only practical but also spiritual, as they embodied the unity and generosity of the body of Christ, reflecting the glory of Christ in their service and dedication. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of believers being called to reflect Christ's glory, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A trusted companion and fellow worker of Paul, Titus played a significant role in the early church, particularly in Corinth.

To say that they were working only to that glory, though true, seems hardly adequate, and we gain a deeper thought by connecting it with the language of <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2Corinthians 3:18</a>.
