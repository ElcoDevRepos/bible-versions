The "brother" is not named, suggesting that his identity was well-known to the recipients or that his character was more important than his name. This reflects the early church's emphasis on community and shared mission, as seen in <a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>, where the apostles and elders sent Judas and Silas with Paul and Barnabas.<p><b>who has proven his earnestness to us many times and in many ways</b><br>The brother's earnestness, demonstrated repeatedly, highlights the importance of a consistent and reliable character in ministry. This echoes the biblical principle of faithfulness in small things leading to greater responsibilities (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>). The phrase suggests a history of service and dedication, aligning with the biblical value of perseverance and steadfastness in one's calling.<p><b>and now even more so by his great confidence in you</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the brother's growing confidence in the Corinthian church, likely due to their previous actions or reputation. It reflects the biblical theme of mutual encouragement and trust within the body of Christ, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>, which encourages believers to spur one another on toward love and good deeds.

Of the names connected with St. Paul at this period, that of Tychicus seems to have the greatest balance of probabilities in its favour. He went up with St. Paul to Jerusalem on this very business (<a href="/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>), and the tone in which the Apostle speaks of him in <a href="/ephesians/6-21.htm" title="But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:">Ephesians 6:21</a>, <a href="/colossians/4-7.htm" title=" All my state shall Tychicus declare to you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:">Colossians 4:7</a>, exactly agrees with his language here. In <a href="/2_timothy/4-12.htm" title="And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.">2Timothy 4:12</a>, <a href="/titus/3-12.htm" title="When I shall send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.">Titus 3:12</a>, we have further evidence of his being one of the most trusted of the couriers, or "messengers," of the Apostolic Church. The name of Clement has, however, I think, some claim to consideration. St. Paul refers to him as an active fellow-worker (<a href="/philippians/4-3.htm" title="And I entreat you also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life.">Philippians 4:3</a>). He was connected with the Philippians. Assuming his identity with Clement of Rome, this gives him a point of contact with the Church of Corinth, to which Clement addressed his Epistle. On the other hand, the distinction drawn in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-4.htm" title="Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, you) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.">2Corinthians 9:4</a> between these brethren and the Macedonians may seem to exclude Clement, as it has been thought to exclude Aristarchus and Sopater and Secundus. The word translated "diligent" ("earnest" in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-16.htm" title="But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.">2Corinthians 8:16</a>) is used by St. Paul only in this passage. It implies what we might almost call the "business-like" side of the Christian type of character, and is therefore employed with special fitness here. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our brother.</span> It is impossible to conjecture with any certainty who was the brother thus warmly eulogized. Clement, Epaenetus, Apollos, Luke, Zenas, Sosthenes, Trophimus, and Tychicus have all been suggested.
