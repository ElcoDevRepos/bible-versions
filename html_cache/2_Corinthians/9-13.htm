In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is referring to the collection for the Jerusalem church, which serves as a testament to the unity and love among believers. The "proof" is not just in words but in action, demonstrating the sincerity of their faith (<a href="/james/2-18.htm">James 2:18</a>). This act of giving is a practical expression of the gospel's transformative power, showing that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>).<p><b>The saints will glorify God</b><br>The term "saints" refers to the believers, particularly those in Jerusalem who are receiving the aid. The act of glorifying God is a central theme throughout Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/115.htm">Psalm 115:1</a> and <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>. The generosity of the Corinthians leads to thanksgiving and praise, fulfilling the purpose of good works as a testimony to God's grace and provision.<p><b>For your obedient confession of the gospel of Christ</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience in the Christian faith. The "confession of the gospel" implies a public declaration and living out of one's faith in Jesus Christ. Obedience is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, where Jesus says, "If you love me, keep my commands." The Corinthians' actions are a direct response to the gospel, showing that true faith results in obedience (<a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>).<p><b>And for the generosity of your contribution to them</b><br>Generosity is a hallmark of Christian living, reflecting the character of God who gives abundantly (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). The Corinthians' contribution is not just financial but also a symbol of their love and solidarity with the broader body of Christ. This act of giving is reminiscent of the early church's practice of sharing resources (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>), demonstrating the unity and mutual care among believers.<p><b>And to all the others</b><br>This phrase indicates that the impact of the Corinthians' generosity extends beyond the immediate recipients. It suggests a ripple effect, where their actions inspire and encourage others within the Christian community. This aligns with the principle found in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-14.htm">2 Corinthians 8:14</a>, where Paul speaks of equality and mutual support among churches. The broader implication is that acts of kindness and generosity have far-reaching effects, promoting unity and strengthening the church as a whole.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth regarding their generosity and the impact of their ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, encouraged to continue their generous support for the saints in Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_saints_in_jerusalem.htm">The Saints in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The beneficiaries of the Corinthian church's generosity, facing hardship and in need of support.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate recipient of glory through the obedience and generosity of believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gospel_of_christ.htm">The Gospel of Christ</a></b><br>The message of salvation and the foundation for the Corinthians' obedience and generosity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_the_gospel.htm">Obedience to the Gospel</a></b><br>Our actions should reflect our commitment to the teachings of Christ.
