This hyperbolic language underscores the gravity of the situation and the generosity of the Macedonian churches, such as those in Philippi and Thessalonica (<a href="/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15-16</a>). The term highlights the selflessness of these churches, which were not wealthy but gave out of their poverty (<a href="/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1-2</a>). This phrase also reflects Paul's commitment to not burden the Corinthians financially, maintaining his integrity and independence in ministry (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>).<p><b>by accepting their support</b><br>Paul accepted financial aid from other churches to sustain his mission work. This support was crucial for his ministry, allowing him to focus on preaching the Gospel without being a financial burden to the Corinthians. The Macedonian churches' support is a testament to their partnership in the Gospel (<a href="/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>). This practice of receiving support from other churches is consistent with the early Christian community's values of sharing resources and supporting one another (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>).<p><b>in order to serve you</b><br>Paul's primary goal was to serve the Corinthians by preaching the Gospel freely. His dedication to serving them without charge was to prevent any hindrance to the Gospel message (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-18.htm">1 Corinthians 9:18</a>). This service reflects the model of Christ, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). Paul's actions demonstrate his pastoral care and commitment to the spiritual well-being of the Corinthian church, ensuring that financial issues did not become a stumbling block to their faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth.

By calling this &#8220;robbery,&#8221; he underscores how deeply he feels the debt of gratitude he owes them.<p>&#8226; He is not endorsing literal theft; his life testifies to financial integrity (<a href="/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33-35</a>).<p>&#8226; The expression exposes the sharp contrast between genuine apostleship and the money-focused &#8220;super-apostles&#8221; troubling Corinth (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-12.htm">2 Corinthians 11:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by accepting their support</b><p>Receiving gifts is a legitimate right for gospel workers (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-11.htm">1 Corinthians 9:11-14</a>), yet Paul handled that right carefully.<p>&#8226;

The same principle still stands: believers share resources so that the Word spreads (<a href="/philippians/4-17.htm">Philippians 4:17-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in order to serve you</b><p>Paul&#8217;s financial strategy had one aim: maximize ministry in Corinth without casting a shadow of greed.<p>&#8226;

The vivid phrase &#8220;I robbed other churches&#8221; magnifies his gratitude to those donors and his protective love for a congregation easily swayed by flashy pretenders. It calls today&#8217;s church to the same blend of generous giving, responsible receiving, and self-emptying service that mirrors the Savior Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">I robbed other churches, taking wages of them.</span>--The word for wages--strictly <span class= "ital">rations,</span> or wages in kind, rather than in money--is found in <a href="/luke/3-14.htm" title="And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do?

Its use in the last-named passage had, perhaps, given occasion for a sneer. "He too can take wages when it suits his purpose." From St. Paul's point of view, if what he had received had been wages at all, he had been guilty of an act of spoliation.
