This confidence is not based on human wisdom but on the grace and promises of God. In the broader context of 2 Corinthians, Paul often defends his apostolic authority and sincerity, emphasizing his reliance on God (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>). This confidence is also seen in his previous letters, where he trusts in the work of the Holy Spirit among the believers (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><b>I planned to visit you first</b><br>Paul's intention to visit the Corinthians first indicates his desire to prioritize them in his missionary journey. This reflects the importance of the Corinthian church in his ministry. Historically, Corinth was a major city in Greece, known for its commerce and diverse population, making it a strategic location for spreading the Gospel. Paul's travel plans, as seen in Acts and his epistles, often involved revisiting churches to strengthen and encourage them (<a href="/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36</a>).<p><b>so that you might receive a double blessing</b><br>The "double blessing" refers to the spiritual benefits the Corinthians would gain from Paul's visit. This could mean both the initial visit and a subsequent one, or the blessings of his presence and teaching. In Jewish culture, a double portion often signifies a special inheritance or favor (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>). Spiritually, Paul&#8217;s presence would bring encouragement, correction, and deeper teaching, enhancing their faith and unity. This concept of blessing is consistent with Paul's desire for the churches to grow in grace and knowledge (<a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians.

It was because he trusted that they would judge him rightly that he had done that which had led some to judge him wrongly. His plan had been at first to go straight by sea from Ephesus to Corinth, then to pass on to Macedonia, thence to return to Corinth, and thence set sail for Jerusalem. When he wrote <a href="/context/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" title="Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.">1Corinthians 16:5-6</a>, he had already modified his plan by deciding to go to Macedonia first. His original scheme had shown his wish to see as much of the Corinthians as possible. They were to have two visits ("a second <span class= "ital">favour"</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and not one only. Had he shown less regard, he asks, in the change with which he had been taunted?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-22.</span> <span class="accented">- His change of purpose in visiting Corinth</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this confidence.</span> In reliance on the mutual respect and affection which exists between us. <span class="cmt_word">I was minded.</span> The stress is partly on the tense: "my original desire <span class="accented">was</span>." When speaking of matters purely personal, St. Paul generally reverts to the first person. <span class="cmt_word">To come unto you before.</span> I meant to visit you, first on my way to Macedonia, and again on my return from Macedonia, as explained in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">A second benefit;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a second grace</span>. There is another reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>, joy, and the word <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> itself sometimes has this sense (as in Tobit 7:18), but not in the New Testament. Here, again, there is no boastfulness. St. Paul, filled as he was with the power of the Holy Spirit, was able to impart to his converts some spiritual gifts (<a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>), and this was the chief reason why his visits were so eagerly desired, and why his change of plan had caused such bitter disappointment to the Corinthians. The importance of the Church of Corinth, its central position, and its unsettled state made it desirable that he should give them as much as possible of his personal supervision. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/1-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Confident</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#952;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(pepoith&#275;sei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4006.htm">Strong's 4006: </a> </span><span class="str2">Confidence, trust, reliance.
