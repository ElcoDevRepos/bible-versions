In the context of <a href="/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8</a>, Paul is discussing the collection for the saints in Jerusalem. The phrase suggests that the following information is of significant importance, building upon the trust and integrity already established.<p><b>this brother</b><br>The identity of "this brother" is not explicitly mentioned, but he is likely a well-respected figure within the early Christian community. The anonymity may emphasize the collective effort and unity of the church rather than individual recognition. This reflects the early church's emphasis on communal responsibility and shared mission.<p><b>was chosen by the churches</b><br>The selection by the churches indicates a democratic process and communal decision-making, highlighting the early church's practice of involving multiple congregations in significant decisions. This also underscores the trust and accountability within the body of believers, as the chosen individual would represent the collective interests of the churches.<p><b>to accompany us</b><br>The presence of a companion for Paul and his associates in delivering the offering underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in handling financial matters. This practice is consistent with Jewish customs of having multiple witnesses to ensure integrity, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>.<p><b>with the gracious offering</b><br>The term "gracious offering" refers to the collection being gathered for the impoverished believers in Jerusalem. This act of giving is seen as an expression of grace, reflecting the generosity and love that should characterize Christian communities. It aligns with the biblical principle of supporting fellow believers, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>.<p><b>we administer</b><br>Paul and his companions are responsible for overseeing the collection and distribution of the offering. This administration is not just a logistical task but a spiritual duty, reflecting the stewardship entrusted to them by God and the churches. It highlights the role of church leaders in managing resources for the benefit of the community.<p><b>to honor the Lord Himself</b><br>The ultimate purpose of the offering is to glorify God. This aligns with the biblical teaching that all actions, including giving, should be done for the glory of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). It reflects the understanding that acts of charity and support for others are acts of worship and service to God.<p><b>and to show our eagerness to help</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the willingness and enthusiasm of the early Christians to support their fellow believers. It reflects the spirit of generosity and compassion that is encouraged throughout the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>. The eagerness to help is a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel in fostering love and unity among believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is writing to the Corinthians, discussing the collection for the saints in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A trusted companion of Paul, who is involved in the administration of the collection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_churches.htm">The Churches</a></b><br>Refers to the various congregations that have contributed to the collection and have chosen representatives to accompany Paul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gift.htm">The Gift</a></b><br>The financial collection being gathered for the impoverished believers in Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The destination of the collection, where the saints are in need of support.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_accountability.htm">The Importance of Accountability</a></b><br>The churches chose representatives to accompany Paul, ensuring transparency and integrity in handling the collection.

He is not merely repeating himself; he is adding weight. In <a href="/2_corinthians/8-17.htm">2 Corinthians 8:17&#8211;18</a> he noted Titus&#8217;s zeal and another brother&#8217;s fame in the gospel; now he layers on further assurance. Just as in <a href="/philippians/3-1.htm">Philippians 3:1</a>, he piles truth upon truth so the Corinthians will have full confidence in this collection effort.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This brother</b><p>Paul does not name the man, but his reputation in the gospel is well-known (v. 18). Much like Barnabas in <a href="/acts/11-24.htm">Acts 11:24</a>, this unnamed brother is recognized for integrity and faithfulness, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/22-1.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;A good name is more desirable than great riches.&#8221; His anonymity keeps the focus on Christ rather than on personalities (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was chosen by the churches</b><p>The selection came from multiple congregations, not from Paul alone. This mirrors <a href="/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>, where the Jerusalem church chose seven men to handle funds fairly. By involving various churches, Paul upholds the principle of corporate discernment (<a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>) and shields himself from any accusation of mishandling money (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-20.htm">2 Corinthians 8:20&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To accompany us</b><p>The brother will travel with Paul and his team, ensuring transparency on the journey. In <a href="/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>, Jesus sent disciples out two by two; here Paul follows the same wisdom. Having companions safeguards against temptation and provides eyewitness validation of faithful stewardship (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With the gracious offering</b><p>The &#8220;gracious offering&#8221; refers to the monetary gift for the impoverished believers in Jerusalem (<a href="/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25&#8211;27</a>). Paul calls it &#8220;gracious&#8221; (charis) because it flows from God&#8217;s grace working in the Macedonians and Corinthians (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1</a>). Giving is an extension of grace, echoing Jesus&#8217; teaching in <a href="/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>&#8212;&#8220;Freely you have received; freely give.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We administer</b><p>Paul sees himself and his coworkers as administrators, not owners (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1&#8211;2</a>). Their role is stewardship. Like Joseph overseeing Egypt&#8217;s grain (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41</a>), Paul manages the funds for the benefit of others, conscious that &#8220;it is required of stewards that they be found faithful&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To honor the Lord Himself</b><p>The ultimate aim is worship, not financial relief alone. <a href="/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a> captures the heart: &#8220;Not to us, O LORD, but to Your name be the glory.&#8221; By channeling gifts to needy saints, believers glorify Christ, who said, &#8220;Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>). The offering is a tangible act of honoring the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And to show our eagerness to help</b><p>Generosity proves sincere love (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-8.htm">2 Corinthians 8:8</a>).

A respected brother, chosen by multiple churches, travels with Paul to manage the gracious offering. The purpose is twofold: to honor the Lord and to demonstrate earnest love for fellow believers.
