In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is discussing the collection for the saints in Jerusalem. The "he" refers to Titus, who was a trusted companion of Paul. The appeal likely involved encouraging the Corinthian church to participate in the collection. This reflects the early church's practice of mutual support and charity, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where believers shared their possessions. Titus's willingness to respond positively underscores the importance of leadership and cooperation in the early church.<p><b>but he is eagerly coming to you</b><br>Titus's eagerness to visit the Corinthians demonstrates his commitment and enthusiasm for the ministry. This eagerness is a model of Christian service, reflecting the attitude of Christ, who came to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). The word "eagerly" suggests a readiness and willingness that goes beyond mere obligation, highlighting the joy and dedication that should characterize Christian ministry. This eagerness also serves to reassure the Corinthians of Titus's genuine care and concern for their spiritual well-being.<p><b>of his own volition</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that Titus's actions were voluntary and not coerced. It highlights the principle of willing service in the Christian life, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where Paul states that God loves a cheerful giver. Titus's voluntary decision to go to Corinth reflects the freedom and personal responsibility that believers have in serving God. This autonomy in service is a reflection of the work of the Holy Spirit, who empowers and guides believers to act according to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians, encouraging them in their faith and in their acts of generosity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>- A trusted companion of Paul, who is mentioned in this verse as someone who eagerly accepted the task of visiting the Corinthians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>- The city where the church receiving this letter is located, known for its diverse culture and challenges in maintaining Christian values.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_appeal.htm">The Appeal</a></b><br>- Refers to the request made by Paul and his companions for the Corinthians to participate in the collection for the Jerusalem church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_collection_for_the_saints.htm">The Collection for the Saints</a></b><br>- An event where Paul organized a collection to support the impoverished church in Jerusalem, demonstrating unity and love among the early Christians.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/eagerness_in_service.htm">Eagerness in Service</a></b><br>Titus's willingness to go to Corinth demonstrates the importance of being eager and proactive in serving others.
