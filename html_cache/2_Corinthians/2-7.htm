In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the issue of a member of the church who has sinned and faced disciplinary action. The call to forgive reflects the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized forgiveness in passages like <a href="/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14-15</a>. Comforting the individual aligns with the role of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>), suggesting that believers should emulate this aspect of God's character. The cultural context of the early church involved a strong sense of community, where reconciliation was vital for maintaining unity and witness to the surrounding society.<p><b>so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow</b><br>This phrase highlights the potential consequences of failing to forgive and comfort. Excessive sorrow can lead to despair, which is contrary to the hope offered in Christ. The historical context of the Corinthian church involved dealing with issues of immorality and division, as seen in 1 Corinthians. Paul&#8217;s concern is pastoral, aiming to restore the individual to fellowship and prevent spiritual harm. This reflects the broader biblical theme of restoration, as seen in the parable of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>), where the father's forgiveness leads to the son's restoration. Theologically, it underscores the balance between justice and mercy, a theme central to the character of God throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on how to handle a situation involving a repentant sinner.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Corinth dealing with issues of sin and forgiveness within their congregation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offender.htm">The Offender</a></b><br>An unnamed individual in the Corinthian church who had sinned and was subject to church discipline, now seeking forgiveness and restoration.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and moral challenges, which influenced the issues faced by the church there.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/forgiveness_and_comfort.htm">Forgiveness and Comfort</a></b><br>Key themes in this passage, emphasizing the need for the church to extend grace and support to the repentant sinner.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_forgiveness.htm">The Necessity of Forgiveness</a></b><br>Forgiveness is not optional for Christians; it is a command.

Discipline had served its purpose, so &#8220;instead&#8221; marks a deliberate pivot from confrontation to restoration. The apostle redirects the congregation&#8217;s energy away from exclusion toward reconciliation, much like Jesus&#8217; instruction in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15&#8211;17</a> that discipline always aims at winning the brother back.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you ought to forgive</b><p>Forgiveness is not hinted at&#8212;it is commanded. The church &#8220;ought&#8221; to forgive, reflecting our obligation as people forgiven by God (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>). Forgiveness here is practical and public, releasing the offender from the penalty of exclusion and affirming his repentance (<a href="/luke/17-3.htm">Luke 17:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and comfort him</b><p>Forgiveness alone is incomplete without comfort.

Continued censure after repentance can &#8220;overwhelm,&#8221; or swallow up, a believer.

David felt crushing remorse after his sin (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3&#8211;4</a>) until forgiveness brought relief (<a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>).

The time had come for words of pardon and comfort and counsel. What if he should be "swallowed up," and sink as in the great deep of sorrow? Suicide, madness, apostasy, seem to float before his mind as but too possible results.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Contrariwise</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> contrary to the line taken or to the view expressed by the severer portion of the community. <span class="cmt_word">Rather</span>. The word is omitted in A and B. <span class="cmt_word">To forgive him</span>. The word is used of the mutual attitude of gracious forbearance which ought to exist among Christians(Forgiving one another," <a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>), so that they might be not only Christians, but as Gentiles ignorantly called them, <span class="accented">Chrestians</span> (" kind-hearted," Ephesians 4:82). <span class="cmt_word">And comfort</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "strengthen," "encourage."

In <a href="/galatians/6-11.htm">Galatians 6:11</a> St. Paul suddenly breaks off the course of his remarks to give similar advice in a tone of peculiar solemnity; and in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a> he warns against any <span class="accented">excess</span> in the severity which he enjoins in the previous verse. <span class="cmt_word">Such a one</span>.
