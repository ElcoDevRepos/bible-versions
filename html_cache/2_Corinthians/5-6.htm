The confidence mentioned here is rooted in the promises of God and the work of Christ. This confidence is not based on human strength but on faith in God's faithfulness. The Apostle Paul often speaks of confidence in his letters, emphasizing the assurance believers have in their salvation and future hope (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-35.htm">Hebrews 10:35</a>).<p><b>Although we know that while we are at home in the body</b><br>The phrase "at home in the body" refers to the current physical existence of believers. Paul acknowledges the reality of living in a fallen world, where the body is subject to decay and sin. This earthly life is temporary, and believers are called to live by faith, not by sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). The body is often described as a tent, a temporary dwelling, contrasting with the eternal home in heaven (<a href="/2_corinthians/5.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>).<p><b>We are away from the Lord</b><br>Being "away from the Lord" highlights the tension between the present physical life and the future spiritual reality. While believers have the Holy Spirit as a guarantee of their inheritance (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>), they are not yet in the full presence of the Lord. This separation is not a spiritual absence, as Christ is with believers through the Spirit, but rather a physical absence from the direct presence of God. The longing for this future union is a recurring theme in Paul's writings, reflecting the hope of eternal life and the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises (<a href="/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>, <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality, where Paul established a church during his missionary journeys.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of this letter, they were a diverse group of believers facing various challenges, including issues of morality and doctrinal confusion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_body.htm">The Body</a></b><br>Refers to the physical human body, which Paul describes as a temporary dwelling place for believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, with whom believers long to be united in eternity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/confidence_in_faith.htm">Confidence in Faith</a></b><br>Believers can have confidence in their faith, knowing that their current physical existence is temporary and that their true home is with the Lord.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_eternal_perspective.htm">Living with Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Understanding that we are "away from the Lord" while in the body encourages us to live with an eternal perspective, prioritizing spiritual growth and heavenly treasures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_temporary_nature_of_earthly_life.htm">The Temporary Nature of Earthly Life</a></b><br>Recognizing the temporary nature of our earthly bodies should motivate us to focus on what is eternal and to live in a way that honors God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_trials.htm">Encouragement in Trials</a></b><br>This verse offers encouragement during trials, reminding us that our current struggles are temporary and that we have a future hope in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_faith.htm">Active Faith</a></b><br>While we are "at home in the body," we are called to actively live out our faith, serving others and sharing the gospel, knowing that our ultimate goal is to be with the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Corinthians_5_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Corinthians 5:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_2_Cor_5_6_inspire_daily_faith.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 5:6 encourage us to live by faith daily?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_away_from_the_body_mean.htm">What does "away from the body" mean in the context of this verse?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_at_home_with_the_Lord_daily.htm">How can we apply "at home with the Lord" to our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Which_scriptures_stress_faith_over_sight.htm">What other scriptures emphasize living by faith and not by sight?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/2_Cor_5_6_s_impact_on_facing_challenges.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 5:6 influence our perspective on earthly challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Implication_of_confidence_in_adversity.htm">What does "we are always confident" in 2 Corinthians 5:6 imply about Christian faith in adversity?

The two verbs for being "at home" and "absent" are not found elsewhere in the New Testament. The latter conveys the special idea of being absent from a man's own home or country.
