In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is defending his apostolic authority against accusations from false apostles. This phrase indicates his desire to clarify his motives and ensure that his actions are not misunderstood. The Greek word used here for "seem" (doke&#333;) can imply appearance or reputation, suggesting Paul is concerned about how his actions are perceived by the Corinthian church.<p><b>to be trying to frighten you</b><br>Paul's letters, particularly 1 Corinthians, contained strong rebukes and corrections. His intention was not to instill fear but to guide and correct the church in love. The cultural context of the time valued rhetoric and persuasive speech, and Paul was aware that his written words might be perceived as harsh or intimidating. His goal was to encourage repentance and spiritual growth, not to cause fear or anxiety.<p><b>by my letters</b><br>Paul's letters were a primary means of communication with the early churches he established. These letters were authoritative and carried the weight of his apostolic authority. In <a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>, Paul acknowledges that some considered his letters "weighty and forceful," contrasting with his physical presence, which was described as "unimpressive." This highlights the tension between written communication and personal presence in the early church. The letters were intended to instruct, correct, and build up the church, aligning with the broader scriptural theme of God using written revelation to communicate His will, as seen throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the Corinthian church.

Earlier, a &#8220;severe letter&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8&#8211;9</a>) had produced repentance; now he assures them his aim has never been intimidation.<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s defense echoes <a href="/2_corinthians/1-17.htm">2 Corinthians 1:17&#8211;18</a>, underscoring that both his words and actions flow from the same God-given integrity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I do not want to seem&#8221;</b><p>Paul guards not only what he says but how it appears.<p>&#8226;
