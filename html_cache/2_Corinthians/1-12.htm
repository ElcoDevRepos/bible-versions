In the Greco-Roman world, boasting was often associated with pride and arrogance. However, Paul redefines boasting as a form of confidence in what God has done through him. This is consistent with <a href="/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a>, where boasting is in understanding and knowing God.<p><b>Our conscience testifies:</b><br>The conscience is an inner sense of right and wrong, which Paul often refers to in his letters (<a href="/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5</a>). Here, Paul emphasizes the importance of a clear conscience, which aligns with the biblical principle of integrity and transparency before God and others.<p><b>that we have conducted ourselves in the world:</b><br>Paul speaks of his conduct, which is a recurring theme in his epistles (<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a>). His behavior in the world reflects his commitment to living out the gospel. The "world" here refers to the broader society, emphasizing the importance of Christian witness in everyday life.<p><b>and especially in relation to you:</b><br>Paul highlights his relationship with the Corinthian church, which was complex and fraught with challenges. This phrase underscores the personal nature of his ministry and his deep concern for the spiritual well-being of the Corinthians, as seen throughout 1 and 2 Corinthians.<p><b>in the holiness and sincerity that are from God:</b><br>Holiness and sincerity are attributes that Paul attributes to divine origin. Holiness is a key biblical concept, reflecting God's nature and the call for believers to be set apart (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). Sincerity, or purity of motive, is essential for genuine Christian living (<a href="/philippians/1-10.htm">Philippians 1:10</a>).<p><b>not in worldly wisdom:</b><br>Paul contrasts divine wisdom with worldly wisdom, a theme he explores in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18-25</a>. Worldly wisdom often relies on human reasoning and philosophy, which can be contrary to God's truth. Paul warns against relying on such wisdom, which can lead to pride and division.<p><b>but in the grace of God:</b><br>Grace is central to Paul's theology, representing God's unmerited favor and empowerment for living a godly life (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). By attributing his conduct to God's grace, Paul acknowledges that any success in his ministry is due to God's work in and through him, not his own abilities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians, defending his conduct and ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a community of believers facing various challenges and misunderstandings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The source of holiness and sincerity, as opposed to worldly wisdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/world.htm">World</a></b><br>The broader context in which Paul and the Corinthians live, often characterized by values contrary to those of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_sincerity.htm">Holiness and Sincerity</a></b><br>As believers, our conduct should reflect the holiness and sincerity that come from God.

Paul is not bragging in a self-centered way; rather, he is rejoicing in what God has done through a clean walk. Similar godly rejoicing appears in <a href="/romans/15-17.htm">Romans 15:17</a>, where Paul says, &#8220;Therefore I exult in Christ Jesus in my service to God,&#8221; and in <a href="/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a>, &#8220;May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; The point: any legitimate boasting is a celebration of God&#8217;s work, not personal glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Our conscience testifies</b><p>&#8220;Our conscience testifies&#8221; underscores an inner witness.

This matches his earlier declaration in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a>: &#8220;You are witnesses, and so is God, of how devoutly, righteously, and blamelessly we conducted ourselves toward you who believe.&#8221; Integrity is never limited to public ministry; it permeates every environment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the holiness and sincerity that are from God</b><p>&#8220;Holiness and sincerity&#8221; signal set-apart living and transparency, gifts &#8220;from God.&#8221; <a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a> calls believers to &#8220;put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.&#8221; <a href="/philippians/1-10.htm">Philippians 1:10</a> desires believers to &#8220;be pure and blameless.&#8221; Such qualities are supernatural, not self-manufactured, reflecting the indwelling Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Not in worldly wisdom</b><p>Paul explicitly rules out human cleverness, reminiscent of <a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4-5</a>: &#8220;My message and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit&#8217;s power.&#8221; <a href="/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14-17</a> contrasts earthly wisdom&#8212;marked by envy and selfish ambition&#8212;with wisdom from above, pure and peace-loving.

The verse invites believers to the same transparent walk: letting grace govern conduct, boasting only in what God accomplishes, and maintaining a conscience kept clean before Him and others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">For our rejoicing is this. . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">our boast,</span> as in <a href="/romans/3-17.htm" title="And the way of peace have they not known:">Romans 3:17</a>; <a href="/romans/15-17.htm" title="I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.">Romans 15:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-31.htm" title="I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.">1Corinthians 15:31</a>. With the feeling of jubilant thankfulness which has hitherto characterised his language there mingles another of a different character. It had, perhaps, been in the background of his thoughts all along. He had seemed, in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1Corinthians 4:21</a>, to imply that he was coming to take strong measures against evil-doers ("Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love?"). In <a href="/context/1_corinthians/16-2.htm" title="On the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God has prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.">1Corinthians 16:2-8</a> he had spoken yet more definitely, "I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia." And yet he had not come. Titus would seem to have told him what was said of this: "He was fickle, and changeable; said Yes one day, and No another. Perhaps he was afraid to come." He is eager to refute the charge without a formal pleading as in answer to it, and seems to cast about for an opening. He finds it in the words which he had just dictated. He has a right to assume that the Corinthians will pray and give thanks for him, for he can boast that he has never failed, conscience bearing him witness, in transparent sincerity to them.<p><span class= "bld">The testimony of our conscience.</span>--The words present an obviously undesigned coincidence with St. Paul's language in <a href="/acts/23-1.htm" title="And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a>, and again with that of <a href="/romans/9-1.htm" title="I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,">Romans 9:1</a>.

The fact that, in spite of all his exceptional care, such bitter taunts could still be levelled at him, shows that he had not been mistaken in supposing that no Church required from him a more anxious watchfulness over all his conduct. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
