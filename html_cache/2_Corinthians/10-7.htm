In the Greco-Roman world, outward appearances, such as eloquence and physical presence, were often valued over inner character. This mirrors the biblical theme found in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God reminds Samuel that He looks at the heart, not the outward appearance. The Corinthian church was influenced by cultural norms that prioritized external success and charisma, which Paul challenges by emphasizing spiritual authenticity and integrity.<p><b>If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ,</b><br>Paul is addressing those in the Corinthian church who claim a special relationship with Christ, possibly due to their association with certain leaders or their own perceived spiritual superiority. This reflects the broader issue of division within the church, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12-13</a>, where Paul rebukes the Corinthians for aligning themselves with different apostles. The phrase underscores the importance of humility and self-examination in one's relationship with Christ, as true confidence in belonging to Christ should be rooted in faith and obedience, not in external affiliations or achievements.<p><b>he should remind himself that we belong to Christ just as much as he does.</b><br>Paul asserts the equality of all believers in Christ, countering any claims of superiority or exclusivity. This echoes <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul declares that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for all are one in Christ Jesus. The phrase emphasizes the unity of the body of Christ and the shared identity of all believers, regardless of their background or status. It serves as a reminder that spiritual authority and belonging are not determined by human standards but by one's relationship with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

Yet Scripture insists that the Lord &#8220;does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus echoed this when He urged, &#8220;Stop judging by outward appearances, and start judging justly&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-24.htm">John 7:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul had already told the Corinthians, &#8220;We are not commending ourselves&#8230; but giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those who take pride in appearance rather than in the heart&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-12.htm">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>).<p>Outward impressions are a shaky foundation for spiritual evaluation; the true measure is faithfulness to Christ and the display of His power (2 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 10</a>:3-6).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ</b><p>Paul continues, &#8220;If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ&#8230;&#8221; (2 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 10</a>:7b). Certain teachers in Corinth claimed a special status&#8212;perhaps boasting that they alone carried the badge of true apostleship (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-5.htm">2 Corinthians 11:5</a>). Paul does not deny the importance of belonging to Christ; rather, he embraces it.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a> states, &#8220;If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a> reminds the church, &#8220;And you are Christ&#8217;s, and Christ is God&#8217;s.&#8221;<p>Belonging to Christ is a glorious certainty for every believer, not a credential for spiritual elitism.

While Christ grants different roles&#8212;Paul&#8217;s apostolic authority is real and God-given (2 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 10</a>:8)&#8212;He never grants a monopoly on Himself.
