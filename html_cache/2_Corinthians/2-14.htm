It reflects the apostle's acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and grace. In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is expressing gratitude for the triumphs and victories that God provides, even amidst trials and challenges. This gratitude is rooted in the understanding that all good things come from God (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><b>who always leads us triumphantly as captives in Christ</b><br>The imagery here is of a Roman triumphal procession, where a victorious general would lead captives through the streets as a display of conquest. Paul uses this metaphor to describe believers as being led by Christ in a victory parade. This suggests that Christians, though once captives to sin, are now captives to Christ, sharing in His victory over sin and death. This aligns with the theme of victory found in <a href="/romans/8-37.htm">Romans 8:37</a>, where believers are described as "more than conquerors" through Christ.<p><b>and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of Him</b><br>The metaphor of fragrance is significant in biblical literature, often associated with sacrifices pleasing to God (<a href="/exodus/29-18.htm">Exodus 29:18</a>). Here, Paul uses it to describe the spread of the Gospel. The "fragrance" represents the knowledge of Christ, which is spread through the lives and testimonies of believers. This imagery is also found in <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>, where Christ's sacrificial love is described as a "fragrant offering."

We have to find its source, not in what the Apostle had written or spoken, but in what was passing through his memory. He had met Titus, and that disciple had been as a courier bringing tidings of a victory. The love of God had won another triumph.<p><span class= "bld">Causeth us to</span> <span class= "bld">triumph.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">who always leads us in His triumph.</span> There is absolutely no authority for the factitive meaning given to the verb in the English version. In <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>, it is translated rightly, "triumphing over them in it." It is obvious, too, that the true rendering gives a much more characteristic thought. It would be unlike St. Paul to speak of himself as the triumphant commander of God's great army. It is altogether like him that he should give God the glory, and own that He, as manifested in Christ, had triumphed, and that Apostle and penitent, the faithful and the rebellious, alike took their place in the procession of that triumph.<p>The imagery that follows is clearly that of the solemn triumphal procession of a Roman emperor or general. St. Paul, who had not as yet been at Rome, where only such triumphs were celebrated, had, therefore, never seen them, and was writing accordingly from what he had heard from others. Either from the Roman Jews whom he had met at Corinth, many of them slaves or freed-men in the imperial household, or the Roman soldiers and others with whom he came in contact at Philippi, possibly from St. Luke or Clement, he had heard how the conqueror rode along the Via Sacra in his chariot, followed by his troops and prisoners, captive kings and princes, and trophies of victory; how fragrant clouds of incense accompanied his march, rising from fixed altars or wafted from censers; how, at the foot of the Capitoline hill, some of the prisoners, condemned as treacherous or rebellious, were led off to execution, or thrown into the dungeons of the Mamer-tine prison, while others were pardoned and set free. It is not without interest to remember that when St. Paul wrote, the latest triumph at Rome had been that solemnised at Rome by Claudius in honour of the victory of Ostorius over the Britons in A.D. 51, and commemorated by a triumphal arch, the inscription on which is now to be seen in the court-yard of the Barberini Palace at Rome; that in that triumph Caractacus had figured as a prisoner; and that he and his children, spared by the mercy of the emperor, had passed from the ranks of the "lost" to those of the "saved" (Tacit. <span class= "ital">Ann.</span> xiii. 36). According to a view taken by some writers, Claudia and Linus (<a href="/2_timothy/4-21.htm" title="Do your diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers.">2Timothy 4:21</a>) were among those children. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus on the Later Years of St. Paul's Life,</span> at the close of the Acts of the Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">The savour of his knowledge.</span>--There is obviously a reference to the incense which, as in the above description, was an essential part of the triumph of a Roman general. It is there that St. Paul finds an analogue of his own work. He claims to be, as it were, a <span class= "ital">thurifer,</span> an incense-bearer, in the procession of the conqueror. Words, whether of prayer or praise, thanksgiving or preaching, what were they but as incense-clouds bearing to all around, as they were wafted in the air, the tidings that the Conqueror had come? The "savour of his knowledge" is probably "the knowledge <span class= "ital">of Him:</span>" that which rests in Him as its object.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now thanks be unto God.</span> The whole of this Epistle is the apostle's <span class="accented">Apologia pro vita sua</span>, and is more full of personal details and emotional expressions than any other Epistle. But nothing in it is more characteristic than this sudden outburst of thanksgiving into which he breaks so eagerly <span class="accented">that he has quite omitted to say what it was for which he so earnestly thanked God</span>. It is only when we come to <a href="/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5, 6</a> that we learn the circumstance which gave him such intense relief, namely, the arrival of Titus with good news from Corinth about the treatment of the offender and the manner in which the first letter had been received. It is true that this good news seems to have been dashed by other remarks of Titus which, perhaps, he withheld at first, and which may only have been drawn from him, almost against his will, by subsequent conversations. But, however checkered, the main and immediate intelligence was good, and the apostle so vividly recalls his sudden uplifting out of an abyss of anxiety and trouble (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>) that the mere remembrance of it awakens a thankfulness to God which can only find vent by immediate utterance. <span class="accented">Now thanks be unto God</span>. The order of the original is more forcible, "But to God be thanks." The remembrance of his own prostration calls into his mind the power and love of God. <span class="cmt_word">Which always causeth us to triumph;</span> rather, <span class="accented">who leadeth us in triumph</span>. The verb <span class="accented">thriambeuo</span> may undoubtedly have this meaning, on the analogy of <span class="accented">choreuo</span>, I cause to dance, <span class="accented">basileuo</span>, I cause to reign, etc.; and other neuter verbs which sometimes have a factitive scribe. But in <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a> St. Paul uses this word in the only sense in which it is actually found, "to <span class="accented">lead</span> in <span class="accented">triumph</span>;" and this sense seems both to suit the context better, and to be more in accordance with the habitual feelings of St. Paul (<a href="/galatians/6-17.htm">Galatians 6:17</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>), and especially those with which these Epistles were written (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-9.htm">1 Corinthians 4:9-13</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23</a>). St. Paul's feeling is, therefore, the exact opposite of that of the haughty Cleopatra who said, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f51;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "I will not be led in triumph." He rejoiced to be exhibited by God as a trophy in the triumphal procession of Christ. God, indeed, gave him the victory over the lower part of his nature (<a href="/romans/8-37.htm">Romans 8:37</a>), but this was no public triumph. The only victory of which he could boast was to have been utterly vanquished by God and taken prisoner "in Christ." <span class="cmt_word">The savour of his knowledge.</span> The mental vision of a Roman triumph summons up various images before the mind of St. Paul. He thinks of the streets breathing with the fragrance of incense offered upon many a wayside altar; of the tumult and rejoicing of the people; of the fame and glory of the conqueror; of the miserable captives led aside from the funeral procession to die, like Vercingetorix, in the <span class="accented">Tullianum</span> at the foot of the Capitoline hill. He touches on each of these incidents as they crowd upon him. The triumph of L. Mummius over the conquest of Corinth had been one of the most splendid which the Roman world had ever seen, and in A.D. , shortly before this Epistle was written (A.D. 57), Claudius had celebrated his triumph over the Britons and their king Caractacus, who had been led in the procession, but whose life had been spared (Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 13:36). <span class="accented">The savour of his knowledge</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the fragrance of the knowledge of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">By us.</span> The details of the metaphor are commingled, as is often the case in writers of quick feeling and imagination. Here the apostles are no longer the vanquished who are led in procession, but the spectators who burn and diffuse the fragrance of the incense<span class="cmt_word">. In every place.</span> Even at that early period, not twenty-five years after the Crucifixion, the gospel had been very widely preached in Asia and Europe (<a href="/romans/15-18.htm">Romans 15:18, 19</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">thanks [be]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#967;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(charis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5485.htm">Strong's 5485: </a> </span><span class="str2">From chairo; graciousness, of manner or act.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(T&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
