This reflects his role as an apostle who is responsible for guiding and correcting the church. The "second time" indicates that Paul had visited Corinth before, which is supported by <a href="/acts/18.htm">Acts 18:1-11</a>, where Paul first established the church. His warnings were likely about moral and doctrinal issues, as the Corinthian church was known for its struggles with immorality and division (<a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-13</a>). This phrase underscores the seriousness of Paul's message and his commitment to their spiritual well-being.<p><b>So now in my absence I warn those who sinned earlier and everyone else:</b><br>Paul's absence from Corinth does not diminish his authority or concern for the church. He addresses "those who sinned earlier," likely referring to individuals involved in specific sins that were previously addressed, such as sexual immorality or idolatry. The inclusion of "everyone else" broadens the warning to the entire congregation, emphasizing that no one is exempt from accountability. This reflects the biblical principle that the church is a community where each member is responsible for maintaining holiness (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). Paul's warning serves as a reminder of the need for repentance and adherence to Christian teachings.<p><b>If I return, I will not spare anyone,</b><br>Paul's statement is a stern warning of impending discipline if the Corinthians do not repent. The phrase "I will not spare anyone" indicates that Paul is prepared to take decisive action against unrepentant sin. This echoes the biblical theme of divine discipline, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>, where God disciplines those He loves. Paul's potential return to Corinth is not just a pastoral visit but a moment of accountability. This reflects the seriousness with which the early church viewed sin and the responsibility of leaders to address it. The phrase also highlights the apostolic authority Paul holds, as he acts as a representative of Christ, who will ultimately judge all (<a href="/2_timothy/4.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with authority and pastoral concern.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community struggling with issues of sin and division.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul's_second_visit.htm">Paul's Second Visit</a></b><br>A previous visit by Paul to Corinth, during which he addressed issues within the church.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sinners_in_the_church.htm">Sinners in the Church</a></b><br>Individuals within the Corinthian church who were engaging in sinful behavior.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul's_warning.htm">Paul's Warning</a></b><br>A stern admonition from Paul, indicating his readiness to take disciplinary action if necessary.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_church_discipline.htm">The Role of Church Discipline</a></b><br>Church discipline is a necessary and biblical practice to maintain the purity and integrity of the Christian community.

During that second stay:<p>&#8226; Sin was confronted face-to-face, but many still resisted change (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s apostolic authority was evident (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-8.htm">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>), yet he chose patience, hoping godly sorrow (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-9.htm">2 Corinthians 7:9-10</a>) would lead to repentance.<p>&#8226; The mention of that visit now underscores: God&#8217;s leaders are not fickle; they follow through (<a href="/james/5-12.htm">James 5:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So now in my absence I warn those who sinned earlier</b><p>Paul writes from a distance, but his concern is present and urgent. &#8220;Those who sinned earlier&#8221; likely include:<p>&#8226; The sexually immoral rebuked in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-5</a>, still needing full repentance.<p>&#8226; The divisive, gossiping, and disorderly named in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>.<p>&#8226; Any who question Paul&#8217;s authority and so undermine Scripture&#8217;s standards (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-3.htm">2 Corinthians 13:3</a>).<p>His written warning echoes Christ&#8217;s pattern in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>: private rebuke, then broader confrontation, before public discipline&#8212;always aiming to win the brother.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and everyone else: If I return, I will not spare anyone</b><p>Paul widens the circle: even bystanders must examine themselves (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>).

What he has in view is obviously passing a sentence of the nature of an excommunication on the offenders, "delivering them to Satan" (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-20.htm" title="Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.">1Timothy 1:20</a>), with the assured confidence that that sentence would be followed by some sharp bodily suffering. In that case men would have, as he says in the next verse, a crucial <span class= "ital">test</span> whether Christ was speaking in him, and learn that he whom they despised as <span class= "ital">infirm</span> had a reserve-force of spiritual power, showing itself in supernatural effects even in the regions of man's natural life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I told you before;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">have told you before. <span class="cmt_word"></span>As if I were present, the second time.</span> The meaning seems to be, "You must understand this announcement as distinctly as if I were with you, and uttered it by word of mouth." <span class="cmt_word">And being absent now I write;</span> rather, <span class="accented">so now being absent.</span> The verb "I write" is almost certainly an explanatory gloss. <span class="cmt_word">And to all other;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and to the rest, all of them.</span> Namely, to those who, though they may not have fallen into gross sin, still rejected St. Paul's authority, and said that he was afraid to come in person. <span class="cmt_word">I will not spare</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; 2 Corinthians 4:19, 21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/13-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I already warned [you]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#961;&#959;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Proeir&#275;ka)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4302.htm">Strong's 4302: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tell (say) beforehand, forewarn, declare, tell plainly.
