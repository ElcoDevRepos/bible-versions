He refrains from taking credit for the work done by others, a principle rooted in the biblical value of honesty and respect for others' contributions. This reflects the broader biblical teaching against pride and self-exaltation, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a>, which advises letting others praise you rather than boasting yourself. In the context of Corinth, a city known for its diverse and competitive culture, Paul's approach contrasts with the behavior of false apostles who sought to elevate themselves by claiming others' achievements.<p><b>But we hope that as your faith increases,</b><br>Paul expresses a desire for the spiritual growth of the Corinthian believers. This aligns with the biblical theme of growth in faith, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a>, which encourages believers to grow in grace and knowledge. The increase in faith is not just personal but communal, impacting the entire body of Christ. Historically, Corinth was a major trade city, and the growth of the church there would have significant implications for spreading the gospel throughout the region.<p><b>our area of influence among you will greatly increase as well,</b><br>Paul anticipates that as the Corinthians' faith matures, his ministry's impact will expand. This reflects the principle of stewardship, where increased faith leads to greater responsibility and opportunity for ministry, as seen in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>). The phrase also suggests a strategic vision for mission work, where the strengthening of one community can lead to broader evangelistic efforts. This expansion is not for personal gain but for the advancement of the gospel, aligning with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians, addressing issues within the church and defending his apostolic authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthians.htm">Corinthians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, members of the church in Corinth, a city known for its diversity and moral challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostolic_ministry.htm">Apostolic Ministry</a></b><br>The broader context of Paul's ministry, which involved spreading the Gospel and establishing churches across the Roman Empire.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_ministry.htm">Humility in Ministry</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes not boasting beyond limits, teaching us to recognize and respect the contributions of others in ministry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_influence.htm">Faith and Influence</a></b><br>As faith grows, so does the potential for influence.

The context leads, however, to the conclusion that it was a charge that had been brought against him. They had spoken of him as pushing on from point to point, as with a measureless ambition. Perhaps the fact that he had worked at Antioch, where the gospel had been preached by men of Cyprus and Cyrene (<a href="/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>), at Troas, where it had been preached by St. Luke (see Notes on <a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,">2Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="/acts/16-8.htm" title="And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.">Acts 16:8</a>), to the Romans whom he found at Corinth, and who, like Aquila and Priscilla, had been already converted (see Notes on <a href="/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>), were thought to give a colour to the charge that he was boasting in other men's labours.<p><span class= "bld">Having hope, when your faith is increased.</span>--The verb is in the present tense, and should be translated, <span class= "ital">as your faith grows.</span> The words are spoken in the spirit of one--<p>"Nil actum reputans si quid superesset agendum"<p>["Who thinks nought done while aught remains to do"]-- . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That is, of other men's labours.</span> Not to thrust himself obtrusively into spheres of labour which legitimately belonged to others was a part of St. Paul's scrupulously chivalrous rule (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-10.htm">2 Corinthians 3:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>; <a href="/romans/15-20.htm">Romans 15:20</a>).
