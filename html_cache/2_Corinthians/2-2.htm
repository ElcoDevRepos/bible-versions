This reflects his pastoral heart and the delicate balance he seeks between correction and encouragement. The context is his previous letter, which was stern and corrective (1 Corinthians). Paul&#8217;s intention was not to cause unnecessary pain but to lead them to repentance and spiritual growth. This phrase highlights the relational dynamics between a spiritual leader and their congregation, emphasizing the importance of love and sensitivity in leadership.<p><b>who is left to cheer me</b><br>Paul acknowledges his emotional connection to the Corinthian believers. His joy is intertwined with their spiritual well-being. This reflects the mutual dependency within the body of Christ, where leaders and followers support and uplift each other. The phrase underscores the principle found in <a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>, "Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn," illustrating the interconnectedness of believers.<p><b>but those whom I have grieved?</b><br>Paul points out the irony that those he has caused sorrow are also his source of comfort. This highlights the transformative power of Christian relationships, where even difficult interactions can lead to deeper bonds and mutual encouragement. It also reflects the redemptive nature of God&#8217;s work in the church, where conflict and correction can lead to growth and unity. This is reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>, "Wounds from a friend can be trusted," emphasizing the value of honest and loving correction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians.

He had wished to avoid a visit that would cause sorrow to himself and others, and events had shown that he was right. But it might be said, perhaps had been said, that he didn't seem to care about giving pain when he wrote, as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-18.htm" title="Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.">1Corinthians 4:18</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.">1Corinthians 5:2-7</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-5.htm" title="I speak to your shame.

"Yes," is his answer; "but then the pain which <span class= "ital">I</span> inflict" (the pronoun is emphatic) "gives to him who suffers it the power of giving me joy, and so works out an ample compensation;" a thought to which he returns in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-8.htm" title="For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same letter has made you sorry, though it were but for a season.">2Corinthians 7:8</a>.
