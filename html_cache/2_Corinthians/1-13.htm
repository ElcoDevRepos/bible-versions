This reflects his pastoral concern and desire for the believers to grasp the teachings fully. In the Greco-Roman world, letters were a primary means of communication, and Paul often used this medium to address issues and provide guidance. The phrase suggests that the message of the Gospel is accessible and not reserved for an elite group with special knowledge, countering the Gnostic tendencies of the time that promoted secret wisdom. This aligns with the biblical principle that God's Word is meant to be understood by all believers, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/30-11.htm">Deuteronomy 30:11-14</a>, which emphasizes the accessibility of God's commandments.<p><b>And I hope that you will understand us completely,</b><br>Paul expresses his desire for the Corinthians to fully comprehend his intentions and teachings. This hope for complete understanding underscores the relational aspect of Paul's ministry, where mutual understanding and trust are vital. The historical context reveals that Paul faced misunderstandings and opposition in Corinth, partly due to false apostles who questioned his authority and motives (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13-15</a>). By expressing this hope, Paul seeks to strengthen the bond between himself and the Corinthian believers, fostering unity and dispelling doubts. This reflects the broader biblical theme of unity in the body of Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>, which calls for maintaining the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians, addressing issues within the church and providing guidance and encouragement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality, where Paul established a church during his missionary journeys.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a diverse group of believers facing internal conflicts and misunderstandings about Paul's teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/clarity_in_communication.htm">Clarity in Communication</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes the importance of clear and understandable communication in teaching and sharing the Gospel.

It is as though he said: "I have no hidden meaning in what I write and you read. What you read you read aright in its plain and simple sense. I hope" (the very hope implies that it had been otherwise) "that the more you know me the more will you so read me and judge me even to the end, the great day when the Lord shall come and all things shall be made plain." (Comp. <a href="/context/1_corinthians/4-3.htm" title="But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yes, I judge not my own self.">1Corinthians 4:3-5</a>.) Possibly, however, the words "even to the end" may be merely equivalent to "completely." (See Note on <a href="/john/13-1.htm" title="Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.">John 13:1</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we write none other things unto you,</span> etc. Remarks like these obviously presuppose that the conduct and character of St. Paul had been misrepresented and calumniated. The perpetual recurrence to a strain of self-defence would have been needless if some one - probably Titus - had not told St. Paul that his opponents accused him of <span class="accented">insincerity</span>. Here, therefore, he tells them that he is opening out his very heart towards them. What he had to say to them and of them was here set forth without any subterfuges or <span class="accented">arrieres pensees</span>. He had nothing <span class="accented">esoteric</span> which differed from <span class="accented">exoteric</span> teaching. It is a melancholy thought that even such a one as Paul was reduced to the sad necessity of defending himself against such charges as that he intrigued with individual members of his Churches, wrote private letters or sent secret messages which differed in tone from those which were read in the public assembly<span class="cmt_word">. Or acknowledge;</span> rather, <span class="accented">or even fully know</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from other sources. The paronomasia of the original cannot be preserved in English, but in Latin would be "Quae legitis aut etiam inteltigitis." <span class="cmt_word">And I trust... even to the end</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but I hope that, even unto the end, ye will fully know - even as ye fully knew us in part - that we are your subject of boast</span>. After telling them that they have in this letter his genuine and inmost thoughts, he adds that "even as <span class="accented">some of them</span> (for this seem to be implied by the 'in part') already knew well that the mutual relations between him and them were something wherein to glory, he hopes that they will appreciate this fact, even to the end." He <span class="accented">knows</span> that <span class="accented">some</span> honour him; he hopes that all will do so; but he can only express this as a hope, for he is aware that there are calumnies abroad respecting him, so that he cannot feel sure of their unbroken allegiance. Such seems to be the meaning; but the state of mind in which St. Paul wrote has evidently troubled his style, and his expressions are less lucid and more difficult to unravel in this Epistle than in any other. <span class="accented">To</span> <span class="accented">the end</span>. The expression is quite general, like our "to the last." He does not seem <span class="accented">definitely</span> to imply either to the end of his life or to the coming of Christ, which they regarded as the end of all things, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-8.htm">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/1-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
