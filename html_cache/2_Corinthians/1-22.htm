It was used to signify authority and protection. In the context of <a href="/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>, the seal represents God's ownership and the believer's security in Christ. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>, where believers are sealed with the Holy Spirit. The seal signifies that believers are set apart for God, much like a king's seal would mark a document as official and protected by the king's authority. This sealing is a divine act, indicating that believers are under God's protection and are His possession.<p><b>and put His Spirit in our hearts</b><br>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is a central theme in the New Testament, signifying the new covenant relationship between God and His people. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including mind, will, and emotions. The Holy Spirit residing in believers' hearts indicates a profound transformation and ongoing relationship with God. This indwelling is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give a new heart and spirit to His people. The presence of the Holy Spirit empowers believers to live according to God's will and to bear spiritual fruit.<p><b>as a pledge of what is to come</b><br>The term "pledge" in this context is akin to a down payment or earnest money, guaranteeing the full inheritance to come. This concept is also found in <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>, where the Holy Spirit is described as a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance. The pledge signifies the certainty of God's promises, including eternal life and the future resurrection. It assures believers of their future glorification and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan. This assurance is rooted in the faithfulness of God, who has begun a good work in believers and will carry it on to completion (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).

Originally a Hebrew word, from a verb meaning "to mix," "to change," "to pledge," and so used, as a cognate noun, with the last of the three senses, it appears simply transliterated in the LXX. of <a href="/context/genesis/38-17.htm" title="And he said, I will send you a kid from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a pledge, till you send it?">Genesis 38:17-18</a>. It would seem to have been in common use among the Canaanite or Phoenician traders, and was carried by them to Greece, to Carthage, to Alexandria, and to Rome. It was used by the Greek orator Isaeus, and by Plautus and Terence among the earlier Latin writers. The full form came to be considered somehow as pedantic or vulgar, and was superseded in Roman law by the shortened "arrha," the payment of a small sum given on the completion of a bargain as a pledge that the payer would fulfil the contract; and it has passed into Italian as "arra;" into modern French, as "les arrhes;" into popular Scotch even, as "arles." As applied by St. Paul, it had the force of a condensed parable, such as the people of commercial cities like Corinth and Ephesus would readily understand. They were not to think that their past spiritual experience had any character of finality. It was rather but the pledge of yet greater gifts to come: even of that knowledge of God which is eternal life (<a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>). The same thought is expressed, under a more Hebrew image, in the "<span class= "ital">firstfruits</span> of the Spirit" in <a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>. Grammatically, the "earnest of the Spirit" may be taken as an example of the genitive of apposition, "the earnest which <span class= "ital">is</span> the Spirit." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who hath also sealed us</span>. We cannot be deconsecrated, disanointed. Still less can the confirming seal be broken. He continues to dwell on the conception of the unchangeableness of God and of the gospel into which he had been incidentally led by the charge of "lightness." <span class="cmt_word">The earnest of the Spirit.</span> The promises which we have received are not mere promises, they are already so far fulfilled to us and in us as to guarantee hereafter their plenary fruition. Just as in money bargains "earnest money," "money on account," is given, in pledge that the whole will be ultimately discharged, so we have "the earnest of the Spirit" (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-5.htm">2 Corinthians 5:5</a>), "the firstfruits of the Spirit" (<a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>), which are to us "the earnest" or pledge money that we shall hereafter enter upon the purchased possession (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>). We now see the meaning of the "and." It involves a climax - the promise is much; the unction more; the seal a still further security (<a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>); but beyond all this we have already a part payment in the indwelling of the Present of God (<a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>; <a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>). The word <span class="accented">arrabon</span>, rendered "earnest," has an interesting history. It is very ancient, for it is found (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) in <a href="/genesis/38-17.htm">Genesis 38:17, 18</a>, and comes from a root meaning "to pledge." It seems to be a Phoenician word, which had been introduced into various languages by the universality of Phoenician commerce. In classical Latin it is shortened into <span class="accented">arrha</span>, and it still exists in Italian as <span class="accented">aura</span>, in French as <span class="accented">arrhes</span>. The equivalent Hebrew figure is "firstfruits" (<a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">placed His seal</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#966;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(sphragisamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4972.htm">Strong's 4972: </a> </span><span class="str2">To seal, set a seal upon.
