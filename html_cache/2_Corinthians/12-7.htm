These revelations include being caught up to the third heaven and hearing inexpressible things. Such experiences could lead to pride, which is why Paul emphasizes the need for humility. The Bible often warns against pride (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>), and Paul's experience serves as a reminder of the importance of humility in the face of divine favor.<p><b>So to keep me from becoming conceited,</b><br>Paul acknowledges the human tendency towards pride, especially when one is given special insights or experiences. This phrase highlights the preventative measure God took to maintain Paul's humility. The concept of God allowing challenges to foster spiritual growth is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, where trials are said to produce perseverance and maturity.<p><b>I was given a thorn in my flesh,</b><br>The "thorn" is a metaphor for a persistent problem or affliction.

This concept is echoed in the struggles of other biblical figures, such as Job, who faced severe trials yet remained faithful.<p><b>a messenger of Satan,</b><br>This phrase suggests that the thorn was a form of spiritual warfare, permitted by God but originating from Satan.

This aligns with the biblical principle that God's strength is made perfect in weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).

It will be well to begin with getting as closely as we can at the idea of the central word. The Greek word for "thorn," then, might better be translated <span class= "ital">stake.</span> It is used, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> of stakes thrust into the ground to form a palisade round a grave--<p>"And round about they dug a trench full deep,<p>And wide and large, and round it fixed their <span class= "ital">stakes.</span>"<p>--Homer, <span class= "ital">Iliad,</span> vii. 441.<p>A sharp-pointed stake of this kind was often used as a means of torture in the punishment known as impaling, and the two Greek words for "impaling" and "crucifying" were indeed almost interchangeable (Herod. i. 128; ix. 18). So in Euripides (<span class= "ital">Iphig. in</span> <span class= "ital">Tauris.</span> 1430)--<p>"Say, shall we hurl them down from lofty rock,<p>Or fix their bodies on the <span class= "ital">stake?"</span><p>It is significant that men like Celsus and Lucian, writing against the faith of Christians, used the term "stake" instead of "cross," as more ignominious, and spoke of Jesus as having been "impaled" instead of "crucified" (Origen, c. Cels. ii.; Lucian, D<span class= "ital">e morte Peregr.,</span> p. 762). So Chrysostom used the word "impaled" of St. Peter's crucifixion. On the other hand, medical writers, such as Dioscorides and Artemidorus, by whose use of the word, as possibly coming to him through St. Luke, St. Paul was likely to be influenced, apply the term to what we call a "splinter" getting into the flesh and causing acute inflammation (<span class= "ital">Diosc.</span> ii. 29; iv. 176). Dioscorides, it may be noted, was a native of Anazarba in Cilicia, and probably a contemporary of St. Paul's. The word used figuratively, therefore, comes to bring with it the sense of some acute form of suffering, something, to use a word of like history and significance, <span class= "ital">excruciating</span> in its character. So used, it might, as far as the word itself is concerned, be applied to any sharp agony, either of mind or body.<p>The history of the interpretations which have been given to this mysterious term is not without interest as a psychological study. Men have clearly been influenced, to a large extent, by their subjective tendencies. They have measured the sufferings of St. Paul by their own experience, and thinking that he must have felt as they felt, have seen in his "thorn in the flesh" that which they felt to be their own sharpest trial. Some of these conjectures may be dismissed very briefly. It cannot be, as some have thought, the remembrance of his own guilt in persecuting the disciples of Christ, for that would not have been described as a "thorn <span class= "ital">in the flesh"</span> nor could he well have prayed that it should depart from him. For a like reason, it could not have been, as some Protestant commentators have imagined, any doubt as to the certainty of his own salvation, or of his being included in God's pardoning love. We may safely set aside, again, the view that he refers to his struggle with heathen enemies, like Demetrius, or Judaising rivals, for these had been included in his list of sufferings in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-22.htm" title="Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.">2Corinthians 11:22-23</a>, and here he is clearly speaking of something generically new. There remain two hypotheses. (1) That he speaks of the conflict with sensual passion; and (2), that he refers to some chronic infirmity of body that brought with it constantly recurring attacks of acute pain. For each of these a strong case may be made out. In favour of (1) it may be urged that the language of St. Paul in not a few places implies the existence of such a struggle with temptation. He sees a law in his members warring against the law of his mind (<a href="/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>). Sin wrought in him all manner of concupiscence (<a href="/romans/7-8.htm" title="But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, worked in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.">Romans 7:8</a>). He found it necessary to keep under his body, and bring it into subjection (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-27.htm" title="But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.">1Corinthians 9:27</a>). What has been said as to the question, "Who is offended, and I burn not?" suggests a special sympathy with that form of struggle against evil; and in the "fire-tipt darts of the wicked one" of <a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm" title="Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.">Ephesians 6:16</a> (where we have the participle of the same verb), we may, perhaps, trace an allusive reference to impulses of this nature. It is clear that with some temperaments temptations such as this, besides the moral pain which they bring with them, may inflict a bodily suffering little less than excruciating, and the words that speak of the "flesh" as the seat of suffering, and of its being a "messenger of Satan," at least fall in with the view thus presented. Nor is it enough to say, on the other hand, that St. Paul's character made such temptations impossible. The long line of patristic, and mediaeval, and modern Romish interpreters who have taken this view, though of little weight as an authority, is, at least, evidence that they knew the bitterness of such temptations, and though their thoughts may have been coloured by the experiences of the monastic life and enforced celibacy, as in the story of the temptations of St. Antony, we may fairly read in their testimony the fact that sensual temptation may assail men who are aiming at a high ascetic standard of holiness. Experience seems, indeed, to show that the ecstatic temperament, with its high-wrought emotional excitement, is more than most others liable to the attacks of this form of evil. So the daily evening hymn of St. Ambrose includes the prayer, "<span class= "ital">ne polluantur corpora."</span> So Augustine bewails the recurrence in dreams of the old sensuous temptations to which he had yielded in his youth (<span class= "ital">Confess.</span> x. 30); and Jerome is not ashamed to tell the history of such temptations, alternating here also with ecstatic visions of divine glories, to the female friend whom he exhorts to persevere in her vow of chastity (<span class= "ital">Epist. ad Eustochium,</span> c. 7). It may be added that this view falls in with the tone in which St. Paul approaches "the thorn in the flesh" as the crown of all his infirmities. No self-humiliation could go beyond this disclosure of what most men hide. As in the confessions of Augustine and Jerome, just referred to, the last veil is withdrawn, and men are told that the man who has had visions of God is one of like passions with themselves, subject, as they are, to the strongest temptations of his sensuous nature. As in the triumphs of the Emperors of Rome, a slave rode in the same chariot with the conqueror, and bade him ever and anon remember that he also was a man, so here there was a continual reminder that he too might become as others were. If there was any danger of being exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, nothing could more easily bring a man down from that ideal height than the consciousness that this was his besetting temptation. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-10.</span> <span class="accented">- The thorn in the flesh</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest I should be exalted above measure;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that I may not be over exalted</span>.

It is only by placing side by side a great many separate passages that we are almost irresistibly led to the conclusion which is now most generally adopted, namely, that it was acute and disfiguring ophthalmia, originating in the blinding glare of the light which flashed round him at Damascus, and accompanied, as that most humiliating disease usually is, by occasional cerebral excitement.
