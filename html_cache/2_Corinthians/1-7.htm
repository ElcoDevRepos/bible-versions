This hope is not wishful thinking but a firm assurance rooted in faith. In the biblical context, hope is often linked with trust in God's promises (<a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>). Paul's confidence is based on the faithfulness of God, who has delivered and will continue to deliver His people (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-10.htm">2 Corinthians 1:10</a>). This assurance is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, emphasizing the certainty of God's plans (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><b>because we know that just as you share in our sufferings</b><br>Paul acknowledges the shared experience of suffering among believers. This reflects the early Christian understanding that following Christ often involves trials and persecution (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>). The sufferings Paul refers to could include physical persecution, emotional distress, or spiritual struggles. The communal aspect of suffering is significant, as it fosters unity and empathy within the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>). This sharing in sufferings is also seen as a participation in the sufferings of Christ (<a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>).<p><b>so also you will share in our comfort</b><br>Paul assures the Corinthians that just as they share in sufferings, they will also partake in the comfort that comes from God. This comfort is not merely relief from distress but a deep, abiding peace and encouragement from the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>). The Greek word for comfort, "paraklesis," implies a coming alongside to help or encourage. This reflects the role of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>). The promise of comfort is a reminder of God's faithfulness to provide for His people in times of trouble (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a>). This dual experience of suffering and comfort is a pattern seen throughout Scripture, illustrating the redemptive work of God in the lives of believers (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with encouragement and teaching.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthians.htm">Corinthians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Corinth facing various challenges and persecutions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sufferings.htm">Sufferings</a></b><br>Refers to the trials and tribulations faced by Paul and the Corinthians, which are part of the Christian experience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/comfort.htm">Comfort</a></b><br>The consolation and encouragement provided by God, which Paul assures the Corinthians they will share in.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The source of all comfort, who provides strength and hope to believers in times of suffering.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_hope.htm">The Certainty of Hope</a></b><br>Our hope in Christ is steadfast and sure, rooted in the promises of God.

His unwavering hope rests on proven knowledge of God&#8217;s faithfulness. Because they participate in the same hardships he endures for Christ, they will unquestionably partake in the same abundant comfort God pours out. Suffering and consolation travel together in the believer&#8217;s life, and both serve to deepen fellowship with Christ and with one another.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And our hope of you is stedfast.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">our hope on behalf of you.</span> The sentence is brought in as a kind of parenthesis connected with the word "enduring." He had not used that word lightly, still less as a tacit reproach, as though they were wanting in endurance. His hope for them, for their salvation in the fullest sense of the word, had never been stronger than it was at that moment.<p><span class= "bld">So shall ye be also of the consolation.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">so are ye also.</span> The verb is not expressed in the Greek, but it is more natural to supply it in the tense which had been used before. The English version practically dilutes the hope by throwing it into a future, which may be near or distant, instead of connecting it with the actual present. The Apostle could not doubt for a moment that they were at that very time sharers in the comfort as well as in the sufferings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And our hope of you is steadfast;</span> literally, <span class="accented">And our hope is steadfast on your behalf</span>. The variations of text and punctuation in the verse do not materially affect the sense. The meaning is "And I have a sure hope that you will reap the benefits of our common fellowship with Christ in his affliction, and of the comfort which he sends, because I know that you have experienced the sufferings, and am therefore sure that he will send you the strength and the endurance.
