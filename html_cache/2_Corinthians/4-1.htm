It indicates a conclusion or result based on what has been previously stated, emphasizing the continuity of thought.<p><b>since God in His mercy has given us this ministry,</b><br>Paul acknowledges that the ministry he and his companions have received is a result of God's mercy. This reflects the biblical theme of grace, where God bestows gifts and responsibilities not based on human merit but out of His compassion and kindness. The ministry refers to the apostolic mission of spreading the gospel, which Paul sees as a divine calling. This aligns with passages like <a href="/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7</a>, where Paul speaks of becoming a servant of the gospel by the gift of God's grace.<p><b>we do not lose heart.</b><br>Despite the challenges and opposition faced in ministry, Paul and his companions remain steadfast and encouraged. The phrase "do not lose heart" suggests perseverance and resilience, which are central themes in Paul's letters. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of enduring faith, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1-3</a>, where believers are encouraged to run with perseverance the race marked out for them, fixing their eyes on Jesus.

Because the Spirit gives life and freedom (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>), Paul moves forward with confidence.<p>- This bridge word reminds us that ministry is never done in a vacuum; it rests on everything God has already revealed and accomplished. As <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> shows, doctrine drives duty: &#8220;Therefore, I urge you, brothers, on account of God&#8217;s mercy&#8230;&#8221;.<p>- We stand on a settled foundation. Since the gospel is true, we have every reason to act upon it and no reason to retreat (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24&#8211;25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since God in His mercy has given us this ministry</b><p>- Ministry is a gift, not a personal achievement. Paul echoes his own testimony in <a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12&#8211;14</a>, where he recalls how Christ &#8220;considered me faithful, appointing me to service&#8230; and the grace of our Lord overflowed to me&#8221;.<p>- Mercy frames everything:<p>&#8226; God withholds the judgment we deserve and instead places us in service (<a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; We become &#8220;stewards of the mysteries of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>), entrusted to share the gospel that saves.<p>- The phrase also highlights corporate calling&#8212;&#8220;us,&#8221; not merely Paul. Every believer has a role in God&#8217;s redemptive plan (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>- Recognizing mercy guards against pride and fuels gratitude. Like Paul, we remember we were once &#8220;objects of wrath&#8221; but are now vessels of mercy (<a href="/romans/9-23.htm">Romans 9:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we do not lose heart</b><p>- The natural temptation, especially in hardship, is discouragement. Paul faced relentless opposition (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23&#8211;28</a>), yet he refuses to quit.<p>- Courage flows from three gospel realities:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness&#8212;&#8220;He who calls you is faithful, and He will do it&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Eternal perspective&#8212;&#8220;For our light and momentary affliction is producing for us an eternal glory&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Inner renewal&#8212;&#8220;Though our outer self is wasting away, yet our inner self is being renewed day by day&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>).<p>- Similar encouragement appears in <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>: &#8220;Let us not grow weary in doing good,&#8221; and in <a href="/hebrews/12-3.htm">Hebrews 12:3</a>: &#8220;Consider Him who endured such hostility&#8230; so that you will not grow weary and lose heart&#8221;.<p>- Because the ministry is God-given and mercy-rooted, perseverance becomes the logical, Spirit-empowered response (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul looks back (&#8220;Therefore&#8221;) to the unveiled glory of the new covenant, looks up to God&#8217;s mercy (&#8220;has given us this ministry&#8221;), and then looks forward with resilient hope (&#8220;we do not lose heart&#8221;). The verse teaches that every act of Christian service rests on God&#8217;s gracious initiative, is sustained by His ongoing compassion, and produces steadfastness even in adversity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>IV.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Therefore seeing we have this ministry.</span>--The ministry referred to is that of which such great things have just been said: the ministry of the new covenant, of the Spirit, of righteousness, of glory (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2Corinthians 3:6</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/3-8.htm" title="How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?">2Corinthians 3:8-9</a>). Two thoughts rise up in the Apostle's mind in immediate association with this: (1) His own utter unworthiness of it, which finds expression in "as we have received mercy" (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1Timothy 1:12</a>); and (2) the manifold trials and difficulties in the midst of which it had to be accomplished.
