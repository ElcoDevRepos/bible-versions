The Law was considered glorious because it was divinely instituted and revealed God's standards for holiness and righteousness. The glory of the Old Covenant is often associated with the physical manifestation of God's presence, such as the shining face of Moses after receiving the tablets (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>). The Law served as a tutor to lead people to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>), highlighting the need for a savior due to humanity's inability to fully adhere to it.<p><b>has no glory now</b><br>The phrase indicates a shift from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant, established through Jesus Christ. The Old Covenant's glory is now seen as diminished or obsolete in light of the New Covenant. <a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a> speaks of the Old Covenant as becoming obsolete and aging, ready to vanish away.

This New Covenant is marked by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, offering believers a direct and personal relationship with God (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6-8</a>). The glory of the New Covenant is eternal and transformative, unlike the temporary and external nature of the Old Covenant's glory. This surpassing glory is also seen in the promise of eternal life and the hope of resurrection, as well as the fulfillment of prophecies concerning the Messiah (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>). The New Covenant's glory is ultimately rooted in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God's glory (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

The English expresses it very fairly. "In this point," as compared with the gospel, the Law has lost its glory; it is thrown into the shade by "the glory that excelleth." The imagery seems to bring before us the symbolic meaning of the Transfiguration. Moses and Elijah appear in glory, but the glory of the Son of Man surpasses that of either. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/16-1.htm" title="The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven.">Matthew 16:1-4</a>.)

In other words, the glory of Mosaism is so completely outdazzled by the splendour of the gospel, that, relatively speaking, it has no glory left; the moon and the stars cease to shine, they "pale their ineffectual fires" when the sun is in the zenith.
