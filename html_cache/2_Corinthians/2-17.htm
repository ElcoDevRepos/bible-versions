In the first-century Greco-Roman world, itinerant teachers and philosophers often charged fees for their teachings. Paul, however, emphasizes his integrity and the purity of his motives. This echoes his earlier statements in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-18.htm">1 Corinthians 9:18</a>, where he insists on preaching the gospel free of charge. The term "peddle" suggests a corrupting influence, akin to a merchant diluting wine to increase profit. This warning against false teachers is consistent with other New Testament passages, such as <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1-3</a>, which caution against those who exploit believers with deceptive words.<p><b>On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity,</b><br>Paul asserts that his message is delivered with genuine intent, rooted in his relationship with Christ. The phrase "in Christ" signifies the source of his authority and the transformative power of his message. Speaking "before God" implies accountability and transparency, as God is the ultimate judge of motives and actions. This sincerity is a hallmark of true apostleship, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>, where Paul states that he speaks not to please man, but God. The emphasis on sincerity aligns with Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6:1-4</a>, where He warns against performing religious acts for human approval.<p><b>as men sent from God.</b><br>Paul identifies himself and his companions as divinely commissioned messengers. This apostolic authority is rooted in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>) and the specific calling Paul received on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15-16</a>). The concept of being "sent" echoes the Old Testament prophets, who were chosen by God to deliver His message, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>. This divine sending underscores the legitimacy and urgency of their mission, distinguishing them from false teachers who lack such a mandate. The phrase also reflects the broader biblical theme of God using chosen individuals to accomplish His purposes, as seen in the lives of Moses, Jeremiah, and ultimately, Jesus Christ, the ultimate "sent one" (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

Even then the ways of error were manifold, and the way of truth was one. Among Judaisers, and the seekers after Greek wisdom, asserters of license for liberty, questioners of the resurrection: how few were those who preached the true word of God in its purity! The word for "corrupt," formed from a word which signifies "huckster" or "tavern-keeper," implies an adulteration like that which such people commonly practised. We, says St. Paul, play no such tricks of trade with what we preach; we do not meet the tastes of our hearers by prophesying deceits. The very fact that we know the tremendous issues of our work would hinder that. Comp. St. Peter's use of the same figure in "the sincere (the <span class= "ital">unadulterated</span>) milk of the <span class= "ital">reason"</span> (<a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm" title="As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:">1Peter 2:2</a>). It is doubtful whether the imagery of the triumph is still present to his thoughts. If it were, we may think of the word "corrupt" as connected with the thought of the sweet savour: "Our incense, at any rate, is pure. If it brings death it is through no fault of ours. It is not a poisoned perfume."<p><span class= "bld">As of sincerity, but as of God.</span>--The two clauses are half connected, half contrasted. To have said "of sincerity" alone would have been giving too much prominence to what was purely subjective. He could not feel sure that he was sincere unless he knew that his sincerity was given to him by God. (For the word "sincerity," see Note on <a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2Corinthians 1:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we are not as many;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as the many</span>. This clause is introduced to show how much courage and effort the work requires. "The many" might, by Greek idiom, mean "the majority." The apparent harshness of the assertion that the majority of teachers in the apostolic age dealt untruly with the Word of God, led to the substitution of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, the rest, in some manuscripts (D, E, F, G, L). But "the many" here means "the many antagonists of mine," who preach a different gospel (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>). It must be remembered that conceit, Pharisaism, moral laxity, and factions were all at work in the Corinthian Church. <span class="cmt_word">Which corrupt.</span> The Word means who are merely" trafficking with," "adulterating<span class="accented"></span>," "huckstering<span class="accented"></span>," the Word of life. The word occurs in the LXX. of <a href="/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>; Ecclus. 26:29; and Plato applies the same metaphor to the sophists, who peddle their wisdom about ('Protag.,' p. 313 d). The substantive <span class="accented">kapelos</span> means "a retail dealer," and especially a vintner, and the verb <span class="accented">kapeleuo is</span> always used in a bad sense, like the English "to huckster." Such deceitful dealers with the gospel are described in <a href="/2_peter/2-3.htm">2 Peter 2:3</a>, and in one of the Ignatian letters they are called <span class="accented">Christemporoi</span>, Christ-traffickers. Such were those who altered the perspective of the gospel, lowered its standard, and adulterated it with strange admixtures.
