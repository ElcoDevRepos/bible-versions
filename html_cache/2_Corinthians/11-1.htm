This reflects the rhetorical style of the time, where speakers often used self-deprecating language to engage their audience. In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is defending his apostleship against false apostles who were leading the Corinthians astray. His "foolishness" refers to boasting about his credentials and experiences, which he feels compelled to do to protect the church. This approach is similar to the Old Testament prophets who sometimes used irony to convey God's message (e.g., Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>).<p><b>but you are already doing that</b><br>Paul acknowledges that the Corinthians have already been enduring his previous letters and teachings, which some might have considered foolish or hard to accept. This phrase indicates a relationship where Paul feels confident in their patience and willingness to listen, despite the challenges. Historically, Corinth was a major city in Greece, known for its wealth and moral challenges, which made the church there susceptible to false teachings. Paul's relationship with the Corinthians was complex, marked by both affection and frustration, as seen in his earlier letters (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10-13</a>). This ongoing dialogue shows the pastoral care Paul had for the church, akin to a shepherd guiding his flock, a type of Christ's relationship with the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the letter, addressing the Corinthian church.

Paul begins this section with a warm, almost playful appeal: &#8220;I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-1.htm">2 Corinthians 11:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;foolishness&#8221; he speaks of is his upcoming &#8220;boasting&#8221; about his ministry, something he normally considers unwise (compare <a href="/2_corinthians/10-17.htm">2 Corinthians 10:17&#8211;18</a>; 11:16&#8211;18).<p>&#8226; By labeling it &#8220;foolish,&#8221; Paul reinforces his humility:<p>&#8211; He knows that true commendation comes from the Lord, not self-promotion (<a href="/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-7.htm">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>).<p>&#8211; Yet, for the Corinthians&#8217; protection, he must refute false apostles; so he reluctantly engages in what sounds like personal boasting (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-12.htm">2 Corinthians 11:12&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; This gentle request also shows pastoral tenderness&#8212;he never bulldozes the church but invites their patience as he defends the gospel entrusted to him (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Indeed you are bearing with me</b><p>&#8226; Paul quickly adds, &#8220;but indeed you are bearing with me,&#8221; affirming their present willingness to hear him out.<p>&#8226; He appeals to the affection already established:<p>&#8211; Earlier they &#8220;opened wide&#8221; their hearts to him (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-11.htm">2 Corinthians 6:11-13</a>).<p>&#8211; They had responded well to his earlier letter of correction and expressed renewed zeal (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8-11, 15</a>-16).<p>&#8226; By recognizing their ongoing patience, Paul:<p>&#8211; Encourages them to continue discerning truth amid competing voices (<a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29-31</a>).<p>&#8211; Sets a tone of mutual trust, reminding them they have a history of standing with him (<a href="/philippians/4-14.htm">Philippians 4:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; This tenderness guards against defensiveness; instead of scolding, he commends their endurance and invites them to keep partnering for gospel purity (<a href="/galatians/4-12.htm">Galatians 4:12-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_corinthians/11-1.htm">2 Corinthians 11:1</a> captures Paul&#8217;s humble strategy: he must defend his ministry against destructive impostors, yet he dislikes self-boasting and calls it &#8220;foolishness.&#8221; With pastoral warmth he asks the church to tolerate this brief departure from his usual modesty&#8212;something they&#8217;re already inclined to do. The verse sets the stage for the passionate defense that follows, all to safeguard the believers&#8217; simple, pure devotion to Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XI.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Would to God.</span>--As the words "to God" are not in the Greek, it would be better to treat them as the general expression of a wish: <span class= "ital">Would that ye could bear.</span><p><span class= "bld">Ye could bear with me a little in my folly.</span>--There are two catch-words, as it were, which characterise the section of the Epistle on which we are now entering: one is of "bearing with," or "tolerating," which occurs five times (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Would to God you could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.">2Corinthians 11:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-4.htm" title="For if he that comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit, which you have not received, or another gospel, which you have not accepted, you might well bear with him.">2Corinthians 11:4</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-19.htm" title="For you suffer fools gladly, seeing you yourselves are wise.">2Corinthians 11:19-20</a>), and "folly," which, with its kindred "fool," is repeated not less than eight times (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Would to God you could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.">2Corinthians 11:1</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-16.htm" title="I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.">2Corinthians 11:16-17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-19.htm" title="For you suffer fools gladly, seeing you yourselves are wise.">2Corinthians 11:19</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-21.htm" title="I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.

It is impossible to resist the inference that here also we have the echo of something which Titus had reported to him as said by his opponents at Corinth. Their words, we must believe, had taken some such form as this: "We really can bear with him no longer; his folly is becoming altogether intolerable." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Would to God;</span> rather, <span class="accented">would that</span>!
