His travels were not only physically demanding but also spiritually significant, as they were driven by his mission to spread the Gospel. The frequent journeys highlight Paul's commitment and the early church's expansion. <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13-21</a> details many of these journeys, showing the geographical spread of Christianity.<p><b>I have been in danger from rivers</b><br>Traveling in the ancient world often involved crossing rivers, which could be perilous due to flooding or lack of bridges. Rivers like the Jordan and the Tigris were significant in biblical history, symbolizing both physical and spiritual crossings. Paul's mention of rivers underscores the natural hazards he faced, reminiscent of the Israelites crossing the Jordan into the Promised Land (Joshua 3).<p><b>and from bandits</b><br>Banditry was a common threat in the ancient world, especially on less-traveled roads. The parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-30.htm">Luke 10:30-37</a>) illustrates the danger of bandits. Paul's mention of bandits reflects the constant threat of violence and robbery, emphasizing the risks he took for the sake of the Gospel.<p><b>in danger from my countrymen</b><br>Paul, a Jew, faced opposition from his fellow Jews who saw his message as a threat to traditional Jewish beliefs. This danger is evident in <a href="/acts/9-23.htm">Acts 9:23</a>, where Jews plotted to kill him. His transformation from a persecutor of Christians to a proponent of Christ made him a target for those who rejected Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>and from the Gentiles</b><br>Paul also faced hostility from Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23-41</a>, where the silversmiths of Ephesus rioted against him. The Gentile opposition often stemmed from economic or cultural disruptions caused by the spread of Christianity, which challenged pagan practices and beliefs.<p><b>in danger in the city</b><br>Urban centers like Corinth, Ephesus, and Rome were both mission fields and places of danger for Paul. Cities were hubs of cultural and religious diversity, often leading to conflicts. The urban setting provided opportunities for ministry but also increased the risk of persecution, as seen in <a href="/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12-17</a>.<p><b>and in the country</b><br>Rural areas posed their own challenges, including isolation and the potential for hostility from local populations resistant to new teachings. Paul's mention of danger in the country highlights the comprehensive nature of his trials, as he faced threats in both populated and remote areas.<p><b>in danger on the sea</b><br>Paul's sea voyages were fraught with peril, as evidenced by the shipwreck described in <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>. The sea was a symbol of chaos and danger in biblical literature, reflecting the unpredictable nature of maritime travel. Paul's perseverance through these dangers underscores his reliance on God's providence.<p><b>and among false brothers</b><br>Paul frequently warned against false teachers and those who distorted the Gospel (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>). The presence of false brothers within the church posed a significant threat, as they could lead believers astray. This danger highlights the internal challenges the early church faced in maintaining doctrinal purity and unity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is recounting his experiences and the numerous dangers he faced in his ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rivers.htm">Rivers</a></b><br>Symbolic of natural obstacles and perils encountered during Paul's travels.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/robbers.htm">Robbers</a></b><br>Representing the threat of physical harm and theft during his journeys.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_own_people.htm">His own people (Jews)</a></b><br>Referring to the Jewish community, some of whom opposed Paul's message.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who also posed threats to Paul, either through misunderstanding or opposition to his teachings.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_and_countryside.htm">Cities and Countryside</a></b><br>Indicating that Paul faced dangers in both urban and rural settings, showing the widespread nature of his challenges.<br><br>7. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea.htm">Sea</a></b><br>Highlighting the perils of travel by sea, which was common in Paul's missionary journeys.<br><br>8. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_brothers.htm">False Brothers</a></b><br>Individuals within the Christian community who were deceitful or opposed to Paul's teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_ministry.htm">Perseverance in Ministry</a></b><br>Despite numerous dangers, Paul continued his mission.

Some of them may be referred to journeys (as above) before his arrival at Antioch; some, probably, to that from Antioch to Ephesus through the interior of Asia Minor (<a href="/acts/18-23.htm" title="And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.">Acts 18:23</a>; <a href="/acts/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,">Acts 19:1</a>); some to excursions from Ephesus. The "perils of waters" (better, <span class= "ital">rivers</span>) point to the swollen torrents that rush down in spring from the mountain heights of the Taurus and other ranges, and render the streams unfordable. "Robbers" infested, then as now, well-nigh every high-road in Syria and Asia Minor, as in the parable of the Good Samaritan (see Note on <a href="/luke/10-30.htm" title="And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.">Luke 10:30</a>), and the story of St. John and the young robber, as reported from Clement of Alexandria by Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Hist.</span> iii. 23). Of the "perils from his own countrymen," we have instances enough up to this time at Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-23.htm" title="And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:">Acts 9:23</a>), at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/9-29.htm" title="And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.">Acts 9:29</a>), at Antioch in Pisidia, Iconium, and Lystra (<a href="/acts/13-50.htm" title="But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.">Acts 13:50</a>; <a href="/context/acts/14-5.htm" title="And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them spitefully, and to stone them,">Acts 14:5-19</a>), at Thessalonica, and at Corinth (<a href="/context/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5-13</a>; <a href="/acts/18-12.htm" title="And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,">Acts 18:12</a>). Of "perils from the heathen" we find examples at Philippi (<a href="/acts/16-20.htm" title="And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,">Acts 16:20</a>) and Ephesus (<a href="/acts/19-23.htm" title="And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.">Acts 19:23</a>). City and wilderness (possibly the Arabian desert of <a href="/galatians/1-17.htm" title="Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.">Galatians 1:17</a>; possibly the high table-lands of Armenia and Asia Minor) and sea were alike fruitful in dangers. As if with something like a climax he reserves the word "false brethren," such as those of <a href="/galatians/2-4.htm" title="And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:">Galatians 2:4</a>, as the last and worst of his trials. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In journeyings often.</span> In those days and in those countries journeys were not only perilous and fatiguing, but also accompanied with many severe hardships and discomforts. <span class="cmt_word">In perils of waters;</span> rather, <span class="accented">of rivers</span>.
