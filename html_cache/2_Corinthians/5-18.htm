In the broader context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the transformation and new creation that believers experience through Christ. The phrase underscores that salvation and reconciliation are not human achievements but are initiated and completed by God. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which highlights that salvation is a gift from God, not a result of works.<p><b>who reconciled us to Himself through Christ</b><br>Reconciliation is a central theme in Paul's writings, referring to the restoration of the relationship between God and humanity, which was broken by sin. The use of "through Christ" indicates that Jesus is the mediator of this reconciliation. This is consistent with <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, which identifies Jesus as the sole mediator between God and humans. The concept of reconciliation also ties back to the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, where atonement was made through sacrifices, foreshadowing Christ's ultimate sacrifice.<p><b>and gave us the ministry of reconciliation</b><br>This phrase highlights the responsibility given to believers to continue the work of reconciliation. The "ministry of reconciliation" involves sharing the message of the gospel and encouraging others to be reconciled to God. This is a call to evangelism and discipleship, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The early church, as described in Acts, actively engaged in this ministry, spreading the message of Christ's reconciliation throughout the Roman Empire.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who initiates reconciliation with humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>The mediator through whom reconciliation is accomplished.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle writing to the Corinthians, explaining the ministry of reconciliation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthians.htm">Corinthians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled church in Corinth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/ministry_of_reconciliation.htm">Ministry of Reconciliation</a></b><br>The mission given to believers to spread the message of reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_initiative.htm">Divine Initiative</a></b><br>God is the initiator of reconciliation.
