This introduction indicates the importance of transparency and communication within the body of Christ. Paul&#8217;s desire for the Corinthians to be informed reflects the early church's emphasis on mutual support and shared experiences, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>, where believers shared all things in common.<p><b>of the hardships we encountered in the province of Asia</b><br>The "province of Asia" refers to a Roman province in what is now western Turkey. This area included cities like Ephesus, where Paul faced significant opposition (<a href="/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23-41</a>). The hardships likely included both physical persecution and spiritual challenges. The cultural context of Asia Minor, with its diverse religious practices and strong pagan influences, often led to conflicts for early Christians. Paul's experiences in Asia are a testament to the trials faced by those spreading the Gospel in hostile environments.<p><b>We were under a burden far beyond our ability to endure</b><br>This phrase highlights the severity of the trials Paul and his companions faced. The language suggests an overwhelming pressure, possibly both physical and emotional. This echoes the biblical theme of human weakness contrasted with divine strength, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>, where Paul speaks of God's power being made perfect in weakness. The acknowledgment of human limitations serves to point believers to reliance on God's strength.<p><b>so that we despaired even of life</b><br>Paul's admission of despair underscores the depth of his suffering. This level of despair is rare in Paul's writings, indicating an extreme situation. It serves as a reminder of the reality of suffering in the Christian life, aligning with Jesus' own experiences of anguish, such as in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-38.htm">Matthew 26:38</a>). This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of suffering leading to greater reliance on God, as seen in the story of Job and the Psalms of lament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians, sharing his personal experiences and struggles to encourage and teach the church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthians.htm">Corinthians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Corinth, who were being informed about Paul's trials to strengthen their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/province_of_asia.htm">Province of Asia</a></b><br>A region in the Roman Empire where Paul faced significant hardships, likely referring to Ephesus or surrounding areas.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hardships.htm">Hardships</a></b><br>The severe trials and afflictions Paul and his companions faced, which were overwhelming and life-threatening.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_christian_suffering.htm">The Reality of Christian Suffering</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s transparency about his struggles reminds us that suffering is a part of the Christian journey.

The words "in Asia" suggest a wider range of suffering, such as we find referred to in the speech to the elders at Miletus (<a href="/acts/20-19.htm" title="Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:">Acts 20:19</a>), and the context leads us to think of bodily illness as well as of perils and anxieties. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant.</span> This is a favourite phrase with St. Paul (<a href="/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>). Of our trouble; rather, <span class="accented">about our affliction</span>. He assumes that they are aware what the trouble was, and he does not specially mention it. What he wants them to know is that, by the help of their prayers and sympathy, God had delivered him out of this affliction, crushing as it was. <span class="cmt_word">Which came to us in Asia.</span> Most commentators refer this to the tumult at Ephesus (<a href="/acts/19.htm">Acts 19</a>.); and since St. Paul's dangers, sicknesses, and troubles are clearly <span class="accented">understated</span> throughout the Acts, it is possible that the perils and personal maltreatment which were liable to occur during such a season of excitement may have brought on some violent illness; or, again, be may have suffered from some plots (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>, 32; <a href="/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>) or shipwreck (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>). In <a href="/romans/16-4.htm">Romans 16:4</a> he alludes again to some extreme peril. But St. Paul seems systematically to have made light of external dangers and sufferings. All his strongest expressions (see <a href="/romans/9-1.htm">Romans 9:1-3</a>, etc.) are reserved for mental anguish and affliction. What he felt most keenly was the pang of lacerated affections. It is, therefore, possible that he is here alluding to the overpowering tumult of feelings which had been aroused by his anxiety as to the reception likely to be accorded to his first letter. To this and the accompanying circumstances he alludes again and again (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4, 12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>, etc.). The sense of "comfort" resulting from the tidings brought by Titus (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6, 7, 13</a>) is as strong as that expressed in these verses, and the allusion to this anguish of heart is specially appropriate here, because he is dwelling on the sympathetic communion between himself and his converts, both in their sorrows and their consolations. <span class="cmt_word">That we were pressed cut of measure, above strength;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that toe were weighed down exceedingly beyond our power</span>. The trial seemed too heavy for him to bear. The phrase here rendered "out of measure" occurs in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href="/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13</a>; but is only found in this particular group of letters. <span class="cmt_word">Insomuch that we despaired even of life.</span> This rendering conveys the meaning. Literally it is, <span class="accented">so that we were even in utter perplexity</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>) <span class="accented">even about life</span>. "I fell into such agony of mind that I hardly hoped to survive." Generally, although he was often in perplexity, he succeeded in resisting despair (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We do not want</span><br /><span class="grk">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(thelomen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2309.htm">Strong's 2309: </a> </span><span class="str2">To will, wish, desire, be willing, intend, design. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
