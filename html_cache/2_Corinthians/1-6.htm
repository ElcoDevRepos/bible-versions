The apostle often faced persecution and hardship (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>), which he endured for the sake of spreading the Gospel. This reflects the biblical principle that suffering can lead to spiritual growth and benefit others (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-14</a>). The concept of affliction leading to comfort and salvation is rooted in the idea that trials can refine faith and bring believers closer to God (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>). Historically, the early church faced significant persecution, and Paul's experiences would resonate with his audience, who were familiar with suffering for their faith.<p><b>if we are comforted, it is for your comfort,</b><br>Paul highlights that any comfort he receives from God is not solely for his benefit but also for the Corinthians. This reflects the communal nature of the early Christian church, where believers were encouraged to support and uplift one another (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>). The comfort Paul refers to is not merely emotional relief but a deep, spiritual consolation that comes from God (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a>). This divine comfort equips believers to endure trials and to comfort others in their afflictions, creating a cycle of encouragement and support within the body of Christ.<p><b>which accomplishes in you patient endurance</b><br>The phrase underscores the transformative power of comfort in producing patient endurance. This endurance is a steadfastness in faith despite trials, a theme prevalent throughout the New Testament (<a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3-5</a>). The Greek word for endurance, "hypomon&#275;," implies a perseverance that is active and hopeful, not passive resignation. This endurance is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>) and is essential for spiritual maturity. The early Christians, including those in Corinth, were often called to endure persecution and hardship, making this message particularly relevant.<p><b>of the same sufferings we experience.</b><br>Paul connects his sufferings with those of the Corinthians, emphasizing shared experiences and solidarity in Christ. This mutual suffering creates a bond among believers, as they partake in the sufferings of Christ (<a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). The early church understood suffering as a part of the Christian journey, often seen as a participation in the redemptive work of Jesus (<a href="/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>). This shared experience of suffering and comfort strengthens the community and encourages believers to remain faithful amidst trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth.

That testimony becomes a powerful lesson for every observer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it is for your comfort and salvation;</b><p>Paul&#8217;s pain is never wasted. God channels it toward two outcomes for the Corinthians:<p>&#8226; Comfort&#8212;an internal strengthening that flows from &#8220;the Father of mercies and God of all comfort&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Salvation&#8212;the ongoing work of deliverance that began at conversion and continues until glory (<a href="/philippians/1-19.htm">Philippians 1:19</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10</a>).<p>As in <a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-14</a>, imprisonment and persecution advance the gospel by emboldening others and clarifying what matters most.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if we are comforted,</b><p>The same God who permits affliction also steps in with refreshing encouragement. Paul experienced that when &#8220;God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the arrival of Titus&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Comfort can arrive through believers, through Scripture (<a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>), or by a direct touch of the Spirit.<p>&#8226; Each instance of relief reminds the church that God is intimately involved in everyday struggle (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it is for your comfort,</b><p>Paul&#8217;s consolations spill over to the believers: &#8220;He comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The Corinthians are not passive spectators; they become reservoirs of the same encouragement.<p>&#8226; Shared stories of deliverance build unity and mutual care (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which accomplishes in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we experience.</b><p>The divine purpose behind comfort is endurance&#8212;remaining under the load without quitting.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a> links endurance to spiritual maturity, showing why God values it so highly.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a> states, &#8220;You need to persevere, so that after you have done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised.&#8221;<p>The Corinthians will face many of the same battles Paul fights (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-7.htm">2 Corinthians 1:7</a>), and the comfort they receive now equips them to stand firm tomorrow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s message is simple yet profound: whatever happens to God&#8217;s servants&#8212;crushing affliction or uplifting consolation&#8212;God turns it into blessing for His people. Suffering becomes a lesson in grace; comfort becomes fuel for perseverance. The church that watches and shares in both discovers patient endurance and progresses in salvation, proving once again that &#8220;in all things God works for the good of those who love Him&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And whether we be afflicted . . .</span>--The better MSS. present some variations in the order of the clauses, some of them giving the words "and our hope of you is steadfast" after "which we also suffer" in this verse. The variation hardly affects the sense in any appreciable degree. That sense is that each stage of the Apostle's experience, that of affliction no less than that of consolation, tended to make others sharers in the latter and not in the former.<p><span class= "bld">For your consolation and salvation.</span>--The latter word is added as presenting, in modern phrase, the objective side of the result of which St. Paul speaks, while the former gives prominence to the subjective. There was not only the sense of being comforted: there was also the actual deliverance from all real evil, expressed by the word "salvation." But this deliverance is seen, not in a mere escape from, or avoidance of, sufferings, but in a patient, steadfast endurance of them.<p><span class= "bld">Which is effectual.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">which worketh.</span> The word is the same as in "faith working by love" in <a href="/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Which we also suffer.</span>--What these are has not yet been specifically stated. It is assumed that the sufferings of all Christians have much in common. All have to suffer persecution from without (<a href="/acts/14-22.htm" title="Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.">Acts 14:22</a>). All have anxieties, sorrows, disappointments, which bring a keener pain than the ills that threaten the spoiling of goods or even life itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but</span>. The verse expresses the additional thought that the comfort (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. encouragement and strengthening) of the apostle, as well as his affliction, was not only designed for his own spiritual training, but was the source of direct blessing to his converts, because it enabled him, both by example (<a href="/philippians/1-14.htm">Philippians 1:14</a>) and by the lessons of experience, to strengthen others in affliction, and so to further their salvation by teaching them how to endure (Romans 5:34).
