This phrase sets the stage for encouraging them to apply their excellence to the act of giving. The church in Corinth was known for its spiritual gifts (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5-7</a>), and Paul uses this recognition to motivate them further.<p><b>in faith</b><br>Faith is foundational in the Christian life, and the Corinthians are commended for their strong belief and trust in God. This aligns with <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which states that without faith, it is impossible to please God. Their faith is a testament to their relationship with Christ and their reliance on His promises.<p><b>in speech</b><br>The Corinthians are noted for their eloquence and ability to communicate effectively. This could refer to their use of spiritual gifts such as prophecy and teaching (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8-10</a>). Speech is a powerful tool for spreading the Gospel, and Paul encourages them to use it wisely.<p><b>in knowledge</b><br>Knowledge here refers to understanding spiritual truths and doctrines. The Corinthians were known for their intellectual pursuits, and Paul acknowledges their grasp of Christian teachings. This echoes the importance of growing in the knowledge of God as seen in <a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>.<p><b>in complete earnestness</b><br>Earnestness indicates sincerity and zeal in their faith journey. The Corinthians are encouraged to maintain their fervor and dedication, reminiscent of <a href="/romans/12-11.htm">Romans 12:11</a>, which urges believers to be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.<p><b>and in the love we inspired in you</b><br>Paul highlights the love that has been cultivated within the Corinthian church, likely through his own ministry and example. This love is a reflection of the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>) and is essential for Christian community and witness.<p><b>see that you also excel in this grace of giving</b><br>Paul shifts focus to the act of giving, urging the Corinthians to apply their excellence to generosity. This grace of giving is a reflection of God's own generosity and is a practical expression of their faith and love.

He opens, as was his manner, with words of praise, and dexterously combines the gifts of "utterance and knowledge," which he had acknowledged before (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="That in every thing you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;">1Corinthians 1:5</a>), with the "earnestness and love" of which he had spoken in this very Epistle (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.">2Corinthians 7:12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And in your love to us.</span>--Some MSS. give the reading "our love for you," but that in the text has abundant authority, and gives a far better meaning. The English expresses the general meaning, but there is a subtle delicacy in the Greek: "the love which, flowing from you, rests in us as its object." The other reading would convey the sense of "the love which, flowing from us--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from our teaching and influence--now dwells in you, and shows itself in act." In any case, he is praising them for a quality which is actually theirs.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but</span>. In the following verses to ver. 15 he tells them his wishes about this collection. He desires them to show generosity among their other graces (ver. 7), not by way of command, but that they may emulate others and show their love (ver. 8) by following the example of Christ (ver. 9). And by acting thus they would prove the sincerity of their former promises (vers. 10, 11), especially as he did not wish them to give more than they could justly spare by way of reciprocity (vers. 12-15). <span class="cmt_word">As ye abound in every thing, in faith,</span> etc. Perhaps "by faith," etc., "St. Paul," says Grotius, "knew the art of the orators to move by praising."
