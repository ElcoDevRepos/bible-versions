The Law itself is &#8220;holy, righteous, and good&#8221; (<a href="/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>), yet its ministry is to expose guilt, not to impart life (<a href="/galatians/3-21.htm">Galatians 3:21&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; By using &#8220;if,&#8221; Paul begins a greater-to-lesser argument: if even a covenant that ends in condemnation carried glory, the New Covenant must carry more.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which was engraved in letters on stone</b><p>&#8226;

<a href="/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast Paul will draw is between fixed letters on stone and the living Spirit writing on human hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at the face of Moses</b><p>&#8226;

The Israelites&#8217; inability to look steadily at Moses underscores humanity&#8217;s distance from God under the Law (<a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because of its fleeting glory</b><p>&#8226;

(<a href="/2_corinthians/3-11.htm">2 Corinthians 3:11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul is preparing to reveal the surpassing, permanent glory that belongs to the Spirit-empowered New Covenant (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a> teaches that the Law&#8212;though holy&#8212;served a &#8220;ministry of death,&#8221; exposing sin and pronouncing judgment. Even so, it was delivered with unmistakable divine glory, evidenced by Moses&#8217; shining face. Yet that glory was transient, signaling the Old Covenant&#8217;s limited, preparatory role. If a covenant that could only condemn arrived in such splendor, the New Covenant, which grants righteousness and life through the Spirit, must be infinitely more glorious.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">engraved in a writing </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in a written formula) <span class= "ital">upon stones.</span> The word for "writing" is the same as the "letter" of the preceding verse, and the whole might, perhaps, be best translated, <span class= "ital">if the ministration of death in the letter, engraved upon stones, was glorious.</span> The English version, by using the two participles, creates a false antithesis between "written" and "engraved," and misses the sequence of thought indicated by the continued use of the word for "letter" or "writing." For "was glorious," more accurately, <span class= "ital">came into being with glory.</span> The thoughts of the Apostle have travelled to the record of the circumstances connected with the giving of the Law as the foundation of the first covenant, and of them he proceeds to speak fully. We can almost picture him to ourselves as taking up his LXX. version of the Law, and reproducing its very words and thoughts.<p><span class= "bld">So that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold . . .</span>--The narrative in <a href="/context/exodus/34-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.">Exodus 34:29-35</a> records that when Moses came down from the mount with the second tables of stone, "the skin of his face shone," and the "people were afraid to draw nigh unto him." The English version--that "<span class= "ital">till</span> Moses had done speaking with them he put a vail on his face," and that "when he went in before the Lord he took it off until he came out"--suggests the thought that he appeared to the people, after the first manifestation of the unconscious glory, as a veiled prophet. It is doubtful, however, whether this is the natural meaning of the Hebrew, and <a href="/exodus/34-35.htm" title="And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.">Exodus 34:35</a> repeats the statement that the Israelites saw the glory. The LXX., Vulgate, and most modern versions give, "When he ceased speaking he put a veil on his face." They saw the brightness, they shrank from it in awe, they were not allowed to watch it to the end and gaze on its disappearance. This was the sequence of facts that St. Paul had in his thoughts, and which he certainly found in the LXX.; and it is of this, accordingly, that he speaks. The children of Israel could not bear to look on the glory, even though it was perishing and evanescent. The English rendering, "which glory was to be done away," reads into the participle a gerundial force that does not properly belong to it; and it may be noted that it is the first of the great English versions that does so, the others giving, "which is made void," or "which is done away." It would be better expressed, perhaps, by, <span class= "ital">which was in the act of passing away.</span> The Greek word is the same as that on which our translators have rung so many changes in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.">1Corinthians 13:8-11</a>. It was a favourite word with St. Paul at this period of his life, occurring twenty-two times in 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans, and three times only in his other Epistles.<p>It may be noted that the Vulgate rendering of <a href="/exodus/34-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.">Exodus 34:29</a>, "<span class= "ital">ignorabat quod cornuta esset facies ejus</span>" (<span class= "ital">"</span>he knew not that his face was horned"), has given rise to the representations of Moses with horns, or rays of light taking the place of horns, as in Michael Angelo's statue in the church of San Pietro in Vincoli at Rome, and pictorial representations generally.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ministration of death.</span> The ministration, that is, of the Law, of "the letter which killeth." St. Paul here begins one of the arguments <span class="accented">a minori ad majus</span> which are the very basis of the Epistle to the Hebrews. <span class="cmt_word">Written and engraven in stones;</span> literally, <span class="accented">engraved in letters on stones</span> (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). The reference shows that, in speaking of "the letter," St. Paul was only thinking of the Mosaic Law, and indeed specifically of the Decalogue. <span class="cmt_word">Was glorious;</span> literally, <span class="accented">occurred in glory</span>, or, <span class="accented">proved itself glorious</span>. In itself the Law was "holy, just, and good" (<a href="/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>), and given "at the disposition of angels" (<a href="/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>); and its transitory glory was illustrated by the lustre which the face of Moses caught by reflection from his intercourse with God (<a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses</span> (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29, 30</a>). St. Paul has been led quite incidentally into this digression in the course of defending himself by describing the nature of his ministry; but it bore very definitely on his general purpose, because his chief opponents were Judaists, whose one aim it was to bind upon the Church the yoke of Mosaism. That they could not "behold" the face of Moses is the <span class="accented">hagadah</span>, or traditional legend, derived from <a href="/exodus/34-30.htm">Exodus 34:30</a>, which says that "they were afraid to <span class="accented">draw nigh</span> to him. The reader may recall the beautiful lines of Cardinal Newman- <p><span class="accented">"Lord l grant me this abiding grace -<br />Thy words and saints to know;<br />To pierce the veil on Moses' face,<br />Although his words be slow."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Because of the glory of his countenance.</span> This circumstance is so often alluded to as to have become identified with the conception of Moses. The Hebrew words for "a ray of light" and "a horn" are identical; hence, instead of saying that his face was "irradiated," the Vulgate says, <span class="accented">Cornnta erat ejus facies</span>; and even in our version of <a href="/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a> we find "And he had <span class="accented">horns</span> [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. 'rays of light'] coming out of his hand." To this is due the mediaeval symbol of Moses with horns, as in the matchless statue by Michael Angelo. <span class="cmt_word">Which glory was to be done away.</span> The Greek might be expressed by "the glory - the evanescing glory - of his countenance." It was not "to <span class="accented">be</span> done away," but from the first moment they saw it it began to vanish. The verb "to do away," implying annulment, and the being abrogated as invalid, is a characteristic word in this group cf Epistles, in which it occurs twenty-two times. This illustrates the prominence in St. Paul's thoughts of the fact that the Law was now "antiquated" and "near its obliteration" (comp. <a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>). But in dwelling on the brief and transient character of this radiance, St. Paul seizes on a point which (naturally) is not dwelt upon in <a href="/exodus/34.htm">Exodus 34</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
