It served as a strategic location for travel and trade, making it an ideal place for the spread of the gospel. The Apostle Paul visited Troas multiple times during his missionary journeys (<a href="/acts/16-8.htm">Acts 16:8, 20</a>:5-12). This visit to Troas is part of Paul's second missionary journey, highlighting his commitment to spreading the message of Christ across diverse regions.<p><b>to preach the gospel of Christ</b><br>Paul's primary mission was to preach the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection for the salvation of humanity. This phrase underscores the centrality of Christ in Paul's message and mission. The gospel of Christ is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, emphasizing salvation by grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>) and the transformative power of the gospel (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). Paul's dedication to this mission reflects the Great Commission given by Jesus to His disciples (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>and a door stood open for me in the Lord</b><br>The imagery of an "open door" is often used in the New Testament to signify opportunities for ministry and the advancement of the gospel (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>, <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>). This phrase suggests that God had providentially prepared the way for Paul's ministry in Troas, indicating divine approval and support. The concept of an open door also implies that Paul was sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit, recognizing and seizing opportunities to fulfill his calling. This aligns with the biblical principle that God directs the paths of those who trust in Him (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians.

(See Note on <a href="/acts/9-35.htm" title="And all that dwelled at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.">Acts 9:35</a>.) The case of the offender had come in as a parenthesis in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/2-5.htm" title="But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.">2Corinthians 2:5-8</a>. He returns to the train of thought which it had interrupted, and continues his narrative of what had passed after he had written the First Epistle. (On Troas, see Notes on <a href="/acts/16-8.htm" title="And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.">Acts 16:8</a>.) A Church had probably been founded in that city by St. Luke, but St. Paul's first visit to it had been limited to a few days, and there are no traces of his preaching there. Now he comes "for the gospel's sake." That there was a flourishing Christian community some months later, we find from <a href="/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>.<p><span class= "bld">A door was opened unto me.</span>--Opportunities for mission-work, as we should call them, are thus described in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm" title="For a great door and effectual is opened to me, and there are many adversaries.">1Corinthians 16:9</a>. There is something of the nature of a coincidence in his using it of two different churches, Ephesus and Troas, within a comparatively short interval. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-17.</span> <span class="accented">- Outburst of thanksgiving for the news brought by Titus</span>.' <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Furthermore, when I came to Troas.</span> "Furthermore" is too strong for the "but" of the original. There is an apparently abrupt transition, but the apostle is only resuming the narrative which he broke off at ver. 4 in order that he might finish the topic of the painful circumstance in which his First Epistle had originated. <span class="accented">To Troas</span>. Not "the Troas." St. Paul had to do with the city, not with the district. The city (now <span class="accented">Eski Stamboul</span>), of which the name had been changed from <span class="accented">Antigonia Troas</span> to <span class="accented">Alexandria Troas</span>, was at this time a flourishing colony (<span class="accented">Colonia Juris Italici</span>), highly favoured by the Romans as representing ancient Troy, and therefore as being the mythological cradle of their race. He visited it on his being driven from Ephesus after the tumult, a little earlier than he would naturally have left it. He had visited Troas in his second missionary journey (<a href="/acts/16-8.htm">Acts 16:8-11</a>), but had left it in consequence of the vision which called him to Macedonia. He now stopped there on his journey through Macedonia to Corinth, which he had announced in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And a door was opened unto me of the Lord;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and a door had been opened to me in the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> and I found there a marked opportunity (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>) for work in Christ. Some commentators, in that spirit of superfluous disquisition and idle letter-worship which is the bane of exegesis, here venture to discuss whether St. Paul was justified in neglecting this opportunity or not. Such discussions are only originated by not observing characteristic modes of expression. St. Paul merely means" circumstances would <span class="accented">otherwise</span> have been very favourable for my preaching of Christ; but I was in such a state of miserable anxiety that I lacked the strength to avail myself of them." He was no more responsible for this state of mind, which belonged to his natural temperament, than he would have been responsible for a serious illness. To say that he <span class="accented">ought</span> to have had strength of mind enough to get the mastery over his feelings is only to say that Paul ought not to have been Paul. The neglect to use the opportunity was a "hindrance" which might in one sense be assigned to God, and in another to Satan. Moreover, that the opportunity was <span class="accented">not</span> wholly lost appears from the fact that St. Paul found a flourishing Christian community at Troas when he visit, d it on his return from this very journey (<a href="/acts/20-6.htm">Acts 20:6, 7</a>), and that he stayed there at least once again, shortly before his martyrdom (<a href="/2_timothy/4-13.htm">2 Timothy 4:13</a>). Indeed, it was probably at Troas that his <span class="accented">final</span> arrest took place (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 2:569, 576). <span class="accented">Of the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the sphere of Christian work. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when I went</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Elth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Troas</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#961;&#8179;&#940;&#948;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Tr&#333;ada)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5174.htm">Strong's 5174: </a> </span><span class="str2">Troas, a harbor city of Mysia.
