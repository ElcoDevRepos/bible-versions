The early church often faced fluctuating circumstances, and Paul is addressing a current situation. The immediacy of the phrase suggests a call to action, emphasizing the urgency of responding to the needs of fellow believers.<p><b>your surplus will meet their need</b><br>Paul is encouraging the Corinthian church to use their excess resources to support the Jerusalem church, which was experiencing poverty and hardship. This reflects the principle of stewardship and generosity found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where early Christians shared everything they had. The concept of surplus here is not just financial but can also include spiritual and emotional support.<p><b>so that in turn their surplus will meet your need</b><br>This phrase suggests a reciprocal relationship within the body of Christ, where mutual support and care are emphasized. It reflects the interconnectedness of the church, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>, where Paul describes the church as one body with many parts. The idea is that what one group lacks, another can provide, fostering unity and interdependence.<p><b>This way there will be equality</b><br>Paul's vision for equality is not about uniformity but about ensuring that no one lacks what is necessary. This reflects the biblical principle of justice and fairness, as seen in the Old Testament laws regarding gleaning and the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25). The early church's practice of sharing resources (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-35</a>) serves as a model for this kind of equality, where the needs of all members are met through communal support.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians, encouraging them to contribute to the needs of the Jerusalem church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthians.htm">Corinthians</a></b><br>- The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Corinth, known for their spiritual gifts but also for their struggles with unity and morality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_church.htm">Jerusalem Church</a></b><br>- The early Christian community in Jerusalem, which was experiencing financial hardship and needed support from other churches.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/macedonian_churches.htm">Macedonian Churches</a></b><br>- Mentioned earlier in the chapter as an example of generosity despite their own poverty, inspiring the Corinthians to give.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/collection_for_the_saints.htm">Collection for the Saints</a></b><br>- The event of gathering financial support from various churches to aid the impoverished believers in Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_equality.htm">Principle of Equality</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes the importance of equality within the body of Christ.

The Church of Jerusalem was at this time suffering from poverty, and, therefore, St. Paul exhorts the Corinthians to come to its assistance. A time might come in which their relative position would be inverted, and then he would plead not less earnestly that Jerusalem should assist Corinth. It is reading too much between the lines to see in the words the thought which the Apostle expresses elsewhere (<a href="/romans/15-27.htm" title="It has pleased them truly; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things.">Romans 15:27</a>), that the equality of which he speaks consisted in the Corinthians giving money and receiving spiritual privileges. But for the fact that controversial ingenuity is "capable of anything," it might have been thought impossible to see in them the doctrine that men are to give to the poor in order that, in their time of need, in the hour of death, and in the day of judgment, they might receive from them a transfer of their superfluous merits. And yet this has actually been done by Roman Catholic commentators--even by such as Estius.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But by an equality,</span> etc. The verse, like so many in this chapter, is expressed very elliptically: "But by a reciprocal fairness in the present case, your superabundance to their lack, that also their superabundance may be in proportion to your lack, that there may come to be reciprocal fairness." St. Paul may possibly be thinking of the reciprocity of spiritual and temporal benefits, as in <a href="/romans/15-27.htm">Romans 15:27</a>; but if so he leaves the thought unexpressed. The application of the text to "works of supererogation" (Art. XIV.), as forming a fund at the disposal of the hierarchy in the way of indulgences, pardons, etc., is a singular perversion. The passage has been pointed out by Dean Stanley as one which indicates a <span class="accented">possible</span> acquaintance with the writings of Aristotle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/8-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
