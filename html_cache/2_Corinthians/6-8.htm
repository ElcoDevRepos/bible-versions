Glory refers to the honor and respect they received from those who accepted their message, while dishonor points to the shame and rejection from those who opposed them. This duality reflects the life of Jesus, who was both glorified by His followers and dishonored by His detractors. The early church often faced persecution, as seen in <a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>, where the apostles rejoiced for being counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name of Jesus.<p><b>slander and praise</b><br>Slander involves false accusations and malicious talk, which the apostles frequently encountered from those who opposed their teachings. Praise, on the other hand, came from those who recognized the truth of their message and the power of God at work in them. This contrast is evident in the life of Paul, who was often slandered by Jewish leaders (<a href="/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>) but praised by the Gentile converts who embraced the gospel. The experience of slander and praise is a testament to the spiritual battle between truth and falsehood.<p><b>viewed as imposters, yet genuine</b><br>The apostles were often accused of being imposters, deceiving people with false teachings. This accusation was common in a culture where new religious movements were met with skepticism. However, their genuineness was proven through their consistent message, miracles, and the transformation of lives. This mirrors the accusations against Jesus, who was called a deceiver (<a href="/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a>) but was ultimately vindicated by His resurrection.
