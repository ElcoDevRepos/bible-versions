In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the Corinthian church, which had been influenced by false apostles who boasted of their own abilities. Paul contrasts this by acknowledging that human ability is limited and insufficient for spiritual tasks. This echoes the biblical theme of human weakness and reliance on God, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, where Jesus says, "Apart from me you can do nothing."<p><b>to claim that anything comes from us</b><br>Paul underscores that any spiritual success or ability is not self-derived. This reflects the broader biblical teaching that all good things come from God (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). In the cultural context of Corinth, a city known for its intellectualism and rhetoric, this statement would challenge the prevailing notion of self-sufficiency and personal achievement. It aligns with the humility taught in <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>, where believers are encouraged to consider others better than themselves.<p><b>but our competence comes from God</b><br>Here, Paul attributes all spiritual competence to God, affirming divine empowerment. This is consistent with the biblical narrative of God equipping those He calls, as seen in the stories of Moses (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10-12</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6-9</a>). Theologically, this points to the work of the Holy Spirit, who empowers believers for ministry (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). It also reflects the idea of grace, where God provides what is needed for His purposes, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>, where believers are created in Christ Jesus for good works prepared by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, emphasizing the source of his and his companions' competence in ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and significant cultural influence.

In the Greek there are two different prepositions for the one "of" in English. "Not as though we are sufficient of ourselves to form any estimate as originating with ourselves," would be a fair paraphrase. The habit of mind which led St. Paul to emphasise the shades of meaning in Greek prepositions to an extent hardly to be expressed in English, and not commonly recognised, it may be, in colloquial Greek, is seen again in <a href="/romans/11-36.htm" title="For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever.
