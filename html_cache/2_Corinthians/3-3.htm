In the ancient world, letters were a primary means of communication, and here, the believers themselves are depicted as a living letter, showcasing the message of Christ. This metaphor highlights the personal and relational nature of the gospel, contrasting with the impersonal nature of written documents. The idea of believers as a letter from Christ underscores the authenticity and divine origin of their faith, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:8-9</a>, where the faith of the Thessalonians is known everywhere.<p><b>the result of our ministry</b><br>Paul refers to the ministry he and his companions conducted in Corinth, which was marked by preaching, teaching, and personal discipleship. This ministry was not just about words but about the power of the Holy Spirit working through them, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4-5</a>. The transformation of the Corinthians is evidence of the effectiveness of Paul's apostolic mission, aligning with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God</b><br>This contrast between ink and the Spirit highlights the superiority of the new covenant over the old. Ink represents the old way of the law, which was external and written on scrolls or tablets. The Spirit of the living God signifies the new covenant, which is internal and transformative, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God promises to write His law on the hearts of His people. This internalization of God's law is a key aspect of the new covenant, fulfilled through the work of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>not on tablets of stone</b><br>This phrase alludes to the Mosaic Law, which was given on stone tablets (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). The stone tablets symbolize the old covenant, which was external and could not change the heart. The law served as a tutor to lead people to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>), revealing sin but not providing the power to overcome it. The reference to stone tablets also recalls the giving of the Ten Commandments, a foundational moment in Israel's history, emphasizing the shift from the old covenant to the new.<p><b>but on tablets of human hearts</b><br>The imagery of writing on human hearts signifies the intimate and transformative work of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives. This fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give His people a new heart and put a new spirit within them. The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of a person's being, including their will, emotions, and intellect. The transformation of the heart is a hallmark of the new covenant, made possible through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, who enables believers to live in obedience to God through the indwelling Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, emphasizing the spiritual transformation of believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, representing the early Christian community in Corinth, known for its diversity and challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central to the message, as the one who transforms believers into living letters through the Spirit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_the_living_god.htm">The Spirit of the Living God</a></b><br>The divine agent who writes on the hearts of believers, signifying the new covenant.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tablets_of_stone.htm">Tablets of Stone</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Covenant, specifically the Ten Commandments given to Moses, contrasting with the new covenant written on hearts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_living_letter_of_christ.htm">The Living Letter of Christ</a></b><br>Believers are living testimonies of Christ's work, reflecting His character and message to the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The transformation of the heart is a work of the Holy Spirit, not human effort, emphasizing reliance on divine power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_covenant.htm">The New Covenant</a></b><br>The shift from external adherence to internal transformation marks the new covenant, inviting believers to a deeper relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heart_transformation.htm">Heart Transformation</a></b><br>True change begins in the heart, where God's Spirit writes His laws, leading to genuine obedience and love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/ministry_as_a_partnership_with_god.htm">Ministry as a Partnership with God</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s ministry serves as a conduit for God&#8217;s work, reminding believers of their role in partnering with God to impact others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Corinthians_3_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Corinthians 3:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Cor_3_3_Believers_as_Christ_s_letter.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 3:3 describe believers as "a letter from Christ"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_Spirit_in_transformation.htm">What role does the "Spirit of the living God" play in transformation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_live_lives_written_not_with_ink.htm">How can we ensure our lives reflect being "written not with ink"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/2_Cor_3_3_Jer_31_33_New_Covenant_link.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 3:3 connect with the New Covenant in Jeremiah 31:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_everyone_know_and_read_us_today_2.htm">In what ways can we be "known and read by everyone" today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_is_a_letter_from_Christ_in_2_Cor_3_3.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 3:3 define the concept of a "letter from Christ"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Spirit_not_ink_imply.htm">What does "written not with ink but with the Spirit" imply about divine inspiration?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Does_2_Cor_3_3_question_physical_texts.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 3:3 challenge the necessity of physical scriptures?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_corinthians_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Corinthians 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_is_a_spiritual_letter_more_authoritative.htm">In 2 Corinthians 3:3, how can an intangible &#8220;spiritual&#8221;

The verse celebrates the glory of the new covenant, where God Himself writes His life into His people, making them visible proof of the transforming power of Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Forasmuch, as ye are manifestly declared.</span>--The metaphor appears to shift its ground from the subjective to the objective. It is not only as written in his heart, but as seen and known by others, that they (the Corinthians) are as a letter of commendation. They are as a letter which Christ had written as with the finger of God. That letter, he adds, was "ministered by us." He had been, that is, as the <span class= "ital">amanuensis</span> of that letter, but Christ was the real writer.<p><span class= "bld">Written not with ink.</span>--Letters were usually written on papyrus, with a reed pen and with a black pigment (<span class= "ital">atramentum</span>) used as ink. (Comp. <a href="/2_john/1-12.htm" title="Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.">2John 1:12</a>.) In contrast with this process, he speaks of the Epistle of Christ as written with the "Spirit of the living God." It is noteworthy that the Spirit takes here the place of the older "finger of God" in the history of the two tables of stone in <a href="/exodus/31-18.htm" title="And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.">Exodus 31:18</a>. So a like substitution is found in comparing "If I with the finger of God cast out devils," in <a href="/luke/11-20.htm" title="But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come on you.">Luke 11:20</a>, with "If I by the Spirit of God," in <a href="/matthew/12-28.htm" title="But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.">Matthew 12:28</a>. Traces of the same thought are found in the hymn in the Ordination service, in which the Holy Spirit is addressed as "the finger of God's hand."<p><span class= "bld">Not in tables of stone.</span>--The thought of a letter written in the heart by the Spirit of God brings three memorable passages to St. Paul's memory:--(1) the "heart of flesh" of <a href="/ezekiel/11-19.htm" title="And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/36-26.htm" title="A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>; (2) the promise that the law should be written in the heart, which was to be the special characteristic of the new covenant (<a href="/context/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31-33</a>); and (3) the whole history of the circumstances of the first, or older, covenant; and, from this verse to the end of the chapter, thought follows rapidly on thought in manifold application of the images thus suggested. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Manifestly declared.</span> The fame and centrality of Corinth gave peculiar prominence to the fact of their conversion. <span class="cmt_word">The epistle of Christ ministered by us.</span> The Corinthians are the epistle; it is written on the hearts of St. Paul and his companions; Christ was its Composer; they were its amanuenses and its conveyers. The development of the metaphor <span class="accented">as a metaphor</span> would be somewhat clumsy and intricate, but St. Paul only cares to shadow forth the essential fact which he wishes them to recognize. Not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not with visible or perishable materials, but spiritual in its origin and character. The notion of "the finger of God" naturally recalled the notion of "the Spirit of God" (comp. <a href="/matthew/12-28.htm">Matthew 12:28</a> with <a href="/luke/11-20.htm">Luke 11:20</a>). Not in tables of stone. God's writing by means of the Spirit on the heart reminds him of another writing <span class="accented">of God</span> on the stone tablets of the Law, which he therefore introduces with no special regard to the congruity of the metaphor about "an epistle." <span class="cmt_word">But in fleshy tables of the heart.</span> The overwhelming preponderance of manuscript authority supports the reading "but in fleshen tablets - hearts." St. Paul is thinking of <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, "I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;" and <a href="/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22</a>, "I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh." The tablets were not hard and fragile, but susceptible and receptive. Our letters of introduction are inward not outward, spiritual not material, permanent not perishable, legible to all not only by a few, written by Christ not by man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">It is clear</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(phaneroumenoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5319.htm">Strong's 5319: </a> </span><span class="str2">To make clear (visible, manifest), make known.
