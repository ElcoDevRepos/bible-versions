During his missionary journeys, Paul often faced financial hardships. His commitment to the gospel meant he sometimes lacked basic necessities. This phrase highlights his dedication and the reality of his missionary work, which often involved personal sacrifice. The context of his need underscores the sincerity of his ministry, contrasting with false apostles who sought financial gain.<p><b>I was not a burden to anyone;</b><br>Paul emphasizes his effort to avoid being a financial burden to the Corinthians. In the Greco-Roman world, it was common for teachers and philosophers to receive support from their students or patrons. However, Paul chose to support himself through tent-making (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>) to maintain the integrity of his message and avoid any accusations of preaching for profit. This self-sufficiency was a testament to his commitment to the gospel and his desire to serve without ulterior motives.<p><b>for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my needs.</b><br>The Macedonian churches, including those in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea, were known for their generosity despite their own poverty (<a href="/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1-2</a>). Their support of Paul is a testament to their spiritual maturity and commitment to the spread of the gospel. This phrase highlights the interconnectedness of early Christian communities and their willingness to support one another. It also serves as an example of sacrificial giving, which Paul later commends in his letters.<p><b>I have refrained from being a burden to you in any way,</b><br>Paul reiterates his commitment to not burden the Corinthians financially. This decision was strategic, as it allowed him to preach freely and maintain his independence from any potential influence or control by wealthy patrons. By refraining from accepting support, Paul could focus solely on the spiritual well-being of the Corinthians, ensuring that his message remained pure and untainted by financial concerns.<p><b>and I will continue to do so.</b><br>Paul's resolve to continue this practice underscores his dedication to the Corinthians' spiritual growth and his commitment to the integrity of his ministry. This forward-looking statement assures the Corinthians of his ongoing commitment to serve them selflessly. It also reflects Paul's understanding of his apostolic mission, which was to preach the gospel without hindrance or compromise, setting an example for future generations of Christian leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the Corinthian church.

The verse teaches that:<p>&#8226; Honest needs exist in ministry.<p>&#8226; Refusing undue financial dependence can protect young believers.<p>&#8226; God often supplies through the generosity of other saints.<p>&#8226; Consistent self-denial strengthens credibility and magnifies Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">I was chargeable to no man.</span>--There is no doubt that this gives substantially the meaning of the Greek word, but the word is a very peculiar one, and has a history which, as throwing light on the sources of St. Paul's phraseology, and his character as shown in his use of it, is not without interest. The verb (<span class= "ital">katanarkao</span>) is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, nor in the LXX. versions of the Old, nor, indeed, in any known Greek author, except Hippocrates. Jerome describes it as belonging to the <span class= "ital">patois</span> of Cilicia, which, if true, would be interesting; but he gives no proof of it (<span class= "ital">Ep. ad Aglaia</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and the statement must be treated as unproven. The history which we are about to trace, tends, however, to confirm it as a probable conjecture. The root of the verb is found in the noun <span class= "ital">narke,</span> which is used (1) for "numbness," or "torpor" (a sense found in our "narcotic"), and (2) as the name of a fish of the torpedo genus, causing numbness by its contact with the human body (Aristotle, <span class= "ital">Anim. Hist. vi.</span> 10). The verb derived from the noun is accordingly used by Hippocrates and Galen in the sense of "being benumbed," or causing numbness. (See Foesius, <span class= "ital">Lexic. Hippocrat. s.v, </span><span class= "greekheb">?????</span><span class= "ital">.</span>) As used here, it takes its place as a bold figurative expression. To benumb any one, was to exhaust him, to drain him of his vitality by pressing on him, and, as it were, living upon him. St. Paul accordingly means, in using the word, to say, "I didn't drain you of your resources--did not live upon you." An analogous similitude is found in Shakespeare's lines:--<p>"That now he was<p>The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,<p>And suck'd my verdure out on't<p>--<span class= "ital">Tempest, i.</span> 2.<p>Our modern phrase which speaks of one man as "sponging" on another implies a like metaphor. In the word "parasitic" as applied to plants and animals, we have an inverted transfer of the same idea from the incidents of man's social life to that of lower organisms. As a word belonging, through Hippocrates, to the recognised terminology of physicians, it takes its place in the vocabulary which St. Paul may be supposed to have derived from St. Luke (see <span class= "ital">Introduction</span> <span class= "ital">to St. Luke's Gospel, V</span>ol. I., p. 239), and which the fame of Tarsus as a medical school may also have made more or less familiar, as Jerome states, in the conversational idioms of Cilicia.<p><span class= "bld">The brethren which came from Macedonia supplied.</span>--Not "which came," but <span class= "ital">when they came.</span> The Acts of the Apostles present no record of any such supply, but <a href="/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Philippians 4:15</a> presents an interesting and confirmatory coincidence. The Philippians had sent supplies to him twice at Thessalonica, and it was a natural sequel to this that they should send to him also at Corinth. The Apostle may well have accepted what they thus sent, and yet have thought his acceptance perfectly compatible with his boast that he was not preaching at Corinth for the sake of gain (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-16.htm" title="For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid on me; yes, woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!">1Corinthians 9:16-18</a>). He was not to be robbed of whatever credit attached to his working for his own livelihood at Corinth and elsewhere, by any sneers which had that acceptance for their starting-point.<p><span class= "bld">And so will I keep myself.</span>--It adds to the interest of this declaration to remember that St. Paul had acted on this principle both at Ephesus, which he had just left (<a href="/acts/20-34.htm" title="Yes, you yourselves know, that these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them that were with me.">Acts 20:34</a>), and in the Macedonian churches which he was now visiting (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but worked with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:">2Thessalonians 3:8</a>). The future tense obviously points to his resolution to continue to act on the same lines during his promised visit to Corinth. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And wanted.</span> The aorist shows that this sad condition of extreme poverty was a crisis rather than chronic. Yet even at that supreme moment of trial, when from illness or accident the scanty income of his trade failed him, he would not tell <span class="accented">them</span> that he was starving, but rather accepted help from the Philippians, who, as he knew, felt for him an unfeigned affection. It is needless to point out once more how strong is the argument in favour of the genuineness of the Acts and the Epistles from the numberless undesigned coincidences between them in such passages as those to which I have referred in the foregoing notes. <span class="cmt_word">I was chargeable to no man;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">did not benumb you</span>. The word <span class="accented">katenarkesa</span>, which occurs only here and in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-13.htm">2 Corinthians 12:13, 14</a>, is ranked by St. Jerome among St. Paul's <span class="accented">cilicisms, i.e.</span> the provincial expressions which he picked up during his long residence at Tarsus. <span class="accented">Narke</span> (whence our <span class="accented">narcissus</span> and <span class="accented">narcotie</span>) means "paralysis," and is also the name given to the <span class="accented">gymnotus</span>, or electric eel - in Latin, <span class="accented">torpedo</span>, the cramp-fish - which benumbs with the shock of its touch. "I did not," he indignantly says, "cramp you with my torpedo touch." Perhaps in a less vehement mood he would have chosen a less picturesque or technical and medical term. <span class="cmt_word">That which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied;</span> rather, <span class="accented">for the brethren, on their arrival from Macedonia</span>; <span class="accented">filled up my deficiency</span>.
