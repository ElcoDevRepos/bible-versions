The term "exploit" suggests taking advantage of someone for personal gain. In the context of the early church, false apostles were known to exploit believers for financial or personal benefits. Paul contrasts his behavior with these false teachers, emphasizing his selflessness and dedication to the gospel. This echoes his earlier statements in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-7.htm">2 Corinthians 11:7-9</a>, where he mentions preaching the gospel free of charge to avoid being a burden.<p><b>by anyone I sent you?</b><br>Paul refers to his associates, such as Titus and others, whom he sent to the Corinthians. He is confident in their integrity, as they shared his values and mission. This reflects the communal nature of early Christian ministry, where leaders were expected to uphold the same standards of conduct. The mention of sending others highlights the apostolic practice of delegating responsibilities, as seen in <a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22-27</a>, where the apostles and elders sent Judas and Silas with Paul and Barnabas.

The single word &#8220;Did&#8221; signals a review of past dealings, inviting the Corinthians to recall the facts. Paul has already reminded them, &#8220;I will not be a burden to you&#8221; (12:14), echoing his earlier stance, &#8220;Was it a sin for me to humble myself&#8230; because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge?&#8221; (11:7).

Paul&#8217;s ministry was people-centered, not profit-centered. He told them, &#8220;I seek not your possessions but you&#8221; (12:14). His goal was their spiritual growth (13:9), proving love through sacrificial service (12:15).
