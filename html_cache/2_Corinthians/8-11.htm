This reflects the importance of perseverance in Christian duties. The call to "finish the work" emphasizes the need for follow-through in commitments, a principle seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, where faith without works is dead. The historical context involves the early church's practice of supporting one another, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>.<p><b>so that you may complete it</b><br>The emphasis on completion highlights the biblical principle of fulfilling one's promises and responsibilities. In the cultural context of the time, honor and integrity were highly valued, and failing to complete a task could bring shame. This mirrors Jesus' teaching in <a href="/luke/14-28.htm">Luke 14:28-30</a> about counting the cost before starting a project, ensuring one can finish it.<p><b>with the same eager desire</b><br>Paul commends the Corinthians for their initial enthusiasm and encourages them to maintain that zeal. This phrase underscores the importance of sustaining passion in service to God, akin to the fervor seen in the early church in <a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-35</a>. It also reflects the biblical theme of wholehearted devotion, as seen in <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>, where believers are urged to work heartily as for the Lord.<p><b>according to your means</b><br>Paul acknowledges the varying capacities of individuals to give, emphasizing the principle of proportional giving. This aligns with the teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>, where believers are instructed to set aside a sum of money in keeping with their income. The concept of giving according to one's means is rooted in the Old Testament, where offerings were often proportional to one's blessings, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-17.htm">Deuteronomy 16:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth to encourage them in their commitment to give generously to the collection for the saints in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Corinthians had previously expressed a desire to contribute to the collection for the Jerusalem church but had not yet completed their commitment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_collection_for_the_saints.htm">The Collection for the Saints</a></b><br>A significant event in the early church where Paul organized a collection to support the impoverished believers in Jerusalem, demonstrating unity and love among the early Christian communities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/eagerness_in_giving.htm">Eagerness in Giving</a></b><br>Paul commends the Corinthians for their initial eagerness and encourages them to maintain that enthusiasm.
