In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the Corinthian church about their commitment to support the impoverished believers in Jerusalem. The eagerness or willingness to give reflects a sincere desire to help, which is more important than the amount given. This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God values the heart over outward appearances. The eagerness to give is a reflection of the transformative work of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life, producing a cheerful and willing spirit.<p><b>the gift is acceptable</b><br>Paul reassures the Corinthians that their gift is pleasing to God when given with the right attitude. This echoes the teaching in <a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>, where Paul describes the gifts from the Philippians as a "fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God." The acceptability of the gift is not based on its size but on the sincerity and willingness behind it. This principle is rooted in the Old Testament sacrificial system, where the heart of the worshiper was crucial for the offering to be accepted by God (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>).<p><b>according to what one has</b><br>This phrase highlights the principle of proportional giving. Paul encourages believers to give in accordance with their means, which ensures that the act of giving is not burdensome. This is consistent with the teaching in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-17.htm">Deuteronomy 16:17</a>, where each person is instructed to give as they are able, according to the blessings they have received from God. It underscores the idea that God does not expect believers to give beyond their capacity, but rather to give generously from what they have been entrusted with.<p><b>not according to what he does not have</b><br>Paul clarifies that God does not require believers to give what they do not possess. This is a practical and compassionate approach, recognizing the varying economic situations of individuals within the church. It reflects the wisdom found in <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>, where honoring God with one's wealth is encouraged, but within the context of one's own resources. This teaching protects believers from feeling guilt or pressure to give beyond their means, promoting a spirit of freedom and joy in giving.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians, addressing issues of generosity and giving.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthians.htm">Corinthians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Corinth, known for their spiritual gifts but also for their struggles with unity and moral issues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/macedonian_churches.htm">Macedonian Churches</a></b><br>Mentioned earlier in the chapter as an example of generous giving despite their poverty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A fellow worker of Paul, who was sent to Corinth to help organize the collection for the Jerusalem church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_church.htm">Jerusalem Church</a></b><br>The church in Jerusalem that was in need, prompting Paul to organize a collection from the Gentile churches.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_giving.htm">The Heart of Giving</a></b><br>God values the willingness and eagerness to give more than the size of the gift.

God looks first at willingness, not wealth. Earlier in the chapter the Macedonians &#8220;gave themselves first to the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-5.htm">2 Corinthians 8:5</a>), and their joyful readiness made even their poverty-level gifts shine. The same priority is echoed in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, &#8220;God loves a cheerful giver,&#8221; and in 1 Chron 29:9 where the people &#8220;rejoiced, for they had offered willingly.&#8221; The lesson: authentic generosity starts with eagerness birthed in love for Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the gift is acceptable</b><p>Because the intent is right, the offering pleases God. Paul uses the same idea in <a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>, calling the Philippians&#8217; support &#8220;a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.&#8221; Jesus affirmed a widow&#8217;s two small coins as &#8220;more than all the others&#8221; (<a href="/luke/21-3.htm">Luke 21:3-4</a>). The Lord&#8217;s standard of acceptability rests on the giver&#8217;s devotion, not the dollar amount.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to what one has</b><p>God measures our stewardship in relation to our resources. Paul had already advised, &#8220;On the first day of every week, each of you is to set something aside&#8230;in keeping with your income&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>). Faithful giving flows from what the Lord has already placed in our hands (cf. <a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>, &#8220;to whom much is given, much will be required&#8221;). This removes comparison and highlights personal responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not according to what he does not have</b><p>The Lord never demands what He has not supplied. Paul is not pressuring the Corinthians into hardship (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-13.htm">2 Corinthians 8:13</a>). The woman who anointed Jesus &#8220;did what she could&#8221; (<a href="/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>), and Peter said, &#8220;Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give&#8221; (<a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a>). Our Father evaluates faithfulness, not fantasies; He delights in obedience within our means.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_corinthians/8-12.htm">2 Corinthians 8:12</a> teaches that God values the willing heart more than the weight of the gift. When eagerness for His glory fuels our giving, whatever we offer is acceptable. He asks us to steward the resources we possess, never expecting contributions beyond our capacity. In short, readiness plus proportionate generosity equals an offering that brings Him pleasure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">For if there be first a willing mind.</span>--This grows "out of that which ye have" in the previous verse.
