In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul defends his apostolic authority against false apostles who questioned his credentials. The phrase suggests a careful adherence to the mission God assigned him, emphasizing that his actions are within the limits set by God. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and accountability, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>, where Paul describes himself as a servant of Christ and a steward of God's mysteries.<p><b>as if we had not come to you</b><br>Paul reminds the Corinthians of his initial visit, which established the church in Corinth. This phrase underscores the historical fact that Paul was instrumental in founding the Corinthian church, as recorded in <a href="/acts/18.htm">Acts 18:1-11</a>. His personal involvement and investment in their spiritual growth give him a legitimate claim to speak into their lives. This also highlights the importance of personal relationships in ministry, as seen in Paul's other letters, such as <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7-8</a>, where he describes his nurturing approach.<p><b>Indeed, we were the first to reach you</b><br>Paul asserts his pioneering role in bringing the gospel to Corinth. This is significant because it establishes his foundational role in their spiritual journey. The phrase "first to reach you" indicates the priority of evangelism and church planting in Paul's ministry. It also reflects the fulfillment of the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and the spread of the gospel to the Gentiles, as Paul was specifically called to be an apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>).<p><b>with the gospel of Christ</b><br>The centrality of the gospel in Paul's ministry is emphasized here. The "gospel of Christ" refers to the good news of Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection, which is the core message of Christianity (<a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1-4</a>). This phrase highlights the transformative power of the gospel, which Paul preached not with eloquence or human wisdom, but with the demonstration of the Spirit's power (<a href="/1_corinthians/2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</a>). It also points to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which foretells the suffering servant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

(See Note on <a href="/matthew/12-28.htm" title="But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.">Matthew 12:28</a>.) And this is obviously St. Paul's meaning. "We were the first to come," he says, "as working within our limits; the very fact that we did so come being a proof of it." They (his rivals) came afterwards, and were intruders. On Corinth, as the then limit of his work, see Note on the preceding verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As though we reached not unto you.</span> In including you within the reach of our measuring line, we are guilty neither of presumption nor of intrusion.
