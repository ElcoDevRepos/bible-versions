In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul addresses the need for the Corinthian church to forgive a member who had previously caused distress, likely referring to the individual mentioned in <a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5</a>. Forgiveness within the community is essential for maintaining unity and reflects the teachings of Jesus, such as in <a href="/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14-15</a>, where forgiveness is tied to receiving forgiveness from God.<p><b>I also forgive him.</b><br>Paul emphasizes his authority and willingness to forgive, aligning himself with the actions of the church. This reflects the apostolic authority he holds and his role in guiding the church's spiritual health. It also demonstrates the importance of leaders modeling forgiveness, as seen in the example of Jesus, who forgave those who wronged Him (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>).<p><b>And if I have forgiven anything,</b><br>Paul's statement here is somewhat hypothetical, suggesting that if there were any other offenses, he is ready to forgive them. This reflects the comprehensive nature of Christian forgiveness, which is not limited or conditional. It echoes the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/18-21.htm">Matthew 18:21-22</a>, where forgiveness is to be extended repeatedly.<p><b>I have forgiven it in the presence of Christ</b><br>Paul's forgiveness is not merely a personal decision but is done with an awareness of Christ's presence. This indicates that forgiveness is a spiritual act, done with the consciousness of being before Christ, who is the ultimate judge and source of forgiveness. It underscores the belief that all actions, especially those involving reconciliation, are done with Christ's oversight and approval.<p><b>for your sake,</b><br>Paul's forgiveness is motivated by his concern for the Corinthian church's well-being. It highlights the communal aspect of forgiveness, where the act is not just for the individual offender but for the health and unity of the entire body of believers. This reflects the teaching in <a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>, where believers are encouraged to forgive one another as God in Christ forgave them, promoting peace and unity within the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

Though absent in body, he had made himself a sharer spiritually in that censure. He now, anticipating their compliance with his request, makes himself a sharer in the sentence of absolution.<p><span class= "bld">For if I forgave any thing.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">if I have forgiven;</span> and so in the following clauses. The case is put hypothetically, though he has an actual offender in his thoughts, because he had, in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-5.htm" title="But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.">2Corinthians 2:5</a>, all but disclaimed the character of being an aggrieved person. He confines himself, therefore, to saying: "So far as I was aggrieved, I have forgiven; so far as I have forgiven, it is for your sake as a body, not merely for my own and that of the offender."<p><span class= "bld">In the person of Christ.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in the face of Christ</span> (See Note on <a href="/2_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed on us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.">2Corinthians 1:11</a>.) <span class= "ital">In the presence of Christ</span> is, therefore, a possible rendering. The English version is probably correct, the phrase conveying the same sense as "in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,">1Corinthians 5:4</a>, but in a somewhat stronger form. He had forgiven, as though Christ was acting in or by him. The forgiveness would be as authoritative as the censure. It will be noted that he claims in its fulness the authority given to the Apostles of Christ in <a href="/john/20-23.htm" title="Whose soever sins you remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins you retain, they are retained.">John 20:23</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To whom ye forgive any thing.</span> In the original there is a conjunction, "but." It would, perhaps, be pressing it too much to imply that their "forgiveness" showed that they had not accurately stood the test of perfect obedience; yet it is difficult to read the whole passage without suspecting that St. Paul, while by temperament he leaned to the side of mercy, is here showing a spirit of generous self-suppression m accepting the course which the Corinthians had followed, although it had, in some way or other, diverged from his exact directions. <span class="accented">To whom</span>, Obviously, again, a purposely indefinite reference to the incestuous person. <span class="cmt_word">I forgive also.</span> The power of "binding" and "loosing," of "forgiving" and "retaining," had only been given to the apostles representatively and collectively, and therefore to the Christian Church (<a href="/john/20-23.htm">John 20:23</a>) in its corporate capacity. The Corinthian Church had in this case decided to forgive, and St. Paul ratifies their decision. <span class="cmt_word">For if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it.</span> The reading here varies between <span class="greek">&#x1f45;</span>, <span class="accented">what</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;</span>, to whom, which in dictation might be easily confused. The order of the words also varies. The best reading seems to be expressed by the version, "For what I also have pardoned, if I have pardoned anything (I have pardoned it) for your sakes." This represents the reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, F, G, etc., and is followed by the Revised Version. There seems to be here an intentional vagueness, and reference to circumstances of which we are not informed, which might, perhaps, have given room for wounded feelings in any one less magnanimous than St. Paul. The line he took in this matter was taken for their sakes - that is all he says, he adopted it as the best <span class="accented">relatively</span>, whether it was <span class="accented">absolutely</span> the best or not. <span class="cmt_word">In the person of Christ;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the face of Christ</span>; which seems to mean "in the presence of Christ," as though he were looking on at what I did (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-11.htm">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7, 13, 18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>).
