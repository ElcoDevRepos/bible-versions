The phrase highlights the communal aspect of prayer, where believers support one another spiritually. In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, a city known for its diverse population and significant trade routes, which made it a hub for various cultural and religious influences. The early Christians in Corinth faced numerous challenges, including persecution and internal divisions. By asking for their prayers, Paul acknowledges the power of collective prayer in overcoming these challenges. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the body of Christ working together, as seen in passages like <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>, which underscores the effectiveness of righteous prayer.<p><b>Then many will give thanks on our behalf</b><br>Paul anticipates that the prayers of the Corinthians will lead to deliverance and blessings, resulting in widespread thanksgiving. This reflects a common biblical pattern where God's intervention leads to communal praise, as seen in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/107-8.htm">Psalm 107:8</a>). The phrase suggests a cycle of prayer, divine intervention, and thanksgiving, which strengthens the faith of the community. Historically, thanksgiving was a significant aspect of Jewish and early Christian worship, often expressed through psalms and hymns during gatherings.<p><b>for the favor shown us in answer to their prayers</b><br>The "favor" mentioned here refers to God's grace and deliverance, which Paul attributes to the prayers of the Corinthians. This highlights the belief in divine providence and the efficacy of prayer in bringing about God's will. The concept of favor or grace is central to Paul's theology, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where salvation is described as a gift of grace. In the cultural context of the time, favor was often associated with patronage systems, where benefactors provided for their clients. Paul redefines this concept spiritually, portraying God as the ultimate benefactor who responds to the prayers of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians, seeking their prayers for his ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthians.htm">Corinthians</a></b><br>- The recipients of the letter, members of the church in Corinth, who are encouraged to participate in Paul's ministry through prayer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>- The act of communicating with God, which Paul emphasizes as a means of support and thanksgiving.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/thanksgiving.htm">Thanksgiving</a></b><br>- The response of gratitude that Paul anticipates from many as a result of answered prayers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/favor.htm">Favor</a></b><br>- The grace or blessing that Paul expects to receive as a result of the prayers of the Corinthians.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_intercessory_prayer.htm">The Power of Intercessory Prayer</a></b><br>Paul underscores the importance of intercessory prayer, showing that it is a vital part of the Christian community's support system.

When prayers are answered, it leads to a collective expression of gratitude, strengthening the bonds within the Christian community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god's_favor.htm">Dependence on God's Favor</a></b><br>Paul acknowledges that any success or favor in his ministry is due to God's grace, accessed through the prayers of the saints. This teaches believers to rely on God's favor rather than their own efforts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_trials.htm">Encouragement in Trials</a></b><br>By asking for prayer, Paul demonstrates humility and the need for support during trials. Believers are reminded that it is okay to seek help and that prayer is a powerful tool in overcoming difficulties.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_gratitude.htm">The Role of Gratitude</a></b><br>Gratitude is a natural response to answered prayers.

It is interesting to note, however, as a fact in the history of language, that, if this be its meaning here, it is probably one of the earliest extant instances of its being so used.<p>The "gift," in this instance, is the deliverance from danger and suffering spoken of in the previous verse. Safety and health deserved the name not less truly than prophecy and the gift of tongues. He assumes, with the same subtle refinement as before, that they will be as ready to give thanks for his recovery or deliverance as they were to pray for it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye also helping together by prayer for us.</span> St. Paul had a deep conviction of the efficacy of intercessory prayer (<a href="/romans/15-30.htm">Romans 15:30, 31</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-19.htm">Philippians 1:19</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-22.htm">Philemon 1:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By the means of many persons;</span> literally, <span class="accented">from many faces</span>.
