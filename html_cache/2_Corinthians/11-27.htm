This phrase reflects the apostolic work ethic, reminiscent of the labor of love mentioned in <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>. The Greek words used here emphasize strenuous effort, suggesting that Paul's ministry was not just spiritual but also involved significant physical hardship. This mirrors the life of Jesus, who also labored tirelessly in His ministry (<a href="/mark/6-31.htm">Mark 6:31</a>).<p><b>and often without sleep</b><br>Paul's mention of sleeplessness underscores the relentless nature of his mission work. This could be due to travel, persecution, or the demands of caring for the churches. It reflects the urgency and importance of spreading the Gospel, similar to Jesus' own sleepless nights in prayer (<a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12</a>). The cultural context of the time involved long journeys and the need for vigilance against threats, both physical and spiritual.<p><b>in hunger and thirst</b><br>Experiencing hunger and thirst was a common hardship for Paul, indicating the lack of basic necessities during his travels. This aligns with the experiences of many prophets and servants of God who faced deprivation (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>). It also connects to Jesus' own fasting and thirst on the cross (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>, <a href="/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28</a>), showing a shared suffering for the sake of God's mission.<p><b>and often without food</b><br>The repetition of being "without food" emphasizes the severity and frequency of Paul's deprivation. This phrase suggests not just temporary fasting but prolonged periods of scarcity, reflecting the sacrifices made for the Gospel. It echoes the trials faced by the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a>) and highlights the reliance on God's provision.<p><b>in cold and exposure</b><br>Paul's mention of "cold and exposure" indicates the harsh environmental conditions he faced, likely during his travels across regions with varying climates. This phrase suggests vulnerability and the lack of adequate shelter, reminiscent of Jesus' statement about having no place to lay His head (<a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>). It also reflects the broader theme of suffering for Christ, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37-38</a>, where the faithful endured similar hardships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth, sharing his experiences and hardships as an apostle of Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality, where Paul established a church and to whom he is addressing this letter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul's_missionary_journeys.htm">Paul's Missionary Journeys</a></b><br>The context of this verse is Paul's recounting of his sufferings during his missionary work to spread the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_in_faith.htm">Endurance in Faith</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s experiences teach us the importance of enduring hardships for the sake of the Gospel.

Far from complaining, Paul cataloged these trials to magnify Christ&#8217;s sustaining power and to remind believers that faithful service may cost earthly comforts yet yields eternal reward (<a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">In weariness and painfullness . . .</span>--The same combination meets us in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but worked with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:">2Thessalonians 3:8</a>, where the English version has "labour and travail," as Tyndale and Cranmer have in this passage. "Weariness and painfulness" appear first in the Geneva version; <span class= "ital">toil and trouble</span> is, perhaps, the best English equivalent. From the use of the phrase in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but worked with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:">2Thessalonians 3:8</a>, it probably refers chiefly to St. Paul's daily labour as a tent-maker. The "watchings" indicate the sleepless nights spent in anxiety, or pain, or prayer. "Hunger and thirst" are named as privations incident to his journeys or his labours. "Fastings," as distinguished from these, can hardly mean anything but times of self-chosen abstinence, of which we have at least two instances in <a href="/context/acts/13-2.htm" title="As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.">Acts 13:2-3</a>, and which would be natural in St. Paul both as a Pharisee (see Notes on <a href="/matthew/6-16.htm" title="Moreover when you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to fast. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:16</a>, and <a href="/luke/18-12.htm" title="I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.">Luke 18:12</a>) and as a disciple of Christ (see Note on <a href="/matthew/9-15.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridal chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.">Matthew 9:15</a>). "Cold and nakedness" seem to speak not only of lonely journeys, thinly clad and thinly shod, on the high passes from Syria into Asia Minor, but also of lodgings without fire, and of threadbare garments. The whole passage reminds us of the narrative given by an old chronicler of the first appearance of the disciples of Francis of Assisi in England, walking with naked and bleeding feet through ice and snow, clothed only with their one friar's cloak, shivering and frost-bitten (Eccleston, <span class= "ital">De Adventu Minorum</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> He obviously contrasts this picture of his sufferings with what the Corinthians knew of the life of his rivals, who, if they were like their brethren of Judaea, walked in long robes, and loved the uppermost places at feasts (<a href="/matthew/23-6.htm" title="And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,">Matthew 23:6</a>).
