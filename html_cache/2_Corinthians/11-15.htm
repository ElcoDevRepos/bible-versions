The phrase suggests that the behavior of these false apostles is expected, given their alignment with Satan.

This deception is a recurring theme in Scripture, where false prophets and teachers appear righteous but lead people astray (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>). The term "masquerade" implies intentional deceit, echoing the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. The cultural context of Corinth, a city known for its diverse religious practices, would have made the church susceptible to such deceit.<p><b>Their end will correspond to their actions.</b><br>This phrase underscores the biblical principle of divine justice, where individuals are ultimately accountable for their deeds (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>). The "end" refers to the final judgment, a consistent theme throughout Scripture, where the righteous and the wicked receive their due (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12-15</a>).

They represented themselves as the preachers of a righteousness which was, they asserted, neglected in St. Paul's teaching. They claimed the authority of one who was known as James the Just, or Righteous, and who had insisted emphatically on the necessity of a righteousness showing itself in act. They presented themselves as a kind of revival of the Chasidim, or righteous ones.

The abruptness with which the next verse opens indicates that here again there was a pause in the dictation of the letter. After an interval--during which, led by the last words he had spoken, his thoughts had travelled to the contrast between their works, of which they boasted so loudly, and his own--he begins again, half-indignant at the necessity for self-assertion which they have forced upon him, aware that all that had been said of his "insane" habit of "commending himself" was likely to be said again, and yet feeling that he must once for all remind the Corinthians of what he had done and suffered, and then leave them to judge between the rival claims.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whose end shall be according to their works.</span> Whatever their fashion (<span class="accented">schema</span>), they shall be judged, not by what they <span class="accented">seem</span>, but by what they <span class="accented">are</span>, as shown by their <span class="accented">works</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/11-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[It is] not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;</span> <span class="translit">(ou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
