These detractors are likely false apostles or individuals influenced by them, questioning Paul's authority and effectiveness. This reflects the broader context of 2 Corinthians, where Paul defends his apostolic authority and the authenticity of his ministry.<p><b>&#8220;His letters are weighty and forceful</b><br>Paul's letters, such as 1 Corinthians, are known for their strong theological arguments and authoritative tone. This reflects his deep understanding of the Gospel and his role as an apostle. The term "weighty" suggests that his writings carry significant spiritual and doctrinal authority, aligning with the power of the Holy Spirit working through him. This echoes the authority seen in other apostolic writings, such as Peter's letters.<p><b>but his physical presence is unimpressive</b><br>Paul's critics argue that his physical appearance does not match the authority of his letters. This may refer to his stature or demeanor, which some found lacking in charisma or presence. In the Greco-Roman world, public speakers were often judged by their appearance and oratory skills. This criticism highlights the cultural values of the time, contrasting with the biblical principle that God often chooses the humble and weak to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>.<p><b>and his speaking is of no account.&#8221;</b><br>This critique suggests that Paul's oratory skills were not as polished or persuasive as those of other speakers. In Corinth, a city known for its love of rhetoric and philosophy, eloquence was highly valued. However, Paul emphasizes in <a href="/1_corinthians/2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</a> that his preaching relied not on human wisdom but on the power of the Spirit.

The verse reminds us to value Spirit-charged truth over surface impressions, recognizing that what seems weak in human eyes often carries the weight and force of divine purpose.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful.</span>--Allusive references to what had been said of him at Corinth have already appeared frequently. Here, for the first time, we have the very words quoted. The scorn conveyed in them had wounded the Apostle's sensitive nature like a poisoned arrow; and we have here the nearest approach which the New Testament presents to the passionate complaints poured forth by some of the Psalmists of the Old (Psalms 69, 109). We note the common element of a burning indignation under the sense of wrong. We note also the absence from the Apostle's feelings of the maledictory element which is so prominent in theirs. The "meekness and gentleness of Christ" had not been without their effect in tempering even the most vehement emotions.<p>The great majority of MSS. give the verb in the singular: "For his letters, <span class= "ital">saith he . . .</span>" This may be taken, like the French <span class= "ital">on dit,</span> as used impersonally, and possibly this is the meaning which the English version was intended to convey. The context, however, the definite "such a man as that" of the next verse, is obviously decisive. St. Paul has in his thoughts here, and through the rest of the chapter, one conspicuous antagonist,--the head of a clique and cabal of opponents.<p><span class= "bld">His bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</span>--As with other antithetical epigrams, the sting was found in the tail. It would seem all but incredible that any doubt could ever have been expressed as to the fact that the words point to physical infirmities. They can, indeed, refer to nothing else. For the tradition as to the Apostle's personal appearance, see <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> at the end of the Acts of the Apostles. The "contemptible speech" (literally, <span class= "ital">speech of no value; counted as nought</span>) may refer either to a weak or unmusical voice, or to the absence of the rhetorical artifices, the exordium, divisions, perorations, in which Greek audiences delighted. It may be noted that these words give a fresh significance to a remarkable passage in an Epistle written, in the judgment of many critics, within a few weeks of this. "You," he says to the Galatians (<a href="/context/galatians/4-13.htm" title="You know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first.">Galatians 4:13-14</a>), "though I came to you with that infirmity of the flesh which others sneer at, the chronic trial of my life, you did not contemn" (the self-same verb as that used here) "nor loathe me." There is manifestly a contrast present to his thoughts between the mean insults of his rivals at Corinth and the affection which the Galatians had once manifested, and which made their subsequent alienation all the more painful to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say they;</span> literally, <span class="accented">says he</span>. The phrase may, indeed, imply "it is said" (<span class="accented">on dit</span>); but it may refer to one main critic and opponent (comp. vers. 7, 11). Perhaps it would have been wiser and kinder if no one had reported to St. Paul all these subterranean calumnies and innuendoes. <span class="cmt_word">Weighty and strong.</span> This could not be denied, considering the immense effect which had been produced by his first letter (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His bodily presence is weak.</span> This is usually taken to mean that St. Paul's personal appearance was unprepossessing (<a href="/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1</a>). This, indeed, we should infer from many other passages (<a href="/1_corinthians/2.htm">1 Corinthians 2</a>:34; <a href="/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13, 14</a>), and as a natural result of his "stake in the flesh." It is, too, the consistent though late tradition respecting him (see my 'Life of St. Paul,' 2:628).
