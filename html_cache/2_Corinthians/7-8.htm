This reflects the pastoral heart of Paul, who, despite the need for correction, is sensitive to the feelings of the believers. The sorrow mentioned here is a godly sorrow that leads to repentance, as opposed to worldly sorrow that leads to death (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>). This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>, "Faithful are the wounds of a friend."<p><b>I do not regret it</b><br>Paul expresses confidence in the necessity and ultimate benefit of his previous rebuke. This mirrors the biblical theme of discipline being an act of love, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>, where discipline is described as painful at the time but yielding a harvest of righteousness. Paul's lack of regret underscores his commitment to truth and the spiritual well-being of the church, even when it involves difficult conversations.<p><b>Although I did regret it</b><br>Here, Paul reveals his initial emotional struggle, showing his humanity and deep care for the Corinthians. This moment of regret highlights the tension between his role as an apostle and his personal affection for the church. It reflects the complexity of leadership and the burden of delivering hard truths, akin to the prophet Nathan confronting King David in <a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12</a>.<p><b>for I see that my letter caused you sorrow</b><br>Paul acknowledges the immediate impact of his letter, which was to bring about sorrow. This sorrow is not an end in itself but a means to an end&#8212;repentance and restoration. The sorrow caused by Paul's letter is a catalyst for change, similar to the conviction brought by the Holy Spirit as described in <a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>.<p><b>but only for a short time</b><br>Paul reassures the Corinthians that their sorrow was temporary and served a greater purpose. This temporary sorrow is contrasted with the eternal joy and peace that come from reconciliation with God. It reflects the biblical principle that trials and discipline are temporary and lead to growth, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>, where trials refine faith like gold.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians.

He owns, however, that there had been a moment, either on first hearing of their grief or in his previous anxiety, when he had half regretted that he had written so strongly. Now he sees that that grief was but transient, and he trusts that the good wrought by it will be abiding.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With a letter;</span> rather, <span class="accented">with my Epistle</span>. Probably the First Epistle, though some suppose that the allusion is to a lost intermediate letter. <span class="cmt_word">I do not repent, though I did repent;</span> better, <span class="accented">I do not regret it</span>. Every one has experienced the anxiety which has followed the despatch of some painful letter. If it does good, well; but perhaps it <span class="accented">may</span> do harm. The severity was called for; it seemed a duty to write severely. But how will the rebuke be received? Might we not have done better if we had used language less uncompromisingly stern? As St. Paul thought with intense anxiety that perhaps in his zeal for truth he may have irrevocably alienated the feelings of the Corinthians, whom, with all their grave faults, he loved, a moment came when he actually regretted what he had written. He himself assures us that he had this feeling. Those who try all kinds of fantastic hypotheses and tortuous exegesis to explain away this phrase as though it were inconsistent with St. Paul's inspiration, go to Scripture to find there their own <span class="accented">a priori</span> dogmas, not to seek what Scripture really says. The doctrine of inspiration is not the fetish into which it has been degraded by formal systems of scholastic theology. Inspiration was not a mechanical dictation of words, but the influence of the Holy Ghost in the hearts of men who retained all their own natural emotions. <span class="cmt_word">For I perceive,</span> etc. There are various ways of taking this clause. Nothing, however, is simpler than to regard it as a parenthetic remark (for I see that that Epistle, though it were but for a time, saddened you). <span class="cmt_word">Though it were but for a season.</span> (For the phrase, see <a href="/philemon/1-15.htm">Philemon 1:15</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-5.htm">Galatians 2:5</a>.) He means to say that their grief will at any rate cease when they receive this letter, and he can bear the thought of having pained them when he remembers the brevity of their grief and the good effects which resulted from it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Even</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
