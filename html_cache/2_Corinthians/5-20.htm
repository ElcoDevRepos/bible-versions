Paul uses this imagery to describe the role of Christians, emphasizing their duty to represent Christ's kingdom on earth. This aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where believers are tasked with spreading the gospel. The term "ambassador" implies authority and responsibility, suggesting that Christians are entrusted with the message of reconciliation and are to live in a way that reflects Christ's character.<p><b>as though God were making His appeal through us</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine partnership in the ministry of reconciliation. God uses believers as instruments to communicate His message of salvation. This concept is rooted in the idea that God works through human agency, as seen throughout Scripture, such as in the prophets of the Old Testament (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). It underscores the seriousness and sacredness of the task, as believers are not merely sharing their own message but are conduits for God's appeal to humanity.<p><b>We implore you on behalf of Christ</b><br>The word "implore" conveys a sense of urgency and earnestness. Paul is not merely suggesting or advising; he is pleading with the Corinthians to respond to the gospel. This reflects the heart of Christ, who desires all to come to repentance (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). Acting "on behalf of Christ" indicates that Paul and his companions are acting as Christ's representatives, emphasizing the authority and importance of their message.<p><b>Be reconciled to God</b><br>Reconciliation is a central theme in Paul's writings, referring to the restoration of the broken relationship between humanity and God due to sin. This echoes the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where atonement was made for sin, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>). The call to "be reconciled" is an invitation to accept the work of Christ on the cross, which has made peace with God possible (<a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>). It is both a command and an offer of grace, urging individuals to accept the salvation freely given through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, writing to the church in Corinth.

The preachers of the Word were acting <span class= "ital">on behalf of</span> Christ; they were acting also <span class= "ital">in His stead.</span> The thought or word meets us again in <a href="/ephesians/6-20.htm" title="For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.">Ephesians 6:20</a>. "I am an ambassador in bonds." The earlier versions (Tyndale, Geneva, Cranmer) give "messengers," the Rhemish "legates." "Ambassadors," which may be noted as singularly felicitous, first appears in the version of 1611. The word, derived from the mediaeval Latin <span class= "ital">ambasciator,</span> and first becoming popular in the Romance languages, is found in Shakespeare, and appears to have come into prominence through the intercourse with France and Spain in the reign of Elizabeth.<p><span class= "bld">We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</span>--It will be seen, in this conclusion of the language of St. Paul as to the atonement, how entirely, on the one hand, he recognises the representative and vicarious character of the redeeming work of Christ; how entirely, on the other, he stands aloof from the speculative theories on that work which have sometimes been built upon his teaching. He does not present, as the system-builders of theology have too often done, the picture of the wrath of the Father averted by the compassion of the Son, or satisfied by the infliction upon Him of a penalty which is a quantitative equivalent for that due to the sins of mankind. The whole work, from his point of view, originates in the love of the Father, sending His Son to manifest that love in its highest and noblest form. He does not need to be reconciled to man. He sends His Son, and His Son sends His ministers to entreat them to be reconciled to Him, to accept the pardon which is freely offered. In the background there lies the thought that the death of Christ was in some way, as the highest act of Divine love, connected with the work of reconciliation; but the mode in which it was effective, is, as Butler says (<span class= "ital">Analogy,</span> 2:5), "mysterious, and left, in part at least, unrevealed," and it is not wise to "endeavour to explain the efficacy of what Christ has done and suffered for us beyond what the Scripture has authorised."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now then.</span> It is, then, on Christ's behalf that we are ambassadors.
