In the Greco-Roman world, boasting was often seen as a way to establish one's credentials and authority. Paul uses this cultural understanding to emphasize his apostolic authority, which is not self-derived but given by God. This approach is consistent with his other writings, such as in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-16.htm">2 Corinthians 11:16-18</a>, where he defends his credentials against false apostles.<p><b>about the authority the Lord gave us</b><br>Paul's authority is divinely appointed, not self-assumed. This authority is rooted in his calling as an apostle, as seen in <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>, where God declares Paul a chosen instrument. The authority is for the purpose of ministry and is a reflection of Christ's own authority, as seen in <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>, where Jesus commissions His disciples. This divine authority is a key theme in Paul's letters, underscoring his role in establishing and guiding the early church.<p><b>for building you up rather than tearing you down</b><br>Paul's mission is constructive, aimed at edifying the church. This reflects the biblical principle of edification found in <a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12</a>, where the purpose of church leadership is to equip and build up the body of Christ. The contrast between building up and tearing down highlights the pastoral nature of Paul's ministry, which seeks the spiritual growth and maturity of believers. This aligns with the Old Testament imagery of God as a builder, as seen in <a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>.<p><b>I will not be ashamed</b><br>Paul expresses confidence in his ministry and its divine mandate. This assurance is rooted in his understanding of the gospel's power, as stated in <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, where he declares he is not ashamed of the gospel. Paul's lack of shame is also a reflection of his commitment to truth and integrity, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12</a>, where he speaks of his trust in God despite suffering. This confidence is a testament to his faith and the legitimacy of his apostolic mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.
