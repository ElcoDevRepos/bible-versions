This reflects the early church's practice of sending emissaries to maintain unity and accountability. The use of "brothers" emphasizes the familial bond within the Christian community, a theme prevalent in Paul's letters.<p><b>in order that our boasting about you in this matter</b><br>Paul had previously expressed confidence in the Corinthians' willingness to contribute generously. This "boasting" is not prideful but rather a testament to their faith and commitment. It highlights the importance of reputation and testimony within the early church, as seen in other passages where Paul speaks of boasting in the Lord (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>).<p><b>should not prove empty</b><br>Paul's concern is that his confidence in the Corinthians might be unfounded if they fail to follow through. This reflects the biblical principle that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>). The integrity of the church's witness is at stake, emphasizing the need for actions to align with professed beliefs.<p><b>but that you will be prepared</b><br>Preparation here involves both spiritual readiness and practical arrangements for the collection. This echoes Jesus' teachings on being prepared for His return (<a href="/matthew/24-44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>) and the parable of the wise and foolish virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>). It underscores the importance of readiness in the Christian life.<p><b>just as I said</b><br>Paul's previous instructions and assurances to other churches about the Corinthians' generosity are at play. This phrase indicates consistency and reliability in Paul's communication, reinforcing the trust between him and the Corinthian church. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of keeping one's word, a value deeply rooted in biblical teaching (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places
