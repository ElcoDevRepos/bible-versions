His "confident boasting" is a rhetorical strategy to highlight the absurdity of boasting in human achievements. In the Greco-Roman world, boasting was common among philosophers and leaders to establish credibility. Paul contrasts this with the Christian virtue of humility, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>, where boasting is only appropriate in understanding and knowing God.<p><b>I am not speaking as the Lord would</b><br>Paul acknowledges that his approach is not in line with Christ's teachings, which emphasize humility and servanthood (<a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>). This phrase underscores the tension between worldly wisdom and divine wisdom, a recurring theme in Paul's letters (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18-25</a>). By admitting this, Paul distances his method from the divine example, emphasizing that his boasting is a necessary, albeit uncomfortable, tactic to counteract the influence of false teachers.<p><b>but as a fool</b><br>Paul uses irony to call attention to the foolishness of boasting. In <a href="/1_corinthians/4-10.htm">1 Corinthians 4:10</a>, he refers to himself as a "fool for Christ," highlighting the paradox of the Christian life, where true wisdom often appears foolish to the world. This self-deprecating term serves to undermine the false apostles who boast in their credentials and achievements. Paul&#8217;s use of "fool" aligns with the biblical theme that God uses the foolish things of the world to shame the wise (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth.

His &#8220;confident boasting&#8221; is a deliberate, ironic response to false apostles who flaunt credentials (see <a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently warns against self-praise (<a href="/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a>); yet Paul engages in it here to unmask prideful opponents and protect the Corinthian church.<p>&#8226; He echoes <a href="/2_corinthians/10-17.htm">2 Corinthians 10:17</a>&#8212;&#8220;Let him who boasts boast in the Lord&#8221;&#8212;showing that any human boasting he allows himself is only a tactical move, never his normal practice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am not speaking as the Lord would</b><p>&#8226; Jesus never drew attention to His own accomplishments for personal acclaim; He said, &#8220;I do not seek My own glory&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-50.htm">John 8:50</a>). Paul acknowledges that his present tone departs from that Christlike pattern.<p>&#8226; By contrasting his words with &#8220;the Lord,&#8221; Paul safeguards the Corinthians from thinking that sanctified bragging is an acceptable lifestyle. The standard remains humility, as <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a> calls believers to &#8220;the mindset of Christ.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This sentence underscores Paul&#8217;s submission to divine authority even while he momentarily steps outside the preferred mode of speech to defend the gospel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But as a fool</b><p>&#8226; In biblical vocabulary, a &#8220;fool&#8221; trusts self rather than God (<a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>). Paul adopts that label sarcastically: if the Corinthians are impressed by worldly boasting, he will play the &#8220;fool&#8221; to expose folly.<p>&#8226; Earlier he asked, &#8220;Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you?&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-19.htm">2 Corinthians 12:19</a>). By calling his approach foolish, he positions the Corinthians to evaluate boasting through a heavenly lens rather than earthly admiration (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<p>&#8226; This self-deprecating disclaimer ensures that any accolades landing on Paul are redirected to Christ, aligning with <a href="/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a>&#8212;&#8220;May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s words in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-17.htm">2 Corinthians 11:17</a> are a calculated, ironic tactic. He momentarily adopts &#8220;confident boasting&#8221; to meet the Corinthian fascination with flashy credentials, yet immediately reminds them that such speech is unlike the Lord&#8217;s humble example and fits the profile of a &#8220;fool.&#8221; By doing so, he exposes the emptiness of worldly pride, safeguards the church from deception, and ultimately points all glory back to Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in foolishness;</span> as keeping up the emphatic repetition of the same word in the English as in the Greek. From one point of view the distinction drawn is the same as that which we find in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.">1Corinthians 7:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1Corinthians 7:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12</a>. There is, however, a marked difference in the subject-matter of the two cases. There he distinguishes a private opinion from a principle or rule which he feels to be divine. Here he draws the line of demarcation between human feelings and a divine inspiration. It is, of course, easy to raise questions which would be hard, if they were not also frivolous and foolish. Are we to class what he places on the lower side of the boundary-line as inspired or uninspired teaching? If the former, are we not contradicting what he writes as inspired? If the latter, are we not depriving what follows of the authority of an inspired writing? Are we not, in so doing, admitting the principle of recognising a human element mingling with the divine in other parts of Scripture as well as this? The answer to these questions, so far as they need an answer, is best found in taking St. Paul's words in their plain and natural sense, believing that his words have just the authority which he claims for them, and no more. Speaking apart from these questions, there is something almost pathetic in the consciousness which he feels that self-vindication can never, as such, come from the Spirit of God, and that it is, at the best, a pardonable human weakness. It is not wrong, or else his conscience would have forbidden it. It is not the note of the highest or noblest temper, or else he would have felt the Spirit's guidance in it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not after the Lord.</span> "Boasting," or what might be stigmatized as such, may become a sort of painful necessity, necessitated by human baseness; but in itself it cannot be "after the Lord."
