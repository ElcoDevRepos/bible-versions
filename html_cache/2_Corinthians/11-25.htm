This punishment was typically reserved for non-citizens, but Paul, a Roman citizen, endured it multiple times, highlighting his willingness to suffer for the Gospel. The Acts of the Apostles (<a href="/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22-23</a>) records an instance in Philippi where Paul and Silas were beaten with rods, illustrating the physical persecution faced by early Christians. This suffering aligns with Jesus' teachings on persecution (<a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>) and reflects the apostolic commitment to spreading the Gospel despite severe opposition.<p><b>once I was stoned</b><br>Stoning was a Jewish form of capital punishment for blasphemy and other serious offenses. Paul&#8217;s stoning, recorded in <a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>, occurred in Lystra, where he was dragged out of the city and left for dead. This event underscores the intense hostility Paul faced from both Jews and Gentiles. Stoning was intended to be lethal, yet Paul survived, demonstrating God's protection and purpose for his ministry. This experience parallels the suffering of Christ, who was rejected and condemned by His own people (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>), and it fulfills Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face persecution (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<p><b>three times I was shipwrecked</b><br>Paul's mention of being shipwrecked three times is significant, as only one shipwreck is detailed in the New Testament (Acts 27). This indicates that Paul experienced other shipwrecks not recorded in Scripture, emphasizing the dangers of ancient sea travel and the Apostle's relentless missionary journeys. The Mediterranean Sea was notorious for its unpredictable weather and perilous conditions, making travel hazardous. Paul's perseverance through such trials reflects his dedication to spreading the Gospel and his reliance on God's providence, reminiscent of Jonah's journey and deliverance (Jonah 1-2).<p><b>I spent a night and a day in the open sea</b><br>This phrase highlights the severity of Paul's shipwreck experiences, as surviving in the open sea for an extended period was perilous. The Apostle's endurance through such life-threatening situations underscores his unwavering faith and commitment to his mission. This ordeal can be seen as a testament to God's sustaining power, similar to how God preserved Jonah in the belly of the great fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>). Paul's survival serves as a metaphor for spiritual perseverance, echoing the promise of God's presence and deliverance in times of trial (<a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is recounting his sufferings for the sake of the Gospel.

The other two are unrecorded, showing how common such abuse became for him.<p>&#8226; Rods were the Roman magistrates&#8217; approved tool (<a href="/acts/16-35.htm">Acts 16:35-37</a>), so Paul&#8212;though a Roman citizen&#8212;accepted injustice for the gospel&#8217;s advance, echoing Jesus&#8217; call to &#8220;take up your cross&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>).<p>&#8226; His endurance fulfills the Lord&#8217;s word at Paul&#8217;s conversion: &#8220;I will show him how much he must suffer for My name&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-16.htm">Acts 9:16</a>).<p>&#8226; For modern believers the episode underlines <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>: &#8220;Indeed, all who desire to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.&#8221; Physical safety is never the primary evidence of God&#8217;s favor; faithfulness is.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>once I was stoned</b><p>Paul adds, &#8220;once I was stoned.&#8221; <a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19-20</a> records it: enemies from Antioch and Iconium &#8220;won over the crowds.

Jesus had promised, &#8220;If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>), and Paul counted it a privilege to share in Christ&#8217;s sufferings (<a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>three times I was shipwrecked</b><p>Seafaring was unavoidable in Paul&#8217;s calling; so were its dangers.<p>&#8226; Luke later chronicles a dramatic wreck on Malta (<a href="/bsb/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>), but that occurred after 2 Corinthians was written&#8212;meaning Paul already had three other losses at sea.

Instead, hardship showcased divine strength: &#8220;We have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this surpassingly great power is from God&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I spent a night and a day in the open sea</b><p>After one of those wrecks, Paul &#8220;spent a night and a day in the open sea.&#8221;<p>&#8226; He was adrift&#8212;likely clinging to debris&#8212;about thirty-six hours, an ordeal few survived. Yet God preserved him much as He did Jonah (<a href="/bsb/jonah/2.htm">Jonah 2</a>) and those in <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>: &#8220;When you pass through the waters, I will be with you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The detail underscores that Paul&#8217;s list is literal, not hyperbole.

And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.">Acts 11:26</a>), or to voyages among the islands of the 'gean Sea during his stay at Corinth or at Ephesus, or to that from Ephesus to Caesarea in <a href="/acts/18-22.htm" title="And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.">Acts 18:22</a>.<p><span class= "bld">A night and a day I have been in the deep.</span>--Taken in their natural sense the words probably point to one of the shipwrecks just mentioned, in which, either swimming or with the help of a plank (as in <a href="/acts/27-44.htm" title="And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.">Acts 27:44</a>), he had kept himself floating for nearly a whole day, beginning with the night. They have, however, been referred by some writers to a dungeon pit, like that into which Jeremiah was cast (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm" title="Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.">Jeremiah 38:6</a>), in which the Apostle was either thrown or hid himself after the stoning at Lystra. Bede (<span class= "ital">Qucest.</span> iii. 8) relates, on the authority of Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury--whose evidence, as a native of Tarsus, has here a special interest--that there was such a dungeon known by the name of <span class= "ital">Bythos</span> (the word used here for "deep") in his time at Cyzicus, and, if so, it is probable enough that the same use of the word may have prevailed in other cities. So at Athens there was a dungeon known as the <span class= "ital">barathron</span>--a word used also for a "gulf." On the whole, however, though the conjecture is interesting enough to deserve mention, there seems no adequate reason for adopting it. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thrice was I beaten with rods.</span> This alludes to scourgings inflicted by Gentile magistrates with the <span class="accented">vitis</span>, or vine stick, of soldiers, or with the fasces of lictors.

In any case they were egregious violations of St. Paul's right of Roman citizenship; but this claim (as we see in Cicero's various orations) was often set at nought in the provinces. <span class="cmt_word">Once was I stoned</span>.
