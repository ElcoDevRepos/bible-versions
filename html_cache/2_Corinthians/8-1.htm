This term reflects the unity and equality within the body of Christ, transcending social and cultural barriers. It echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/23-8.htm">Matthew 23:8</a>, where He calls His followers to view each other as siblings under one Father.<p><b>we want you to know</b><br>Paul's intention is to inform and encourage the Corinthians by sharing a testimony of God's work. This phrase indicates the importance of sharing testimonies within the Christian community to build faith and inspire action, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>, which encourages believers to spur one another on toward love and good deeds.<p><b>about the grace</b><br>The term "grace" here refers to the divine favor and empowerment given by God. It is not merely unmerited favor but also the enabling power for believers to live out their faith. This grace is a central theme in Paul's writings, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where salvation itself is described as a gift of grace.<p><b>that God has given</b><br>This emphasizes that the source of the grace is God Himself, highlighting His sovereignty and generosity. It reflects the biblical principle that every good and perfect gift comes from above (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). It also underscores the idea that any ability to give or serve comes from God's provision.<p><b>the churches of Macedonia</b><br>The churches in Macedonia, including Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea, were known for their generosity despite their poverty (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-2.htm">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>). This region was historically significant, having been a major center of Greek culture and later a Roman province. The Macedonian churches' actions exemplify the principle found in <a href="/luke/21.htm">Luke 21:1-4</a>, where the widow's offering is commended for its sacrificial nature.

Paul shifts from reporting his travel plans (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5-7</a>) to introducing a fresh topic: the collection for the Jerusalem saints. Similar pivots appear in <a href="/acts/13-36.htm">Acts 13:36</a> and <a href="/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>, reminding us that God&#8217;s work is unfolding moment by moment, and every new &#8220;now&#8221; calls the church to fresh obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>brothers</b><p>By addressing them as &#8220;brothers,&#8221; Paul appeals to family bonds in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26-28</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>). The term softens any forthcoming exhortation, showing that generosity flows best within loving, Spirit-created relationships rather than cold obligation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we want you to know</b><p>Paul purposely informs rather than commands. Knowledge fuels conviction (<a href="/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9-10</a>). When believers grasp how God is already at work elsewhere, faith rises and imitation follows (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6-8</a>). Transparency about God&#8217;s deeds becomes a catalyst for further grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>about the grace</b><p>&#8220;Grace&#8221; here refers not only to saving favor but to the God-given ability to give generously (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-7.htm">2 Corinthians 8:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>). Whenever Christians share resources, it is first God&#8217;s grace manifesting through them (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>). This keeps the spotlight on the Lord, preventing pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that God has given</b><p>Paul underscores divine sourcing. The Macedonians&#8217; generosity is not self-generated; it is a gift from God (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). Recognizing God as the giver guards us from both envy and self-reliance and encourages prayer for more grace (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the churches of Macedonia</b><p>These congregations&#8212;Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea (<a href="/bsb/acts/16.htm">Acts 16-17</a>)&#8212;were marked by persecution and poverty (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-2.htm">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>). Yet they abounded in sacrificial giving, echoing the widow&#8217;s mite (<a href="/luke/21-1.htm">Luke 21:1-4</a>). Their example proves that financial limitation never limits God&#8217;s ability to work through willing hearts (<a href="/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1</a> introduces Paul&#8217;s teaching on Christian giving by pointing to real believers who, despite hardship, displayed extraordinary generosity. Every phrase shifts our focus from human ability to God&#8217;s empowering grace, inviting today&#8217;s church family to trust the same Lord, walk in the same grace, and bless others with the resources He supplies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>VIII.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">we declare,</span> or <span class= "ital">make known to you.</span> There is no adequate reason for retaining a phrase which is now obsolete. The topic on which the Epistle now touches, and which is carried on through this and the following chapter, was one very dear to the Apostle's heart. (See Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1</a>.) When he wrote before he had simply given directions as to what the Corinthians were to do. Now he has something to tell them. The churches of Macedonia--Philippi, we must believe, prominent among them--had been true to their old generosity (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-8.htm" title="I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.">2Corinthians 11:8-9</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Philippians 4:15</a>), and were now showing it, not, as before, in personal kindness to their teacher, but in the truer way of acting as he wished them to act; and he sees in this a means of stirring up his friends at Corinth to an honourable emulation. There is something intensely characteristic in the way in which he opens his statement. He traces the generosity of the Macedonians to its true source. He is going to tell the Corinthians of the "grace of God" that has enabled them to do so much.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We do you to wit;</span> rather, <span class="accented">we make known to you</span>. The phrase is like the modern "I wish to inform you." In this and the next chapter St. Paul, having fully spoken of the joy which had been caused to him by their reception of his first letter, and having said as much as he then intended to say in answer to the charges insinuated against him, proceeds to give directions about the collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem. He had already spoken of it (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1-4</a>), but feared that they were behindhand, and now sends Titus to stimulate their zeal. The style throughout is brief and allusive, because he had already, in various ways, brought this matter fully before them. Throughout this section he shows in a remarkable degree the tact, courtesy, high sense of honour, and practical wisdom which were among his many gifts. The "but" with which the chapter begins in the original is St. Paul's ordinary formula of transition, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-1.htm">1 Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>, etc. (For the phrase, "we inform you," see <a href="/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-1.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1</a>.) It is one of numberless incidental proofs of the genuineness of this group of Epistles - the Epistles of the second great missionary journey - that the same words, phrases, and thoughts constantly recur in them. <span class="cmt_word">The grace of God</span> (see next note). <span class="cmt_word">Bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia;</span> rather, <span class="accented">which is being bestowed in the Churches</span>. St. Paul wants to tell the Corinthians how extremely liberal the Macedonians have been, since it was his custom to stir up one Church by the example of another (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>); but he begins by speaking of their generosity as a proof of the grace which they are receiving from the Holy Spirit. <span class="accented">The Churches of Macedonia</span>. The only Macedonian Churches of which we have any details in the New Testament are those of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Beroea. They seem to have been peculiarly dear to St. Paul, who was attracted by their cheerfulness in affliction and their generosity in the midst of want. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">brothers,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(adelphoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_80.htm">Strong's 80: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brother, member of the same religious community, especially a fellow-Christian.
