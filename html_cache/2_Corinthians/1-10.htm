The "deadly peril" likely refers to the severe hardships and life-threatening situations Paul faced, possibly in Ephesus (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8-9</a>). Historically, Ephesus was a center of pagan worship and opposition to the Gospel, which could have contributed to the dangers Paul encountered. This deliverance echoes the broader biblical theme of God rescuing His people, as seen in the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>) and Daniel's deliverance from the lions (<a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>).<p><b>and He will deliver us</b><br>Paul expresses confidence in God's continued protection. This assurance is rooted in the character of God, who is faithful and unchanging (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). The future deliverance can be seen as both physical and spiritual, aligning with the promise of ultimate salvation through Christ (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9-10</a>). This reflects the Christian belief in God's sovereignty and His ability to save His people from all forms of danger.<p><b>In Him we have placed our hope</b><br>Hope in God is a central theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing trust in His promises and faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20-22</a>). This hope is not wishful thinking but a confident expectation based on God's past actions and His nature. The New Testament frequently highlights hope as a key aspect of the Christian life, grounded in the resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a>).<p><b>that He will yet again deliver us</b><br>Paul's statement underscores a continuous reliance on God for deliverance. This reflects the ongoing nature of the Christian journey, where believers face trials but trust in God's provision and protection (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>). The phrase also points to the eschatological hope of final deliverance at Christ's return, when all believers will be saved from sin and death (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>). This future deliverance is a fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, as prophesied throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

has delivered us from such a deadly peril</b><p>Paul looks back on a very real, life-threatening situation&#8212;likely the crushing trials referenced in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8-9</a>.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s past rescue is a fact, not a feeling. Like Daniel pulled from the lions&#8217; den (<a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>) and David saved from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>), Paul states a historical deliverance that showcases God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p>&#8226; The moment we recall God&#8217;s proven track record, fear loosens its grip. &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him from them all&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Deliverance here is both physical and spiritual; God spared Paul&#8217;s life and strengthened his soul (<a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He will deliver us</b><p>Past grace fuels present confidence.<p>&#8226; Because &#8220;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>), the God who stepped in yesterday stands ready now.<p>&#8226; This is not presumption; it is reliance on a faithful covenant-keeping Lord. &#8220;The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, and delivers them&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Ongoing deliverance covers today&#8217;s threats&#8212;temptation, persecution, anxiety.
