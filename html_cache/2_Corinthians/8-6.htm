His role in the early church was significant, as seen in his involvement with the Corinthian church. Paul&#8217;s urging of Titus indicates the importance of the task at hand and the trust Paul placed in him.

This collection was a significant effort among the early churches, demonstrating unity and support across geographical and cultural boundaries.
