In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to a church that has experienced various trials and persecutions. The Greek word for "comfort" here is "parakl&#275;sis," which implies encouragement and consolation. This reflects the nature of God as described in <a href="/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>, where God declares Himself as the one who comforts His people. Historically, the early church faced significant persecution, and this assurance of divine comfort would have been crucial for their endurance. The comfort God provides is not limited to specific situations but encompasses all troubles, indicating His omnipresence and omnipotence.<p><b>so that we can comfort those in any trouble</b><br>This phrase suggests a purpose behind the comfort received from God: to enable believers to extend that same comfort to others. This reflects the communal and interdependent nature of the Christian faith, where believers are called to support one another. The early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, was characterized by a strong sense of community and mutual aid. This principle of comforting others is also seen in the life of Jesus, who often reached out to those in distress, such as in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>, where He invites the weary to find rest in Him. The phrase underscores the idea that personal experiences of God's comfort equip believers to minister to others effectively.<p><b>with the comfort we ourselves have received from God</b><br>This final phrase emphasizes the source and authenticity of the comfort believers are to share. It is not a human-derived consolation but one that originates from God Himself. This divine comfort is transformative and empowering, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like David, who found solace in God during his trials (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>). The cyclical nature of receiving and giving comfort mirrors the concept of grace, where believers are conduits of God's love and mercy. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God using His people to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the lives of the prophets and apostles. The comfort received is a testament to God's faithfulness and serves as a powerful witness to His character and promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth.

He had felt that ever-continuing comfort flowing into his soul, and he knew that it had not been given to him for his own profit only, but that it might flow forth to others. Heathen poets had asserted one side of the truth. Sophocles had said--<p>"They comfort others who themselves have mourned;"<p><span class= "ital">--Fragm.</span><p>and Virgil--<p>"Not ignorant of ill, I, too, have learnt<p>To succour those that suffer."--<span class= "ital">'n.</span> i. 630.<p>There was a yet deeper truth in the thought that the power to comfort varies with the measure in which we have been comforted ourselves. Sorrow alone may lead to sympathy, but it falls short of that power to speak a word in season to them that are weary (<a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm" title="Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they are gone away backward.">Isaiah 1:4</a>), which is of the very essence of the work of comforting. The words imply that he had passed through a time of tribulation himself. They imply also that he knew of their troubles. (Comp. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/7-7.htm" title="And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.">2Corinthians 7:7-11</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who comforteth us.</span> The "us" implies here, not only St. Paul and Timothy, but also the Corinthians, who are one with them in a bond of Christian unity which was hitherto undreamed of, and was a new phenomenon in the world. St. Paul always uses the first person in passages where he is speaking directly of individual feelings and experiences. In other passages he likes to lose himself, as it were, in the Christian community. The delicate play of emotion is often shown by the rapid interchanges of singular and plural (see vers. 13, 15, 17; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-1.htm">2 Corinthians 2:1, 11, 14</a>, etc.). The present, "comforteth," expresses a continuous experience, with which the Christians of the first age were most happily familiar (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-18</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:16, 17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In all our affliction.</span> The collective experience of affliction is sustained by the collective experience of comfort. <span class="cmt_word">That we may be able to comfort.</span> Thus St. Paul takes "a teleological view of sorrow."
