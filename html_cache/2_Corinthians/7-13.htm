This encouragement stems from the Corinthians' repentance and renewed commitment to the teachings Paul had imparted. The phrase highlights the mutual relationship between Paul and the Corinthian church, where their spiritual growth and obedience bring him personal encouragement. This reflects the broader biblical principle that the faithfulness of believers can uplift and strengthen church leaders, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:7-9</a>.<p><b>In addition to our own encouragement, we were even more delighted by the joy of Titus.</b><br>Titus, a trusted companion of Paul, had been sent to Corinth to observe and report back on the church's condition. His joy upon returning indicates that the Corinthians had responded positively, not only to Paul's previous rebukes but also to the gospel message itself. This joy is significant because it underscores the successful reconciliation and unity within the church. The delight of Titus serves as a testament to the transformative power of repentance and forgiveness, echoing the joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, as described in <a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>.<p><b>For his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.</b><br>The Corinthians' actions had a rejuvenating effect on Titus, suggesting that their hospitality, kindness, and spiritual progress were evident. This refreshment of spirit can be seen as a fulfillment of the Christian call to bear one another's burdens and to encourage one another, as mentioned in <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a> and <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>. The phrase also implies a communal aspect of faith, where the actions of a group can significantly impact the well-being and morale of individuals within the community.

The God who &#8220;comforts the downcast&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6</a>) used their repentance to lift his spirits, just as He earlier comforted Elijah by showing him a faithful remnant (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Encouragement flows naturally when believers see fruit from difficult ministry efforts (<a href="/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3&#8211;6</a>; 3 <a href="/bsb/john/4.htm">John 4</a>). Paul&#8217;s comfort here models the principle of <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>&#8212;&#8220;let us not grow weary in well-doing, for in due time we will reap.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In addition to our own encouragement, we were even more delighted by the joy of Titus.</b><p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s comfort multiplies because someone he loves&#8212;Titus&#8212;has returned brimming with joy. Shared joy deepens fellowship (<a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Titus had carried Paul&#8217;s stern letter (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8</a>) and risked being received poorly, yet he came back radiant. Seeing a co-worker rejoice is a &#8220;double encouragement,&#8221; much like Paul&#8217;s thrill when Timothy brought a good report from Thessalonica (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Note the order:<p>&#8211; Paul&#8217;s comfort at the Corinthians&#8217; repentance.<p>&#8211; Added delight at Titus&#8217;s joy.<p>&#8211; This pattern underscores <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>: leaders find &#8220;joy&#8221; when those they serve respond well.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Refreshed&#8221; echoes <a href="/1_corinthians/16-18.htm">1 Corinthians 16:18</a> and <a href="/philemon/1-7.htm">Philemon 1:7</a>, where Paul commends believers who lift others&#8217; hearts. The Corinthians, once a source of grief (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>), have become a channel of refreshment.<p>&#8226; Practical ways they refreshed Titus likely included:<p>&#8211; Warm hospitality and provision (<a href="/acts/28-15.htm">Acts 28:15</a>).<p>&#8211; Eagerness to obey Paul&#8217;s instruction (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>).<p>&#8211; Evident affection for Christ and His servants (<a href="/philippians/2-29.htm">Philippians 2:29</a>).<p>&#8226; When a congregation encourages a visiting worker, they partner in the gospel (<a href="/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>) and mirror the household of Onesiphorus, who &#8220;often refreshed&#8221; Paul (<a href="/2_timothy/1-16.htm">2 Timothy 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s words in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-13.htm">2 Corinthians 7:13</a> reveal a three-fold chain of encouragement: the Corinthians&#8217; repentance comforts Paul, Titus&#8217;s joyful report delights him even more, and the believers&#8217; kindness refreshes Titus himself. The verse showcases how repentance restores relationships, how shared joy strengthens leaders, and how hospitality refreshes weary servants&#8212;reminding us that in Christ every act of obedience and love multiplies comfort throughout the body.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Therefore we were comforted.</span>--The tense of the Greek verb implies a different structure of the sentence: <span class= "ital">Therefore we have been comforted: and upon </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> over and above) <span class= "ital">our comfort we rejoiced more exceedingly at the joy of Titus.</span> That was to St. Paul a new source of happiness.
