However, this phrase emphasizes his humanity, reminding believers that he shared the same nature and limitations as any other person. This is significant because it underscores the accessibility of God's power through prayer to all believers, not just to prophets or those with special callings. Elijah's story is primarily found in <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17-19</a>, where he confronts the idolatry of Israel under King Ahab and Queen Jezebel. His humanity is evident in moments of fear and doubt, such as when he flees from Jezebel (<a href="/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3-4</a>).<p><b>He prayed earnestly that it would not rain,</b><br>Elijah's earnest prayer is a demonstration of his deep faith and reliance on God. The context of this prayer is found in <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>, where Elijah declares to Ahab that there will be no rain except at his word. This prayer was not a personal vendetta but a divine judgment against Israel for their idolatry and turning away from God. The earnestness of his prayer reflects a fervent and sincere heart, aligning with the biblical principle that the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).<p><b>and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years.</b><br>The drought lasted for three and a half years, a period that holds symbolic significance in biblical prophecy and eschatology. This timeframe is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2-3</a>, where it is associated with periods of trial and divine judgment. The drought was a direct challenge to Baal, the Canaanite storm god, demonstrating the supremacy of the God of Israel. This event also prefigures the ministry of Jesus Christ, who, like Elijah, performed miracles and called people to repentance. The drought's end, marked by Elijah's prayer for rain in <a href="/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41-45</a>, signifies God's mercy and the restoration that follows repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament known for his powerful prayers and miracles.

In <a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm" title="And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.">1Kings 17:1</a>, the prophet simply and sternly tells Ahab "there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word." Further on (<a href="/context/1_kings/18-41.htm" title="And Elijah said to Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.">1Kings 18:41-46</a>) "there is a sound of abundance of rain." In our Epistle we read that Elias "prayed earnestly"--literally, <span class= "ital">prayed in his prayer, </span>a Hebraistic form of emphasis (see margin). He asked for drought, and it lasted three years and a half, so that "there was a sore famine in Samaria." He prayed once more, and "the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain," and thus again "the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man." Yet Elijah was no demi-god; we even learn how he shrank from his prophet's yoke, and longed to die. No one therefore may despair in his petitions but rather let his "requests be made known unto God;" for "men ought always to pray, and not to faint" (<a href="/luke/18-1.htm" title="And he spoke a parable to them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;">Luke 18:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">It rained not on the earth.</span>--This Orientalism need not be a snare to the most literal of readers. The punishment, because of Ahab and Jezebel, fell on their own kingdom, and not the whole world. In a similar hyperbole Obadiah told Elijah, concerning this very famine, "there is no nation, or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee" (<a href="/1_kings/18-10.htm" title="As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found you not.">1Kings 18:10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - Illustration of the last statement of ver. 16, from the case of Elijah, "a righteous man" under the old covenant, but one "of like passions with us," and therefore one from whose case it is lawful to argue to our own. <span class="cmt_word">Subject to like passions as we are</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>: simply "of like passions with us;" cf. <a href="/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15</a>, where it is used in just the same way.
