It is often used in Scripture to introduce a significant or urgent message, similar to the prophetic calls in the Old Testament.<p><b>the wages you withheld from the workmen</b><br>Withholding wages was a violation of the Mosaic Law, which commanded prompt payment to laborers (<a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>). This reflects a broader biblical principle of justice and fairness in economic dealings. In the historical context, day laborers were often poor and relied on daily wages for survival, making this sin particularly grievous.<p><b>who mowed your fields</b><br>Agriculture was a central part of the economy in biblical times, and mowing fields was a common task. This phrase highlights the agrarian society in which James's audience lived. The workmen were likely hired to harvest grain, a critical task that ensured the landowner's wealth and sustenance.<p><b>are crying out against you.</b><br>This echoes the language of <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>, where Abel's blood cries out to God from the ground. It suggests that the injustice done to the laborers is not hidden but is known to God, who hears the cries of the oppressed. This also aligns with the biblical theme of God as a defender of the poor and marginalized.<p><b>The cries of the harvesters</b><br>The harvesters represent those who are vulnerable and exploited. Their cries symbolize a plea for divine justice, reminiscent of the Israelites' cries in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-9</a>). This phrase underscores the biblical narrative of God responding to the suffering of His people.<p><b>have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts.</b><br>The title "Lord of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power, often used in contexts of divine judgment and warfare (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>). It assures that God is aware of the injustice and will act as a righteous judge. This phrase connects to the prophetic tradition where God hears and responds to the cries of the oppressed (<a href="/isaiah/5-9.htm">Isaiah 5:9</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally understood to be James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church. He writes with authority and pastoral concern for the moral and spiritual conduct of believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/workmen/harvesters.htm">Workmen/Harvesters</a></b><br>These are the laborers who worked in the fields, representing the oppressed and marginalized in society. They are victims of injustice, having their rightful wages withheld.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The Lord of Hosts</a></b><br>A title for God emphasizing His sovereignty and power. It underscores God's role as a defender of the oppressed and a judge of injustice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fields.htm">Fields</a></b><br>Symbolic of the agricultural society of the time, where landowners had significant power over laborers. The fields represent the setting of economic transactions and potential exploitation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wages.htm">Wages</a></b><br>The payment due to the laborers, which is unjustly withheld.

Believers are called to transparent, timely, and fair dealings, confident that righteousness in everyday transactions honors the Savior and avoids judgment reserved for those who use wealth to oppress rather than serve.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Behold, the hire of the labourers.</span>--Not merely the wrong of the poor, but the wages kept back from him by the stingy master, contrary to the merciful Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm" title="You shall not defraud your neighbor, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with you all night until the morning.">Leviticus 19:13</a>), which permitted no delay in payment whatever (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm" title="Woe to him that builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that uses his neighbor's service without wages, and gives him not for his work;">Jeremiah 22:13</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm" title="And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:5</a>). And the indignant remonstrance of the text is "a swift witness" also against the like-minded of this generation--whose God is self, whose religion political economy, and whose one great object in life is to buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest: as if for these ignoble purposes the Lord God had given them a brain and a soul.<p><span class= "bld">The hire of the labourers . . . kept back by fraud, crieth</span> (<span class= "ital">out</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span>--A question has arisen concerning the right position of the word translated "of," or <span class= "ital">from you, </span>in this clause; whether the withholden dues appeal "<span class= "ital">from</span> the wronger to God," or as the Authorised version has it above, "the hire of the labourers <span class= "ital">of</span> you kept back by fraud."
