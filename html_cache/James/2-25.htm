It implies a continuation of the argument that faith without works is dead, as seen in the previous verses. The phrase suggests that just as Abraham was justified by his works, so too was Rahab, establishing a parallel between the patriarch and a Gentile woman.<p><b>was not even Rahab the prostitute</b><br>Rahab is introduced with her occupation, highlighting her status as a marginalized individual in society. Her story is found in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>, where she is a Canaanite living in Jericho. Despite her background, she is included in the genealogy of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>), demonstrating God's grace and the inclusion of Gentiles in His redemptive plan. Her faith is commended in <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>, showing that her actions were a result of her belief in the God of Israel.<p><b>justified by her actions</b><br>The term "justified" here refers to being shown righteous or vindicated. Rahab's actions in hiding the spies and aiding their escape were evidence of her faith. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that true faith results in action, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures. Her works were a demonstration of her faith, not the means of her salvation.<p><b>when she welcomed the spies</b><br>Rahab's welcoming of the spies is a pivotal moment in the narrative of <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>. Her hospitality and protection of the Israelite spies were acts of faith, acknowledging the power and sovereignty of the God of Israel. This act of welcoming is significant in the cultural context of the ancient Near East, where hospitality was a highly valued virtue.<p><b>and sent them off on another route?</b><br>Rahab's strategic decision to send the spies off on a different route ensured their safety and the success of their mission. This action demonstrated her wisdom and courage, as well as her commitment to the God of Israel. It also fulfilled the spies' promise to spare her and her family, as recounted in <a href="/joshua/6-22.htm">Joshua 6:22-25</a>.

Now he says, &#8220;Here&#8217;s another example built on the same principle.&#8221; The phrase links Rahab&#8217;s story to the ongoing point that genuine faith reveals itself through tangible deeds. Just as a shadow proves the presence of light, works prove the presence of living faith (cf. <a href="/matthew/7-20.htm">Matthew 7:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was not even Rahab the prostitute</b><p>Rahab&#8217;s label reminds us God&#8217;s grace reaches people others overlook.<p>&#8226; She was a Gentile and a prostitute, yet God chose her (<a href="/bsb/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Her inclusion in Jesus&#8217; genealogy (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>) displays how the Lord delights in redeeming unlikely candidates (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p>If Rahab could live out authentic faith, no one is beyond hope.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>justified by her actions</b><p>&#8220;Justified&#8221; here speaks of outward vindication&#8212;proof that her faith was real. James earlier said, &#8220;You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-24.htm">James 2:24</a>). Rahab&#8217;s deeds did not earn salvation; they showcased it. True faith moves the believer to act (<a href="/titus/3-8.htm">Titus 3:8</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>). Abraham believed God and then offered Isaac; Rahab believed God and then protected the spies.

Faith spoke, then acted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sent them off on another route?</b><p>Her faith did not stall at initial kindness; it followed through with courageous strategy.

Rahab, an unlikely heroine, trusted the God of Israel. Her trust showed up in risky hospitality and decisive protection of the spies. Scripture holds her up alongside Abraham to affirm that:<p>&#8226; Faith alone saves, yet the faith that saves never stays alone.<p>&#8226; God delights in using ordinary, even morally compromised people who place wholehearted trust in Him.<p>&#8226; Works are the visible evidence that the invisible root of faith is alive and well.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Likewise also . . .</span>--The second example, brought forward in strange and complete contrast to Abraham, "the father of many nations," is that of Rahab, the harlot, who received and sheltered in her house at Jericho the two spies sent out from the camp of Israel (Joshua 2).

And it is most remarkable, as showing the mercy of God, that this outcast of society was not only saved alive and brought into the fold of Israel, but became a direct ancestress of her Saviour, by marriage with Salmon, the great-great-grandfather of David (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm" title="And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;">Matthew 1:5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="accented">Fourth point</span>: Proof from the case of Rahab the harlot of justification by works (cf. <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>).
