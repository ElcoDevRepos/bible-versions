Slander, or speaking ill of others, is condemned throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/10-18.htm">Proverbs 10:18</a>, <a href="/ephesians/4-31.htm">Ephesians 4:31</a>). The term "brothers" underscores the idea that Christians are part of a spiritual family, called to support and uplift one another, reflecting the love of Christ (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>).<p><b>Anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him</b><br>This part of the verse warns against the dangers of speaking against or judging fellow believers. The act of judging here refers to a critical and condemning attitude, which is contrary to the teachings of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/7.htm">Matthew 7:1-5</a>). The historical context of the early church, which faced internal conflicts and divisions, makes this admonition particularly relevant. It calls for humility and self-examination rather than focusing on the faults of others.<p><b>speaks against the law and judges it.</b><br>The "law" in this context likely refers to the moral law, particularly the command to love one's neighbor as oneself (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, <a href="/james/2-8.htm">James 2:8</a>). By judging others, one places themselves above the law, acting as if they are exempt from its requirements. This reflects a misunderstanding of the law's purpose, which is to guide believers in righteous living and to foster community harmony.<p><b>And if you judge the law, you are not a practitioner of the law, but a judge of it.</b><br>This phrase highlights the inconsistency of claiming to follow the law while simultaneously setting oneself above it. The role of a believer is to live in accordance with God's commandments, not to assume the position of a judge. This echoes the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized mercy and humility (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>, <a href="/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9-14</a>). The call is to be doers of the word, not merely hearers or judges (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

But the apostolic condemnation is in no way meant to condone a vicious life, and leave it unalarmed and self-contented; for boldness in rebuke thereof we have the example of John the Baptist. All that he reproves is the setting up of our own tribunals, in which we are at once prosecutor, witness, law, lawgiver, and judge; not to say executioner as well. <span class= "ital">Pr?judicium</span> was a merciful provision under Roman law, and often spared the innocent a lengthier after trial; <span class= "ital">but prejudice</span>--our word taken from it--is its most unhappy opposite.
