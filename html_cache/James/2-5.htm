The term "beloved brothers" suggests a familial bond among believers, emphasizing unity and love within the Christian community. This reflects the early church's emphasis on community and mutual care, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-47</a>, where believers shared everything in common.<p><b>Has not God chosen the poor of this world:</b><br>This highlights God's preference for the humble and lowly, aligning with Jesus' teachings in the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>). The "poor" here can be understood both materially and spiritually, indicating those who recognize their need for God. This choice reflects God's upside-down kingdom values, where the last are first (<a href="/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a>).<p><b>to be rich in faith:</b><br>The richness in faith contrasts with material poverty, suggesting that true wealth is found in spiritual abundance. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/luke/12-21.htm">Luke 12:21</a> about being rich toward God. Faith is portrayed as a treasure that surpasses earthly wealth, aligning with <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>, where faith is more precious than gold.<p><b>and to inherit the kingdom He promised:</b><br>The concept of inheritance is significant in biblical theology, often associated with the promises made to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). The kingdom here refers to God's reign, both present and future, as seen in Jesus' parables about the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 13). This inheritance is a gift of grace, not earned by human effort.<p><b>those who love Him:</b><br>Love for God is a central theme in Scripture, encapsulated in the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>). This love is not merely emotional but demonstrated through obedience and faithfulness (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The promise of the kingdom is thus linked to a relationship with God, characterized by love and devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

Calling them &#8220;beloved brothers&#8221; stresses family unity in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>).

Their qualification is neither wealth nor pedigree, but genuine faith expressed in love for God. Earthly poverty can position hearts to grasp heavenly treasure, proving once again that the last will be first in God&#8217;s upside-down economy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Hearken, my beloved brethren.</span>--With complete change of manner the Apostle writes now as if he were speaking, in brief quivering sentences, appealing to the hearts which his stronger words may not compel.<p><span class= "bld">Hath not God chosen . . .?</span>--There is, then, an election on the part of God. It were folly to deny it. But this passage, like so many others, gives the reason for that choice. "The poor of this world" are His chosen; not merely for their poverty, although it may have been the air, so to speak, in which the virtues which endeared them to Him have flourished most. And these are rich for present and for future. They know Him "now by faith," and "after this life have the fruition of His glorious Godhead." "Blessed be ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God" (<a href="/luke/6-20.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.">Luke 6:20</a>). The way thereto for them is nearer and less cumbered than for the rich, if only they fulfil the Scripture (comp. <a href="/matthew/6-3.htm" title="But when you do alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does:">Matthew 6:3</a>), and be poor "in spirit:" then, indeed, are they "heirs of the kingdom which He hath promised to them that love Him." The world must always measure by its own standard, and consider poverty a curse, just as it looks on pain and trouble as evil. But the teaching of God, declared most eloquently in the life of His blessed Son, is the direct opposite to this. In a worship which demands of its votaries costly gifts and offerings--and every religion tends downwards to such desires--the rich man has a golden pavement to his future bliss. No wonder, therefore, that again and again the voice of the Spirit of God has pointed out the narrow way, and the eternal excellency of truth, and faith, and love, the riches easiest of acquisition by the poor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-9.</span> <span class="accented">- Proof of the sinfulness of respect of persons.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearken</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>).
