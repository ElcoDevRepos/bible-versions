This law is called "royal" because it is central to the kingdom of God. In the context of James, fulfilling this law means living in accordance with the teachings of Christ, who emphasized love as the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>). The use of "really" suggests a genuine, heartfelt adherence, not merely a superficial compliance.<p><b>stated in Scripture</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority of the Bible as the source of divine law. The reference to Scripture highlights the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, as the command to love one's neighbor originates from <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>. It reflects the Jewish heritage of the early Christian community, which revered the Hebrew Scriptures as God's revealed word.<p><b>&#8220;Love your neighbor as yourself,&#8221;</b><br>This command is a direct quotation from <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> and is reiterated by Jesus in the Gospels (<a href="/mark/12-31.htm">Mark 12:31</a>). It encapsulates the ethical teachings of both the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing empathy and selflessness. In the cultural context of the time, "neighbor" would have been understood as fellow Israelites, but Jesus expanded this definition to include all people, as seen in the Parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>). This command challenges believers to transcend social, ethnic, and religious boundaries.<p><b>you are doing well.</b><br>This phrase offers affirmation and encouragement to those who live by this command. It suggests that fulfilling the royal law is not only a moral obligation but also a path to spiritual well-being and alignment with God's will. The use of "doing well" implies that such behavior is commendable and aligns with the teachings of Christ, who emphasized love as the fulfillment of the law (<a href="/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>). It serves as a reminder that true faith is demonstrated through actions that reflect God's love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

Mark the touch of irony in the defence which St. James puts into the mouths of his hearers. It were certainly a sweet proof of neighbourly affection, that exemplified in <a href="/james/2-3.htm" title="And you have respect to him that wears the gay clothing, and say to him, Sit you here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand you there, or sit here under my footstool:">James 2:3</a>. The "royal," or "kingly law," is, of course, God's, in its highest utterance; and may be taken as an illustration of what a law really consists: viz., a command from a superior, a duty from an inferior, and a sanction or vindication of its authority. There is much confusion of thought, both scientific and theological, with regard to this; were it not so we should hear less of the "laws of nature," and divers other imaginary codes which the greatest legist of modern times has called "fustian." The sovereign law of love, thus expressed by the Apostle, is one so plain that the simplest mind may be made its interpreter; and the violation of it is at once clear to the offender.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8</span> - What is the connection with the foregoing? <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is ignored altogether by the A.V.

Alford thinks that the apostle is simply guarding his own argument from misconstruction - a view which is simpler and perhaps more natural. <span class="cmt_word">The royal law.</span> Why is the law of love thus styled? (The Syriac has simply "the law of God.") <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As being the most excellent of all laws; as we might call it the sovereign principle of our conduct (cf.
