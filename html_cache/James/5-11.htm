Throughout Scripture, perseverance is often linked with spiritual maturity and blessing (<a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3-4</a>, <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>). The cultural context of the early church, which faced persecution and hardship, underscores the importance of endurance. The Greek word for "blessed" here can also mean "happy" or "fortunate," indicating a state of spiritual well-being that comes from enduring trials faithfully.<p><b>You have heard of Job&#8217;s perseverance</b><br>Job is a quintessential example of steadfastness in the face of extreme suffering. His story, found in the Old Testament, is well-known among Jewish and Christian audiences. Job's perseverance is not just about enduring suffering but maintaining faith and integrity despite losing his wealth, health, and family. This reference serves as a reminder of the historical and cultural significance of Job's story as a model of faithfulness. Job's endurance is also a type of Christ, who suffered innocently and remained faithful to God.<p><b>and have seen the outcome from the Lord.</b><br>The outcome of Job's trials was a restoration and blessing from God, as described in <a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10-17</a>. This serves as a testament to God's faithfulness and justice. The phrase suggests that God's purposes in allowing suffering are ultimately for good, aligning with <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>. The "outcome" also points to the eschatological hope of believers, where ultimate justice and restoration will be realized in God's kingdom.<p><b>The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.</b><br>This statement affirms God's character, emphasizing His loving and merciful nature. Throughout the Bible, God's compassion and mercy are recurring themes (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>). In the context of suffering and perseverance, this assurance provides comfort and hope. Theologically, it underscores the belief that God's dealings with humanity are rooted in His benevolent nature, and His mercy is ultimately demonstrated through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus.

Even when his wife urged him to give up, he replied, &#8220;Shall we accept good from God, and not adversity?&#8221; (<a href="/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>). His story reminds us that trial is not evidence of divine displeasure; sometimes it is a stage on which God displays steadfast faith and sovereign grace (<a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32&#8211;34</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s perseverance was not stoic; he wrestled, grieved, and questioned&#8212;yet he clung to God.<p>&#8226; Perseverance is not passive resignation but active, stubborn trust (<a href="/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have seen the outcome from the Lord</b><p>Readers of Job know the ending: &#8220;The LORD restored Job&#8217;s prosperity&#8230; and gave him twice as much as he had before&#8221; (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>,12).

It is easy to see how these opinions, even among the happier races who had not wandered far from God, gradually hardened into stern rules of judgment, by which each man saw in the chances and calamities of life an immediate effort of an avenging Deity. This was ages before a pious Asaph (Psalms 73) could reflect on the contradiction of experience in this matter, and be troubled at the "prosperity" of the wicked; or before the wise king could notice (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm" title="All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongs his life in his wickedness.">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm" title="There is a vanity which is done on the earth; that there be just men, to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>) the just man perishing "in his righteousness," and the unjust prolonging "his days in wickedness"; "the fishes taken in an evil net," and "the birds caught in the snare" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-12.htm" title="For man also knows not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly on them.">Ecclesiastes 9:12</a>). It was ages earlier still than the presence of that Wiser than Solomon, who spoke of the hapless "eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell"--"Think ye that they were sinners above all?" (<a href="/context/luke/13-4.htm" title="Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think you that they were sinners above all men that dwelled in Jerusalem?">Luke 13:4-5</a>). Job's friends were so certain of his misdeeds, that they would not hear his self-defence; if God tried his endurance, man surely afflicted his patience. We can hear the three in council against him, becoming more zealous as they believe themselves the defenders of God's justice. (See Job 4-22) They are shocked at Job's obstinacy, and annoyed into vehement accusation against him, because he will "hold fast" to his "integrity." It is a damning proof to them of his guilt. Not only had he been wicked, but now actually he is impious and rebellious; such conduct is not to be borne. "Is not thy wickedness great?" says Eliphaz (<a href="/job/22-5.htm" title="Is not your wickedness great? and your iniquities infinite?">Job 22:5</a>). Thou must have--nay, "thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing;" thou couldst not--nay, "thou hast not given water to the weary, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry:" truly thine iniquities are infinite." Now, we know Job was innocent; God Himself bears witness to it (<a href="/job/1-8.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God, and eschews evil?">Job 1:8</a>). And finally the suffering, patient, righteous man was declared to have spoken wisely: as Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar the contrary. They--types of a censorious piety--had conceived of God by their own faulty notions of religion, and fondly deemed they could enter into the motives of the Most High. Job for awhile had seemed to cloud his own belief with baser attributes, as (Job 16 <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) to a God who causelessly dealt in cruelty and pain; but through such fleeting mistakes he rose at last to the full conviction of His perfect truth and justice. It might be that He gave happiness to those who sought Him; it might be He allowed them misery--as the world would call it; but this nor that had part in the matter at issue. Earthly blessings "He gives to whom He wills, or leaves to the powers of nature to distribute among those who fulfil the laws" thereof; but "to serve him and love Him is higher and better than any mundane welfare, though it be with wounded feet and bleeding forehead, or an ash-heap and filthy sores" (Froude). This was the faith to which Job attained: higher, "clearer, purer, there is not possible to man." In such like "patience" it were well for us that we should "possess our souls" (<a href="/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, we count them happy.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>: only here and <a href="/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a> (comp. <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>, "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation;" <a href="/daniel/12-12.htm">Daniel 12:12</a>, "Blessed is he that waiteth"). <span class="cmt_word">Which endure</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which endured</span>, reading <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, Syriac, Latt.
