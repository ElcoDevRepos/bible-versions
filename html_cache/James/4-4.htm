In the Old Testament, Israel is often depicted as God's bride, and idolatry or turning away from God is likened to adultery (e.g., <a href="/hosea/3.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>). This strong language underscores the seriousness of spiritual infidelity. The term "adulteresses" implies a breach of covenant, highlighting the expectation of exclusive devotion to God.<p><b>Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God?</b><br>"Friendship with the world" refers to adopting values and behaviors contrary to God's will. In biblical terms, "the world" often signifies a system opposed to God (1 <a href="/john/2-15.htm">John 2:15-17</a>). This phrase suggests that aligning with worldly values creates enmity with God, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>, where the mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God. The cultural context of James' audience involved pressures to conform to societal norms, which often conflicted with Christian teachings.<p><b>Therefore, whoever chooses to be a friend of the world</b><br>The act of choosing indicates a deliberate decision. This choice reflects a heart posture and allegiance. In the biblical narrative, choices often determine one's relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, where the Israelites are urged to choose whom they will serve. The concept of choice emphasizes personal responsibility and the consequences of aligning with worldly principles.<p><b>renders himself an enemy of God.</b><br>Becoming an enemy of God is a grave consequence, highlighting the incompatibility between God's holiness and worldly values. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>, where one cannot serve two masters. The language of enmity recalls the broader biblical theme of spiritual warfare, where believers are called to resist worldly influences and remain faithful to God (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). The stark dichotomy presented here serves as a warning and a call to repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

Very strange is this sudden exclamation, "<span class="accented">ye</span> adulteresses!" and very difficult to explain. The same word (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) is used as a feminine adjective by our Lord in the expression, "<span class="accented">an</span> evil and adulterous generation" (<a href="/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-4.htm">Matthew 16:4</a>; <a href="/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>); and in this possibly lies the explanation of St. James's use of the term. More probably, however, it should be accounted for as a reminiscence of <a href="/ezekiel/23-45.htm">Ezekiel 23:45</a>, where we read of Samaria and Jerusalem under the titles of Aholah and Aholibah: "The righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; <span class="accented">because they are adulteresses</span>, and blood is in their <span class="accented">hands."</span> It is remarkable too that in <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a> the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, although the Hebrew has the masculine, and <span class="accented">men</span> are evidently referred to. If, then, in the Old Testament the Jewish communities were personified as adulteresses, it is not unnatural for St. James to transfer the epithet to those Judaeo-Christian communities to which he was writing; and the word should probably be taken, just as in the Old Testament, of spiritual fornication, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> apostasy from God, shown in this case, not by actual idolatry, but by that "<span class="accented">friendship</span> of the world" which is "enmity with God," and by "<span class="accented">covetous</span>ness which is idolatry." <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The word occurs here only in the New Testament. With the thought of this verse, compare our Lord's words in <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18, 19</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/james/4-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[You] adulteresses!</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#945;&#955;&#943;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Moichalides)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3428.htm">Strong's 3428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of the feminine of moichos; an adulteress.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Do you not know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7988;&#948;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(oidate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">friendship</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(philia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5373.htm">Strong's 5373: </a> </span><span class="str2">Friendship, affection, fondness, love.
