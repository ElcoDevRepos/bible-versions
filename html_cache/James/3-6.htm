In the context of James, the tongue's potential for harm is likened to a fire, which can start small but quickly spread and cause widespread damage. This metaphor emphasizes the destructive power of words, echoing <a href="/proverbs/16-27.htm">Proverbs 16:27</a>, which describes a "scoundrel" who plots evil and whose speech is like a scorching fire. The tongue's ability to ignite conflict and discord is a recurring theme in biblical wisdom literature.<p><b>A world of wickedness among the parts of the body</b><br>This phrase highlights the tongue's unique capacity to embody and express the sinful nature of humanity. While other parts of the body can commit acts of sin, the tongue can articulate and amplify wickedness, affecting not just the individual but the community. The "world of wickedness" suggests a microcosm of sin, reflecting the broader fallen state of the world. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18-19</a>, where He explains that what comes out of the mouth reflects the heart's condition.<p><b>It pollutes the whole person</b><br>The defilement caused by the tongue extends beyond mere words; it corrupts the entire being. This concept is rooted in the Jewish understanding of purity and impurity, where external actions and words can render a person unclean. The idea is that the tongue's misuse can lead to moral and spiritual contamination, affecting one's relationship with God and others. This is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>, where the prophet laments his "unclean lips" in the presence of God's holiness.<p><b>Sets the course of his life on fire</b><br>The tongue's influence is not limited to isolated incidents; it can shape the trajectory of one's life. This phrase suggests that the consequences of speech can have long-lasting and far-reaching effects, potentially leading to a life characterized by turmoil and destruction. The imagery of a life set on fire recalls the destructive path of the wicked described in <a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14-19</a>, where the way of the wicked is likened to deep darkness.<p><b>And is itself set on fire by hell</b><br>The reference to hell (Gehenna) underscores the tongue's potential for evil as being influenced by demonic forces. Gehenna, a valley outside Jerusalem, was associated with idolatry and child sacrifice in the Old Testament and later became a symbol of divine judgment and eternal damnation. This connection implies that the tongue, when used for evil, aligns with the forces of hell, further emphasizing the seriousness of controlling one's speech. This aligns with Jesus' warnings about the dangers of careless words in <a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36-37</a>, where He speaks of accountability on the day of judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

The Jewish word for the place of torment, the accursed side of Hades, should be thus preserved: whence it was that the rich man of the parable prayed for water to cool his tongue (<a href="/luke/16-24.htm" title="And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.">Luke 16:24</a>).<p>"Speech is silver; silence, gold." But even the Christian world will not endure overmuch the godly discipline of silence. Three temptations "to smite with the tongue" are specially powerful of evil: viz., as a relief from passion, as a gratification of spite, as revenge for wrong. The first is experienced by hot tempered folk; the second yielded to by the malicious; the third welcomed by the otherwise weak and defenceless; and all of us at times are in each of these divisions. Then, again, there are the "foolish talkings" (<a href="/ephesians/5-4.htm" title="Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.">Ephesians 5:4</a>), and worse, the jestings at holy things, and misquotations of Scripture: all to be avoided as not becoming saints. If then we would "walk in love" we must curb the tongue; but, better still, strive to cleanse the heart, and so be quite determined that nothing shall go forth but words of meekness and affection. Nay, if we be truly Christ's, though "reviled" by the unruly tongues of others, we shall, like Him, "revile not again" (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm" title="Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:">1Peter 2:23</a>). And as the whole body is the Lord's to be sanctified to Him (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1Corinthians 6:19</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>so particularly must the tongue be kept from "evil-speaking, lying, and slandering," and used rightly for the service of God. Thus may we truly offer "the calves of our lips" (<a href="/hosea/14-2.htm" title="Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say to him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.">Hosea 14:2</a>), more acceptable than the blood of victims slain on a thousand altars, "than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices" (<a href="/mark/12-23.htm" title="In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.">Mark 12:23</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented"> - Application of illustration</span> The translation is doubtful, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> of the Received Text must certainly be deleted. It is wanting in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, K, Latt., Syriac. Three renderings are then possible. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the wheel of nature." <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "And the tongue is a fire, that world of iniquity: the tongue is among our members that which defileth the whole body," etc.: so Vulgate. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "And the tongue is a fire: that world of iniquity, the tongue, is among our members that which defileth the whole body," etc. Of these, the first, which is that of the Revisers, appears to be preferable. A fourth rendering, which is wholly untenable, deserves notice for its antiquity, viz. that of the Syriac, "The tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity (is the forest)." <span class="cmt_word">The world of iniquity</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). The tongue is thus characterized, because it leads to and embraces all kinds of wickednesses. As Bishop Wordsworth points out, it contains within itself the elements of all mischief. A somewhat similar use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is found in the LXX. of <a href="/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "The whole world of wealth is for the faithful: for the faithless not a penny." <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: "is set" or "<span class="accented">has</span> its place," and so simply "<span class="accented">is."</span> The tongue  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/james/3-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
