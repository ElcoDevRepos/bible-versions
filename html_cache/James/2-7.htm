In the context of James, these are likely wealthy oppressors or those in positions of power who misuse their influence. Blasphemy in the biblical sense is a serious offense, often associated with speaking against God or His attributes. In the Old Testament, blasphemy was punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). The New Testament continues to emphasize the gravity of blasphemy, particularly against the Holy Spirit (<a href="/mark/3-29.htm">Mark 3:29</a>). This phrase highlights the moral and spiritual corruption of those who misuse their power to speak against God and His people.<p><b>the noble name</b><br>The "noble name" refers to the name of Jesus Christ, which believers bear as Christians. In the ancient world, a name was more than just a label; it represented character and authority. The name of Jesus is exalted above every name (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>), and it is through His name that believers find salvation (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>). The use of "noble" underscores the honor and dignity associated with Christ's name, contrasting with the dishonor brought by those who blaspheme it.<p><b>by which you have been called</b><br>This phrase indicates the calling of believers to be identified with Christ. In the New Testament, being "called" often refers to God's invitation to salvation and a life of holiness (<a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). The calling is both a privilege and a responsibility, as it involves living in a manner worthy of the gospel (<a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>). The early Christians were first called "Christians" in Antioch (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>), signifying their association with Christ. This calling sets believers apart from the world and aligns them with the mission and character of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

And it was the scorn and contempt visited upon His Name, which changed the mere abuse and ribaldry into a perilous likeness to the deadliest sin. Most commentators thus restrict the Name here to that of Christ. If their view be correct, the blasphemy would probably be linked with that epithet of "Christian"--then so dishonourable--coined, we are told, first in Antioch (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm" title="And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.">Acts 11:26</a>).
