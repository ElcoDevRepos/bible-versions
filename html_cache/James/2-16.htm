The use of "one of you" indicates that James is addressing believers within the Christian community, emphasizing personal responsibility. This reflects the communal nature of early Christian life, where believers were expected to care for one another, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where the early church shared possessions and resources.<p><b>&#8220;Go in peace;</b><br>The phrase "Go in peace" was a common Jewish farewell, often used to wish someone well. It is reminiscent of the Hebrew word "Shalom," which means peace, completeness, and welfare. This expression is used in various parts of the Bible, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/1-17.htm">1 Samuel 1:17</a> and <a href="/mark/5-34.htm">Mark 5:34</a>, where it signifies a blessing or a dismissal with goodwill. However, in this context, it is used ironically to highlight the inadequacy of mere words without accompanying actions.<p><b>stay warm and well fed,&#8221;</b><br>This part of the verse addresses basic human needs: warmth and food. In the historical context of James' audience, many were poor and struggling, making these necessities particularly relevant. The phrase underscores the importance of practical help over empty words. The Bible frequently emphasizes caring for the needy, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> and <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>, where providing for physical needs is portrayed as a reflection of true faith.<p><b>but does not provide for his physical needs,</b><br>Here, James points out the inconsistency between words and actions. The failure to provide for physical needs is a direct contradiction to the verbal blessing given. This reflects the broader biblical theme that faith without works is dead, as further elaborated in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>. The call to action is rooted in the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized love and service to others, as seen in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>.<p><b>what good is that?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the reader to consider the value of faith that is not accompanied by action. It echoes the teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount, where He warns against empty religious practices (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>). The question serves as a call to self-examination, urging believers to align their actions with their professed faith, as true faith is demonstrated through deeds, reflecting the transformative power of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

This isn&#8217;t about a nameless crowd; it&#8217;s you or me meeting a needy brother or sister face-to-face (<a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33-37</a>). The Spirit presses the question: when compassion walks right up to my doorstep, how do I respond?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go in peace</b><p>A classic Jewish farewell, much like Jesus&#8217; own words in <a href="/mark/5-34.htm">Mark 5:34</a>, &#8220;Go in peace and be healed.&#8221; Spoken sincerely, it conveys blessing and shalom. Yet here it rings hollow&#8212;peace is wished but not delivered. It echoes the empty comfort of Job&#8217;s friends who &#8220;speak worthless words&#8221; (<a href="/job/16-3.htm">Job 16:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Stay warm and well fed</b><p>The speaker recognizes real, concrete needs: warmth against the cold and food against hunger. <a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a> urges, &#8220;Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to act.&#8221; Jesus consistently met these very needs, feeding the five thousand (<a href="/mark/6-41.htm">Mark 6:41-42</a>) and cooking breakfast for His disciples (<a href="/john/21-9.htm">John 21:9-13</a>). To notice need yet remain inactive is to miss His example.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But does nothing to provide for his physical needs</b><p>The indictment lands here. Good intentions without tangible help equal disobedience. John is blunt: &#8220;If anyone has worldly possessions and sees his brother in need but closes his heart, how can God&#8217;s love abide in him?&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>). <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a> portrays judgment hinging on whether we fed, clothed, and welcomed &#8220;the least of these.&#8221; Faith that refuses to roll up its sleeves is faith in name only.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What good is that?</b><p>The rhetorical punchline: it&#8217;s no good at all. Words without works are empty, lifeless, powerless (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). Paul says even the most eloquent speech minus love is &#8220;a noisy gong&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1-3</a>). Genuine faith shows itself in practical mercy; anything less is counterfeit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/james/2-16.htm">James 2:16</a> exposes the gap between polite religious talk and active, obedient love. True faith doesn&#8217;t stop at &#8220;God bless you&#8221;; it steps forward, meets the need, and reflects the Savior who fed the hungry and clothed the naked. Anything else is worthless sentiment, not biblical Christianity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled.</span>--Is it unlikely, knowing as we do the style of the rugged Apostle, that he was drawing other than from the life? Perhaps it was a scene in his own experience during that very famine foretold by Agabus (<a href="/context/acts/11-28.htm" title="And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.">Acts 11:28-30</a>).<p>There would, however, seem to be a worse interpretation of the words, beginning so softly with the Eastern benediction: namely, "Ye are warming and filling yourselves." It is the rebuke of cool prosperity to importunate adversity: "Why such impatience? God is one, and our Father: He will provide." No amount of faith could clothe the shivering limbs and still the hunger pangs; what greater mockery than to be taunted with texts and godly precepts, the usual outcome of a spurious and cheap benevolence.<p><span class= "bld">Notwithstanding ye give them not.</span>--The "one of you" in the beginning of the verse, then, was representative of the whole body addressed by St. James; and now by his use of the plural "ye," we see that no individual was singled out for condemnation: the offence was wider and worse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Depart in peace</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>); cf. <a href="/acts/16-36.htm">Acts 16:36</a>.
