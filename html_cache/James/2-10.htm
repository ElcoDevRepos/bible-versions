The law includes moral, ceremonial, and civil components, and keeping the whole law was seen as an ideal. In the Jewish context, adherence to the law was a sign of faithfulness to God. The law was given at Mount Sinai, and its observance was central to Jewish identity and religious practice.<p><b>but stumbles at just one point</b><br>The idea of stumbling suggests a minor infraction or failure, highlighting human fallibility. In the context of the law, even a small transgression is significant. This reflects the high standard of holiness required by God, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>, "Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy." The concept of stumbling is also echoed in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," indicating universal human imperfection.<p><b>is guilty of breaking all of it</b><br>This statement underscores the indivisibility of the law; breaking one commandment is tantamount to breaking the entire law. This principle is rooted in the unity of God's commandments, reflecting His perfect and unchanging nature. It aligns with <a href="/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>, which states that those who rely on the law are under a curse if they do not continue to do everything written in it. This highlights the impossibility of achieving righteousness through the law alone and points to the need for grace and redemption through Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law perfectly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

Other passages to the same effect may be seen in Schottgen, 'Horae Hebraicae,' vol. 1. p. 1017, etc.; and cf., 'Pirqe Aboth,' 4:15.

"<span class="accented">Whosoever</span> shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of <span class="accented">all</span>," might seem to suggest such an inference: "<span class="accented">To</span> whom," says St. James himself, "<span class="accented">we</span> gave no commandment" (<a href="/acts/15-24.htm">Acts 15:24</a>).
