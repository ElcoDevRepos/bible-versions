The corrosion mentioned here is metaphorical, indicating the futility and temporary nature of earthly riches. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>, where He advises storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth. The imagery of corrosion suggests that what was thought to be lasting is ultimately subject to decay, highlighting the spiritual decay that accompanies the hoarding of wealth.<p><b>Their corrosion will testify against you</b><br>The idea of corrosion testifying against the wealthy implies a legal setting, where the evidence of their greed and misuse of resources stands as a witness in a divine court. This reflects the biblical theme of justice, where God holds individuals accountable for their actions, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>. The corrosion serves as a visible sign of their misplaced trust and priorities, condemning them for their failure to use their resources for God's purposes.<p><b>and consume your flesh like fire.</b><br>Fire is often used in Scripture as a symbol of judgment and purification. Here, it represents the destructive consequences of greed and selfishness. The imagery of flesh being consumed suggests the totality of the judgment, affecting both the physical and spiritual aspects of a person. This aligns with the warnings found in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13-15</a>, where works are tested by fire to reveal their true value.<p><b>You have hoarded treasure in the last days.</b><br>The phrase "last days" refers to the eschatological period between Christ's first and second coming, a time marked by the anticipation of His return. Hoarding treasure during this period is particularly condemned because it reflects a lack of faith in God's provision and a misunderstanding of the times. This connects to the parable of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, where storing up earthly wealth without regard for one's spiritual state is shown to be foolish. The emphasis is on the urgency of living righteously and generously in light of Christ's imminent return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

The simple explanation is an old one--the <span class= "ital">potential</span> nearness of Christ, as it is called. In many ways He has been ever near each individual, as by affliction, or death, or judgment; but His actual return was probably nearer in the first ages of faith than in the brutality of the tenth century, or the splendid atheism of the fifteenth, or the intellectual pride of the nineteenth. His advent is helped or hindered by the state of Christendom itself: "one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" (<a href="/2_peter/3-8.htm" title="But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.">2Peter 3:8</a>), there is: neither past nor future in His sight; only the presence of His own determination: and nought retards Christ's Second Coming so much as the false and feeble Christianity which prays "Thy kingdom come" in frequent words, but waits not as the handmaid of her Lord, with "loins girded about and lights burning" (<a href="/luke/12-35.htm" title="Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;">Luke 12:35</a>), "until the day dawn, and the day star arise" (<a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - With this and the preceding verse contrast our Lord's words of treasure laid up in heaven, "where moth and rust do not corrupt" (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Cankered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); better, <span class="accented">rusted.</span> Only here in the New Testament; never in the LXX. except Ecclus. 12:11. <span class="cmt_word">The rust of them.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: used here for "rust" as in the LXX. in Ezekiel's parable of the boiling pot (<a href="/ezekiel/24-6.htm">Ezekiel 24:6</a>, etc.) - a passage which (according to one interpretation) may have suggested the following clause, "and shall eat your flesh," etc. (see vers. 9-12). <span class="cmt_word">Shall he a witness against you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>). The rendering of the A.V. is quite defensible (see Winer, p. 265), but it is equally possible to take the words as the R.V. margin," for a testimony <span class="accented">unto</span> you." "The rust of them," says Alford, "is a token of what shall happen to yourselves; in the consuming of your wealth you see depicted your own." Two interpretations of the latter part of the verse are possible, depending on the punctuation adopted. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As the A.V. and R.V., putting the stop after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span>: "Their rust... shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days." The "fire," if this rendering be adopted, may be explained from <a href="/ezekiel/24-9.htm">Ezekiel 24:9</a>, etc. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Putting the stop after <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and before <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span>: "Their rust... shall eat your flesh. Ye have heaped up as it were fire in the last days." This has the support of the Syriac ("Ye have gathered fire for you for the last days"), and is adopted by Drs. Westcott and Herr. The "fire" will, of course, be the fire of judgment; and the expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, may easily have been suggested by <a href="/proverbs/16-27.htm">Proverbs 16:27</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span>. The whole form of expression also reminds us of St. Paul's "treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath" (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>), to which it is exactly parallel, the "wrath in the day of wrath" there answering to the "fire in the last days" here. (The rendering of the Vulgate is evidently influenced by this parallel, as it has <span class="accented">thesaurizastis tram.</span>) For the last days; rather, <span class="accented">in the last days</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); cf. <a href="/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a>. If the words are connected with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span> as suggested above, there is no difficulty in them. If the punctuation of the A.V. be retained, we must suppose that the writer is speaking from the point of view of the last day of all. "When the end came it found them heaping up treasures which they could never use" (Dean Scott). But the other view, though not so generally adopted, seems fat' preferable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/james/5-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Your</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hym&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
