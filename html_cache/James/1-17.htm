In the biblical context, "good" and "perfect" gifts refer to blessings that align with God's nature and purposes. The idea of gifts coming "from above" underscores the belief in God's sovereignty and His role as the ultimate source of all blessings. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/7-11.htm">Matthew 7:11</a>, where He speaks of the Father giving good gifts to those who ask Him. The concept of gifts from above also reflects the Jewish understanding of God as the Creator and Sustainer of the universe, who provides for His creation.<p><b>coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights</b><br>This phrase identifies God as the "Father of the heavenly lights," a title that highlights His role as the Creator of the sun, moon, and stars. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, celestial bodies were often associated with deities, but the Bible consistently presents them as creations of the one true God. This title emphasizes God's authority over creation and His ability to bestow gifts. The imagery of "coming down" suggests a continuous and generous outpouring of blessings from God to humanity. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's providence and care, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>, which declares the heavens as a testament to God's glory.<p><b>with whom there is no change or shifting shadow</b><br>This phrase highlights God's unchanging nature, contrasting Him with the variability of the created order. In the ancient world, the movement of celestial bodies was a common metaphor for change and uncertainty. However, God is depicted as constant and reliable, without "shifting shadow." This immutability is a key attribute of God, assuring believers of His faithfulness and dependability. <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a> echoes this sentiment, where God declares, "I the LORD do not change." The assurance of God's unchanging nature provides comfort and stability to believers, reinforcing the trustworthiness of His promises and the consistency of His character.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

Two words are translated by our one "gift"; the first is rather the act of giving, the second the gift itself, and the effect of both together is a climax to the statement of God's benevolence. The difference between the two is observed in the Genevan version of 1557. "There are diversities of gifts" (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm" title="Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.">1Corinthians 12:4</a>), even as "one star differeth from another star in glory" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-41.htm" title="There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differs from another star in glory.">1Corinthians 15:41</a>), but "the same Spirit" is the giver of all. Where in St. John's Gospel (<a href="/john/3-1.htm" title="There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:">John 3:1</a>) we read, "Except a man be born again," the most probable meaning is "from above," expressed exactly as in the present case; and thus we know whence is the true birth of the soul.<p><span class= "bld">Cometh down from the Father of lights.</span>--Great difference of opinion is found concerning these "lights," whether the term be figurative, as of goodness or wisdom; or a reference to the mysterious Urim (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) which flamed on the breast of Aaron; or spiritual, as of grace and glory; or material, viz., the "lights" set "in the firmament of heaven" (<a href="/context/genesis/1-14.htm" title="And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:">Genesis 1:14-15</a>) "when the morning stars sang together" (<a href="/job/38-7.htm" title="When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?">Job 38:7</a>). It were not amiss to take the whole of these interpretations, for they, and perhaps others, the purport of which we as yet can barely guess, are included in this Scripture. "God," remarks Bishop Wordsworth, "is the Father of all lights--the light of the natural world, the sun, the moon, and stars, shining in the heavens; the light of reason and conscience; the light of His Law; the light of prophecy, shining in a dark place; the light of the gospel shining throughout the world; the light of apostles, confessors, martyrs, bishops, and priests, preaching that gospel to all nations; the light of the Holy Ghost shining in our hearts; the light of the heavenly city; God is the Father of them all. He is the everlasting Father of the everlasting Son, who is the Light of the world." But that the mind of the sacred writer was mainly on the lights of the material universe may be seen from his next thought. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every good gift</span>, etc. The words form a hexameter verse, though this is probably accidental, and no sign that they are a quotation. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> should be distinguished.
