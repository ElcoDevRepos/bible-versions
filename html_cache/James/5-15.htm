The context of <a href="/james/5.htm">James 5</a> is a call for the elders of the church to pray over the sick, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord. This practice is rooted in the early church's understanding of communal support and the power of prayer. Faith here is not merely belief but trust in God's power and will, aligning with Jesus' teachings on faith in prayer (<a href="/mark/11-24.htm">Mark 11:24</a>).<p><b>will restore the one who is sick.</b><br>The promise of restoration highlights God's power to heal, both physically and spiritually. The Greek word used for "restore" can also mean "save" or "make whole," indicating a holistic healing. This reflects the biblical theme of God as a healer (<a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>) and is consistent with Jesus' healing ministry (<a href="/matthew/8-16.htm">Matthew 8:16-17</a>). The early church saw physical healing as a sign of God's kingdom breaking into the world, a foretaste of the ultimate restoration in the new creation (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<p><b>The Lord will raise him up.</b><br>This phrase suggests both physical healing and spiritual resurrection. The assurance that "The Lord will raise him up" connects to the resurrection power of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>). It implies that even if physical healing does not occur, there is a promise of ultimate resurrection and eternal life for believers. This dual aspect of healing and resurrection is a central hope in Christian theology, reflecting the victory over sin and death through Jesus (<a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4-5</a>).<p><b>If he has sinned, he will be forgiven.</b><br>This part of the verse links physical illness with spiritual condition, a common understanding in biblical times (<a href="/john/9-2.htm">John 9:2</a>). While not all sickness is a direct result of personal sin, the text acknowledges that sin can have physical consequences. The promise of forgiveness underscores God's grace and the comprehensive nature of salvation. It echoes the assurance found in 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, where confession leads to forgiveness and cleansing. This reflects the holistic approach of the early church, addressing both spiritual and physical needs through prayer and community support.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.
