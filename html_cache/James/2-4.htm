In the context of <a href="/james/2.htm">James 2</a>, the author is confronting the tendency to favor the wealthy over the poor. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God calls His people to treat others with equity and justice, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>, which instructs not to show partiality to the poor or favoritism to the great. The early church, as described in Acts, was meant to be a community where social distinctions were minimized, reflecting the unity in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). The use of "among yourselves" indicates that this issue was internal, affecting the integrity and witness of the church.<p><b>and become judges with evil thoughts?</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the moral and spiritual implications of favoritism. By showing partiality, believers are assuming the role of judges, which is reserved for God alone (<a href="/james/4-12.htm">James 4:12</a>). The "evil thoughts" refer to the corrupt motivations behind such judgments, often rooted in selfishness or societal values rather than God's standards. This echoes Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/7.htm">Matthew 7:1-5</a> about the dangers of judging others. The term "evil" underscores the seriousness of the sin, aligning with the biblical understanding that thoughts and intentions are as significant as actions (<a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>). The call is to align one's heart and mind with God's righteousness, avoiding the worldly mindset that values wealth and status over character and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

The measure we use boomerangs back on us.<p>&#8226; Paul confronts the self-righteous: &#8220;You who pass judgment on someone else are without excuse&#8221; (<a href="/romans/2-1.htm">Romans 2:1</a>).<p>&#8226; God reminded Samuel, &#8220;Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>Setting ourselves up as judges contradicts our calling to be servants (<a href="/mark/10-44.htm">Mark 10:44</a>) and makes us forget that every seat in the church is level at the foot of the cross (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;with evil thoughts&#8221;</b><p>The heart motive behind favoritism is unmasked.<p>&#8226; &#8220;From within the hearts of men come evil thoughts&#8230;greed, malice, deceit&#8221; (<a href="/mark/7-21.htm">Mark 7:21&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah pinpoints the problem: &#8220;The heart is deceitful above all things&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p>&#8226; James later links the same word &#8220;evil&#8221; to selfish ambition (<a href="/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>Partiality springs from desires for gain, approval, or comfort&#8212;sinful impulses that stand opposed to the royal law: &#8220;Love your neighbor as yourself&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-8.htm">James 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/james/2-4.htm">James 2:4</a> shows that favoritism is no small social faux pas; it is a spiritual fault line. When we favor one person over another, we divide Christ&#8217;s body, usurp God&#8217;s throne of judgment, and reveal hearts driven by selfish, evil thoughts. The remedy is simple and radical: look at every brother and sister through the lens of the cross, where grace levels us all and love calls us to honor everyone without distinction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</span>--Or, as the sense, fully expressed, would be: "My brethren, if you acted thus, did you not doubt in yourselves, and become by such false and unfaithful discrimination judges of and in your own evil thoughts? Did you not lose the idea of brotherhood, and become contentious as to supremacy of self and place--serving yourselves while prepared for the service of Christ? The Lord Jesus thought not His equality with God a thing ever to be grasped at, if work for man could be done by self-humiliation. Therefore, although being 'equal to the Father, as touching His Godhead,' He became 'inferior . . . as touching His Manhood.' And none may turn unmoved from that picture of sublime condescension to the petty strifes of quality and position which profane the Christian sanctuary. Most sadly true is it that in making distinctions such as these between rich and poor, we 'become of the number of those who doubt respecting their faith;' for, while it abolishes such altogether in the presence of God, we set them up of our own arrogance and pride. 'We draw nigh unto Him with our mouth, and honour Him with our lips, but our heart is far from Him; and our worship therefore vain.'" (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm" title="Why the Lord said, For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:">Isaiah 29:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-31.htm" title="And they come to you as the people comes, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their covetousness.">Ezekiel 33:31</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/15-8.htm" title="This people draws near to me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.">Matthew 15:8-9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The copula (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>) of the Received Text is certainly spurious.

B also omits the negative <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> (so Westcott and Herr margin). If this manuscript is followed, the sentence must be read as a direct statement, and not as interrogative. But if (with most manuscripts and editions) the interrogative be retained, the translation is still doubtful. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> may mean: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Are ye not divided in your own mind?" so the Syriac and R.V., which would imply that this respect of persons showed that they were halting between God and the world - in fact, double-minded. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Do ye not make distinctions among yourselves?" R.V. margin; this gives an excellent sense, but is wanting in authority, as there appears to be no other instance forthcoming of the passive with this meaning. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "Did you not doubt among yourselves?" this (doubt) is the almost invariable meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the New Testament, and the word has already been used in this sense by St. James (<a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a>). Hence this rendering is to be preferred. So Huther, Plumptre, and Farrar, the latter of whom explains the passage as follows: "It shows <span class="accented">doubt to</span> act as though Christ had never promised his kingdom to the poor, rich in faith; and <span class="accented">wicked reasonings</span> to argue mentally that the poor <span class="accented">must</span> be less worthy of honor than the rich."
