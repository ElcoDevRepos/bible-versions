It reflects a common rhetorical device used by biblical writers to address their audience directly. The phrase suggests a sense of urgency and importance, indicating that the following message is crucial for the listeners' spiritual understanding and growth.<p><b>&#8220;Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the presumption of making plans without considering God's will. In the ancient world, travel was fraught with uncertainty and danger, making such statements bold and potentially reckless. The reference to "this or that city" suggests a lack of specificity, emphasizing the human tendency to make plans based on personal desires rather than divine guidance. This echoes <a href="/proverbs/27.htm">Proverbs 27:1</a>, which warns against boasting about tomorrow.<p><b>spend a year there</b><br>The mention of spending a year indicates a long-term commitment and investment in the plans being made. In biblical times, a year was a significant period for business ventures, reflecting the agricultural and trade cycles. This phrase underscores the human inclination to assume control over time, which is ultimately in God's hands, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</a>.<p><b>carry on business</b><br>The phrase refers to engaging in trade or commerce, a common practice in the ancient Near East. Cities like Tyre and Sidon were known for their bustling trade activities. The Bible often addresses the ethical and spiritual implications of business, urging believers to conduct their affairs with integrity and reliance on God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>.<p><b>and make a profit.&#8221;</b><br>The desire to make a profit reflects the human pursuit of wealth and success. While the Bible does not condemn profit itself, it warns against the love of money and the dangers of greed, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>. This phrase challenges believers to consider their motivations and to prioritize spiritual riches over material gain, aligning with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a> about storing treasures in heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.
