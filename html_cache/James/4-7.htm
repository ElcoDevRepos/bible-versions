The Greek word for "submit" is "hypotass&#333;," which implies a readiness to obey and align oneself under God's command. This submission is a response to the grace and humility discussed earlier in the chapter, where God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). The act of submission is foundational in the Christian life, echoing the call to deny oneself and take up one's cross (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>). It reflects the biblical theme of surrendering personal desires in favor of God's purposes, as seen in Jesus' submission to the Father (<a href="/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>). This submission is not passive but an active, conscious decision to trust and follow God, aligning with the call to be living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>Resist the devil,</b><br>The command to resist the devil involves standing firm against the temptations and deceptions that he presents. The term "resist" suggests a defensive posture, akin to a soldier holding his ground. This resistance is not done in human strength but through the power of God, as believers are called to put on the full armor of God (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11-18</a>). The devil, or Satan, is portrayed in Scripture as the adversary and accuser, seeking to devour (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). Historical context shows that early Christians faced significant spiritual and physical opposition, making this exhortation particularly relevant. The resistance involves both rejecting sin and clinging to righteousness, as seen in Jesus' own resistance to Satan's temptations in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<p><b>and he will flee from you.</b><br>This promise assures believers of victory over the devil when they stand firm in faith. The assurance that the devil will flee is rooted in the authority of Christ, who has already defeated Satan through His death and resurrection (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>). The imagery of fleeing suggests a retreat, indicating that the devil's power is limited and can be overcome by those who are steadfast in their faith. This echoes the promise that God will not allow believers to be tempted beyond what they can bear and will provide a way out (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>). The historical context of persecution and spiritual warfare faced by the early church underscores the importance of this promise, offering hope and encouragement to remain faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.
