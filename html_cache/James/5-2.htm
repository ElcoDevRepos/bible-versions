In biblical times, wealth was often measured in terms of agricultural produce, livestock, and stored goods, which were susceptible to decay and spoilage. The imagery of rotting riches serves as a stark reminder of the impermanence of earthly possessions. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>, where He advises storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth, where moth and rust destroy. The rotting of riches symbolizes the futility of placing trust in material wealth, which can be lost or devalued over time.<p><b>and moths have eaten your clothes.</b><br>In the ancient world, clothing was a significant indicator of wealth and status. Fine garments were treasured possessions, often passed down through generations. Moths eating clothes signifies the vulnerability and fleeting nature of even the most prized material goods. This imagery is consistent with the warnings found in <a href="/isaiah/51-8.htm">Isaiah 51:8</a>, where the prophet speaks of moths consuming garments as a metaphor for the temporary nature of human achievements and pride. The reference to moths also connects to the broader biblical theme of divine judgment against those who prioritize earthly wealth over spiritual riches. This serves as a call to repentance and a reminder of the eternal value found in a life devoted to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

James addresses believers who have accumulated wealth but neglected godly stewardship.<p>&#8226; Scripture treats riches as tangible possessions&#8212;money, land, produce, investments&#8212;not merely ideas (cf. <a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that every material asset is entrusted by God for His purposes (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Hoarded wealth that sits idle exemplifies misplaced security, contrasting with the command, &#8220;Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; James echoes Jesus&#8217; warning that worldly treasure reveals the heart&#8217;s allegiance: &#8220;For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Have rotted</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Your riches have rotted&#8221; speaks of literal decay&#8212;grain spoiling in barns, produce wasting in storage, coins corroding (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb paints wealth as temporary; it can perish before its owner enjoys it (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word affirms that material prosperity has no power on &#8220;the day of wrath&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Rotting riches illustrate judgment: what was withheld from the needy now testifies against its holder (<a href="/james/5-3.htm">James 5:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moths have eaten</b><p>&#8226; Fine garments symbolized status in the ancient world, yet moths silently destroy them (<a href="/isaiah/50-9.htm">Isaiah 50:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus used the same image: &#8220;where moth and rust destroy&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The silent, unseen action of moths highlights how quickly earthly glory fades (<a href="/1_peter/1-24.htm">1 Peter 1:24</a>).<p>&#8226; God allows natural decay to expose the folly of trusting in appearances rather than in Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your clothes</b><p>&#8226;

James confronts the sin of accumulating luxury while laborers cry out for fair wages (<a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture contrasts perishable garments with the imperishable &#8220;white garments&#8221; Christ offers (<a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The condition of one&#8217;s closet can reveal spiritual health: generosity clothes the poor, whereas hoarding evidences pride (<a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/james/5-2.htm">James 5:2</a> declares that wealth and wardrobe, when idolized or hoarded, will literally decay and become evidence against their owners.

Winer, 'Grammar of New Testament Greek,' p. 342: "The perfect does not stand for a present or future, but the case indicated by the apostle in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is viewed as already present, and consequently the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of the riches as already completed"). For an instance of the prophetic perfect, used as here after <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>, see <a href="/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1, 14</a>," Howl.... for your stronghold <span class="accented">has been wasted."</span> The miseries coming upon the rich are thus announced to be the destruction of everything in virtue of which they were styled rich. Their costly garments, in a great store of which the wealth of an Eastern largely consists, should become moth-eaten. Their gold and silver should be rusted. Bengel notes on this passage: "Scripta haec suut paucis annis ante obsidionem Hierosolymorum;" and certainly the best commentary upon it is to be found in the terrible account given by Josephus of the sufferings and miseries which came upon the Jews during the war and siege of Jerusalem. The Jewish historian has become the unconscious witness to the fulfillment of the prophecies of our Lord and his apostle. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>: only here in the New Testament; in the LXX., <a href="/job/16-7.htm">Job 16:7</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> is also an <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in the New Testament; in LXX. used also of garments in <a href="/job/13-28.htm">Job 13:28</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/james/5-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Your</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hym&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
