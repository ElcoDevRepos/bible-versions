In the context of James, the audience is primarily Jewish Christians familiar with the Law and teachings of Jesus. The "right thing" refers to actions aligned with God's will, as revealed through Scripture and the teachings of Christ. This echoes the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47-48</a>, where greater knowledge brings greater responsibility. The phrase also connects to the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as Proverbs, which emphasizes the importance of knowing and doing what is right.<p><b>yet fails to do it</b><br>This part highlights the sin of omission, which is failing to act when one knows they should. In biblical terms, this is as serious as committing a wrongful act. The parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>) illustrates this principle, where the priest and Levite's failure to help the injured man is a sin of omission. The cultural context of the time placed a strong emphasis on community and mutual responsibility, making inaction particularly grievous.<p><b>is guilty of sin</b><br>The conclusion of the verse underscores the seriousness of inaction. Sin, in this context, is not just about breaking a commandment but failing to live up to the standards of righteousness set by God. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that sin separates humanity from God, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>. Theologically, this phrase reinforces the need for repentance and the transformative power of grace through Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the Law and offers redemption for all sins, both of commission and omission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

Probably both ideas are correct. We learn the converse to the evil of vainglory in life, namely, the good which may be wrought by every one. Occasions of well-doing lie in the abject at our doors, and the pleadings of pity in our very hearts. And thus it is that omission is at times worse than commission; and more souls are in jeopardy for things left undone than for things done. In "The Beautiful Legend" there is a strife between the call of duty to give out a dole of bread to the hungry, and the temptation to linger in religious ecstasy over a vision of Christ. But the true brother knew "to do good," and did it; and, returning at the end of his work, found his cell full of the radiant presence of the Lord, and heard the words of rich approval--<p>"Hadst thou stayed, I must have fled."<p>And again, in another succession of thoughts on the text, God has no need of human knowledge; no, nor of our ignorance; "and it is a sin to shut the ears to instruction: it is a duty to get knowledge, to increase in knowledge, to abound in knowledge." Nor must we rest therein, but (<a href="/context/2_peter/1-6.htm" title="And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;">2Peter 1:6-7</a>) "add to knowledge temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, charity."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- Conclusion of the section.</span> "Some have supposed a direct reference to <a href="/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a>, 'Whatsover is not of faith is sin.'
