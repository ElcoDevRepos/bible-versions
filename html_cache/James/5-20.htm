It emphasizes the weight and significance of the action being described. In biblical literature, such calls to attention are often used to highlight moral or spiritual truths that require careful consideration and action.<p><b>Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way</b><br>This phrase underscores the responsibility and privilege of believers to guide others back to the truth. The concept of "turning" is akin to repentance, a central theme in both the Old and New Testaments. The "error of his way" refers to a path leading away from God's commandments, reminiscent of the warnings given by prophets like Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30-32</a>) and the call to repentance by John the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>). The communal aspect of faith is highlighted here, where believers are encouraged to support one another in spiritual growth and correction.<p><b>will save his soul from death</b><br>The "soul" in this context refers to the whole being of a person, not just the immaterial part. "Death" here is often interpreted as spiritual death, which is separation from God, rather than physical death. This aligns with the biblical teaching that sin leads to death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>), but repentance and turning back to God lead to life. The act of saving a soul from death is seen as participating in God's redemptive work, echoing the mission of Christ who came to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><b>and cover over a multitude of sins.</b><br>This phrase suggests the idea of forgiveness and atonement. The imagery of "covering" sins is rooted in the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where the blood of sacrifices symbolically covered the sins of the people (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). In the New Testament, this is fulfilled in the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood covers and cleanses from all sin (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>). The "multitude of sins" indicates the vastness of God's grace and forgiveness, as also reflected in <a href="/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a>, which states that love covers all wrongs. This phrase encourages believers to act in love and grace, participating in the ministry of reconciliation (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

Probably the one was consciously or unconsciously influenced by the other. The striking position which the words occupy <span class="accented">here</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> those with which the Epistle closes, would make them linger in the memory; and there is nothing to militate against the conclusion, which appeared probable on the occasion of previous coincidences between the two writers, that St. James is the earlier of the two (comp. on James 4:6). The expression used by the apostle leaves it undetermined <span class="accented">whose</span> sins are thus "covered," whether <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> those of the man who is "<span class="accented">converted</span> from the error of his way," or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> those of the man who wins him back, and through this good action obtains, by the grace of God, pardon for his own "multitude of sins." It has been well noticed that "<span class="accented">there</span> is a studied generality in the form of the teaching which seems to emphasize the wide blessedness of love. In the very act of seeking to convert one for whom we care we must turn to God ourselves, and in covering the past sins of another our own also are covered. In such an act love reaches its highest point, and that love includes the faith in God which is the condition of forgiveness" (Plumptre). The Epistle ends abruptly, with no salutation and no doxology. In this it stands almost by itself in the New Testament; the First Epistle of St. John alone approaching it in the abruptness of its conclusion. <p>  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/james/5-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">consider</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#954;&#941;&#964;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(gin&#333;sket&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1097.htm">Strong's 1097: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb; to 'know' in a great variety of applications and with many implications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this:</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Whoever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
