The commandments were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai, serving as a moral foundation for the Israelites. Adultery, in the biblical context, is not only a violation of marital vows but also a sin against God, who instituted marriage. The commandment underscores the sanctity of marriage and the importance of faithfulness. In the New Testament, Jesus expands on this commandment in <a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>, emphasizing that even lustful thoughts are equivalent to adultery, thus highlighting the heart's condition.<p><b>also said, &#8220;Do not murder.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase refers to the sixth commandment, found in <a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/5-17.htm">Deuteronomy 5:17</a>. Murder is the unlawful taking of a human life, which is sacred because humans are made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). The prohibition against murder underscores the value God places on human life. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus deepens this commandment by teaching that anger and hatred towards others are akin to murder (<a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>). This reflects the principle that sin originates in the heart and that God&#8217;s law addresses both actions and intentions.<p><b>If you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder,</b><br>This phrase illustrates the indivisibility of the law. James emphasizes that breaking one commandment makes one guilty of breaking the entire law. This reflects the holistic nature of the law, where each commandment is interconnected. The Pharisees in Jesus' time often focused on external adherence to the law, but James, like Jesus, points to the internal consistency required by God. The law is not a checklist but a unified expression of God&#8217;s will.<p><b>you have become a lawbreaker.</b><br>This phrase highlights the concept of sin and guilt in the biblical context. According to James, partial obedience is insufficient; breaking any part of the law results in being a transgressor. This underscores the need for grace and the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law perfectly (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The law serves to reveal human sinfulness and the need for a Savior (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). James&#8217; message aligns with the broader New Testament teaching that faith in Christ, rather than adherence to the law, is the basis for righteousness (<a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally understood to be James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

God&#8217;s design for marriage is covenant faithfulness; breaking that covenant strikes at His picture of Christ and the church (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31&#8211;32</a>). Jesus raised the bar in <a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>, teaching that lustful intent also violates this command. The call is to wholehearted purity, not mere avoidance of an outward act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>also said</b><p>The same Lord who forbids adultery issues every other command. <a href="/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22</a> notes that God spoke &#8220;these words with a loud voice&#8230;and He added no more,&#8221; showing the unity of the law. <a href="/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a> warns that relying on law-keeping requires perfect, comprehensive obedience. Selective compliance ignores the indivisible authority of the Lawgiver.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Do not murder.&#8221;</b><p>Quoting the sixth commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>), James shifts to the sanctity of life. <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a> grounds this in humanity bearing God&#8217;s image, while Jesus broadens the principle to angry contempt in <a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>. Taking life&#8212;or harboring murderous hatred&#8212;opposes God&#8217;s protective heart for His creation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If you do not commit adultery,</b><p>Someone might claim moral standing by avoiding one serious sin. Jesus confronted this selective righteousness in the rich young ruler (<a href="/luke/18-20.htm">Luke 18:20-22</a>). <a href="/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-23</a> shows that boasting in partial obedience still leaves us exposed if we fail elsewhere.

James echoes this to reveal the folly of thinking &#8220;I&#8217;m fine because I avoid that sin,&#8221; while ignoring another.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you have become a lawbreaker.</b><p>One violation brands us guilty of the entire law, as James just stated: &#8220;Whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>). <a href="/galatians/5-3.htm">Galatians 5:3</a> presses the same point&#8212;choosing law as the basis for acceptance means being &#8220;obligated to obey the whole law.&#8221; <a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19-20</a> concludes that every mouth is silenced and the whole world accountable to God, driving us to grace in Christ alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/james/2-11.htm">James 2:11</a> teaches that God&#8217;s moral law stands as a unified expression of His character. Because the same Lord issued every command, breaking even one makes us a transgressor of the whole. Selective obedience cannot justify us; instead, it exposes our need for the mercy that triumphs over judgment through Jesus Christ (<a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">For he that said . . .</span>--All men have favourite vices and indulgences; and most<p>"Compound for sins they have a mind to<p>By damning those they're not inclined to;"<p>forgetful that the same Lawgiver has laid His restrictions upon every sort and kind. Not that we can believe all sins are the same in their deadening effect upon the soul, or, further, in their punishment. The point which St. James urges is that sin, as sin, involves the curse of the law; and that "respect of persons," with its unloving and unlovely results, must bring its deceived possessor into condemnation before God. Just as our Lord referred the Sixth and Seventh Commandments (<a href="/context/matthew/5-21.htm" title="You have heard that it was said of them of old time, You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:">Matthew 5:21-32</a>) to the first issues of the angry or lustful heart, and by no means confined them as did the Rabbinical teachers to the very act, so now in like manner the Apostle takes his stand upon the guiltiness of any breach whatever of the Law. Love is its complete fulfilment, we are well informed (<a href="/romans/13-10.htm" title="Love works no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.">Romans 13:10</a>), but in that startling briefness lies comprehended all the decalogue, with its utmost ramifications; and men of the world would find a rule of the most minute and rigid ceremony easier to be followed than this simple all-embracing one. "<span class= "ital">The fulfilling</span> of the Law" is very different from the substitution of a single plain command for a difficult code; this would seem to be the mistake of many, noisily asserting their freedom from the older obligations, who do not so evidently live under the mild bondage of the new.<p>A curious question may be raised upon the inverted order of the Sixth and Seventh Commandments in this passage, as well as in <a href="/mark/10-19.htm" title="You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor your father and mother.">Mark 10:19</a>; <a href="/luke/18-20.htm" title="You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and your mother.">Luke 18:20</a>; <a href="/romans/13-9.htm" title="For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Romans 13:9</a>. (Not so however, observe, in the sermon on the Mount, <a href="/context/matthew/5-21.htm" title="You have heard that it was said of them of old time, You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:">Matthew 5:21-27</a>.) Professor Plumptre says they are thus placed because "standing first in the second table, the Fifth being classed by most Jewish writers as belonging to the first," and "there was, probably, a traditional order of the Tenth, varying from that at present found in the Hebrew Pentateuch." The Greek version, known as the Septuagint, supports this theory, placing "Thou shalt not commit adultery" in <a href="/james/2-13.htm" title="For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy rejoices against judgment.">James 2:13</a> of Exodus 20, and "Thou shalt not kill" in <a href="/james/2-15.htm" title="If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,">James 2:15</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do not commit adultery... do not kill.</span> The order of the commandments is remarkable; what is now the seventh is placed bolero the sixth. This appears to have been the usual order at that time. In this order our Lord quotes them in <a href="/luke/18-20.htm">Luke 18:20</a>, and St. Paul in <a href="/romans/13-9.htm">Romans 13:9</a>. Philo also has the same order, and expressly comments on it, drawing from it an argument for the heinousness of adultery ('Dec.,' 12:24). In the Vatican Manuscript of the LXX. in <a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13-15</a> the order is, "<span class="accented">Thou</span> shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not kill." But the Alexandrian Manuscript has the usual order, which is also found in <a href="/matthew/19-18.htm">Matthew 19:18</a> and <a href="/mark/10-19.htm">Mark 10:19</a> (according to the correct reading). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/james/2-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
