The Greek word for "conflicts" can also mean "wars," indicating serious disputes. The early church, composed of diverse backgrounds, faced challenges in maintaining unity. This echoes Jesus' teachings on peacemaking (<a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>) and Paul's exhortations to live in harmony (<a href="/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>). The question implies self-examination, urging believers to consider the root of their disputes, which often stem from selfish desires rather than external circumstances.<p><b>Don&#8217;t they come from the passions at war within you?</b><br>The "passions" refer to desires that are often selfish and contrary to God's will. The Greek term used here is "hedonon," from which we derive "hedonism," indicating a pursuit of pleasure. This internal battle is reminiscent of Paul's struggle described in <a href="/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a>, where he speaks of the law of sin waging war within his members. The imagery of war suggests a fierce internal conflict, highlighting the need for spiritual discipline and reliance on the Holy Spirit to overcome these desires. This internal struggle is a common theme in Scripture, emphasizing the need for believers to crucify the flesh (<a href="/galatians/5-24.htm">Galatians 5:24</a>) and live by the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

The wording highlights that these &#8220;conflicts and quarrels&#8221; are not rare flare-ups but ongoing skirmishes within the fellowship.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently ties open strife to pride and self-seeking: &#8220;Where there is strife, there is pride&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/13-10.htm">Proverbs 13:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul confronted the same pattern in Corinth: &#8220;For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not worldly?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Even godly communities can slide into biting and devouring one another if the flesh is indulged (<a href="/galatians/5-15.htm">Galatians 5:15</a>).<p>James refuses to blame circumstances, personalities, or outside opposition. The Spirit-inspired focus is inward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Don&#8217;t they come from the passions at war within you?</b><p>James answers his own question, exposing the root: internal &#8220;passions&#8221;&#8212;strong desires bent toward self-gratification.<p>&#8226; Jesus taught that evil actions flow &#8220;from within, out of men&#8217;s hearts&#8221; (<a href="/mark/7-21.htm">Mark 7:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter warns believers to &#8220;abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul describes the same civil war: &#8220;I see another law at work in my body, warring against the law of my mind&#8221; (<a href="/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a>).<p>Those passions&#8212;envy, covetousness, pride, lust for recognition&#8212;demand to be served. When two believers each insist on satisfying self, conflict is inevitable. Yet the Spirit supplies power to deny the flesh (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/james/4-1.htm">James 4:1</a> lays the ax to the root of every church fight or personal feud: the problem is not mainly &#8220;them&#8221; but the selfish cravings warring inside &#8220;me.&#8221; Scripture calls us to own that truth, repent of prideful desires, and walk by the Spirit, whose fruit is peace. External harmony grows only when internal passions are surrendered to Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">From whence come wars . . .?</span>--More correctly thus. <span class= "ital">Whence are wars, and whence fightings among you</span>? The perfect peace above, capable, moreover, in some ways, of commencement here below, dwelt upon at the close of James 3, has by inevitable reaction led the Apostle to speak suddenly, almost fiercely, of the existing state of things. He traces the conflict raging around him to the fount and origin of evil within.<p><span class= "bld">Come they not . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">come they not hence, even from your lusts warring in your members</span>? The term is really <span class= "ital">pleasures, </span>but in an evil sense, and therefore "lusts." "The desires of various sorts of pleasures are," says Bishop Moberly, "like soldiers in the devil's army, posted and picketed all over us, in the hope of winning our members, and so ourselves, back to his allegiance, which we have renounced in our baptism." St. Peter (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a>) thus writes in the same strain of "fleshly lusts, which war against the soul"; and St. Paul knew also of this bitter strife in man, if not actually in himself, and could "see another law" in his members--the natural tendency of the flesh--"warring against the law of his mind, and bringing him into captivity to the law of sin which is in his members" (<a href="/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>). See also Note on <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>.<p>Happily the Christian philosopher understands this; and with the very cry of wretchedness, "Who shall deliver me?" can answer, "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord" (<a href="/context/romans/7-24.htm" title="O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?">Romans 7:24-25</a>). But the burden of this hateful depravity drove of old men like Lucretius to suicide rather than endurance; and its mantle of despair is on all the religions of India at the present time--matter itself being held to be evil, and eternal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - REBUKE OF QUARRELS ARISING FROM PRIDE AND GREED.

In behalf of its secondary meaning, "contention," Grimm ('Lexicon of New Testament Greek') appeals to Sophocles, 'Electra,' 1. 219, and Plato, 'Phaed.,' p. 66, c.

Ver. <span class="cmt_sub_title">2 gives us an insight into the terrible difficulties with which the apostles</span> had to contend. Those to whom St. James was writing were guilty of lust, which actually led to murder. So the charge in <a href="/1_peter/4-15.htm">1 Peter 4:15</a> evidently presupposes the possibility of a professing Christian suffering as a murderer or thief. <span class="cmt_word">Ye kill</span>.

There is no variation in the manuscripts or ancient versions. All alike have <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. But, owing to the startling character of the expression in an address to Christians, Erasmus suggested that perhaps <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "ye envy," was the original reading, and actually inserted it in the second edition of his Greek Testament (1519). In his third edition (1522) he wisely returned to the true reading, although, strangely enough, he retained the false one, "<span class="accented">invidetis</span>," in his Latin version, whence it passed into that of Beza and others. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> appears, however, in a few later editions, e.g. three editions published at Basle, 1524 (Bebelius), 1546 (Herwagius), and 1553 (Beyling), in that of Henry Stephens, 1576; and even so late as 1705 is found in an edition of Oritius. In England the reading obtained a wide currency, being actually adopted in all the versions in general use previous to that of 1611, viz. those of Tyndale, Coverdale, Taverner, the Bishops Bible, and the Geneva Version. The Authorized Version relegated it to the margin, from which it has been happily excluded by the Revisers, and thus, it is to be hoped, it has finally disappeared. <span class="cmt_word">Ye kill, and desire to have.</span> The combination is certainly strange. Dean Scott sees in the terms a possible allusion to "the well-known politico-religious party of the zealots," and <span class="accented">suggests</span> the rendering, "<span class="accented">ye</span> play the murderers and zealots." It is, perhaps, more probable that <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> simply refers to covetousness; cf. the use of the word (although with a better meaning) in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1, 39</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/james/4-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">What [causes]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#972;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Pothen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4159.htm">Strong's 4159: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of posis with enclitic adverb of origin; from which or what place, state, source or cause.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">conflicts</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#972;&#955;&#949;&#956;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(polemoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4171.htm">Strong's 4171: </a> </span><span class="str2">A war, battle, strife.
