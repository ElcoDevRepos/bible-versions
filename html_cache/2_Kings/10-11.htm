Jezreel was a significant location, being the site of Naboth's vineyard, which Ahab and Jezebel unjustly seized, leading to their downfall. This act of judgment by Jehu was seen as divine retribution for the sins of Ahab's house.<p><b>as well as all his great men and close friends and priests</b><br>Jehu's purge extended beyond Ahab's immediate family to include his political and religious supporters. This reflects the comprehensive nature of Jehu's mission to eradicate Baal worship and the influence of Ahab's dynasty. The priests mentioned here were likely those who served Baal, as Ahab and Jezebel had promoted Baal worship in Israel, leading the nation into idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31-33</a>).<p><b>leaving him without a single survivor</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of Jehu's actions, ensuring that no one from Ahab's lineage or his supporters could rise to power again. It highlights the severity of God's judgment against those who lead His people astray. This complete destruction is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God commanded the total annihilation of sinful nations or peoples, such as the Amalekites (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>).

Just as Elijah called down fire on Mount Carmel to cleanse Israel of Baal worship (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38-40</a>), Jehu now cleanses Jezreel. The text stresses that the judgment happened &#8220;in Jezreel,&#8221; the very place where Ahab once schemed for Naboth&#8217;s vineyard (<a href="/1_kings/21-1.htm">1 Kings 21:1-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who remained of the house of Ahab</b><p>God had decreed, &#8220;Every one belonging to Ahab shall perish&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/10-10.htm">2 Kings 10:10</a>; cf. <a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>). Jehu&#8217;s action fulfills that word to the letter. Nothing here is excessive or accidental; it is the precise execution of divine justice against a dynasty that had plunged Israel into idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as well as all his great men</b><p>The &#8220;great men&#8221; were officials who maintained Ahab&#8217;s policies. Removing them prevents any resurgence of Baal worship. When leaders are corrupt, judgment often reaches the entire governing structure (<a href="/psalms/101-3.htm">Psalm 101:3-4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a> shows Josiah doing something similar generations later).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and close friends</b><p>Those closest to Ahab shared his guilt (<a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>), enabling and benefiting from his rule. By eliminating this inner circle, Jehu cuts every social tie that could rally support for the old regime.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and priests</b><p>These are Baal&#8217;s priests, not Yahweh&#8217;s. Elijah had earlier slain many of them on Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19, 40</a>), yet the cult survived. Jehu finishes the work (<a href="/2_kings/10-18.htm">2 Kings 10:18-28</a>). <a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a> commands Israel to remove idolatrous leaders; Jehu obeys that enduring principle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>leaving him without a single survivor</b><p>The phrase echoes the prophecy &#8220;I will cut off from Ahab every male&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21</a>). The completeness shows that God&#8217;s word is neither partial nor negotiable (<a href="/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a>). Judgment is final, thorough, and entirely just.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/10-11.htm">2 Kings 10:11</a> records the exact, total fulfillment of God&#8217;s earlier pronouncements against Ahab&#8217;s line. Jehu, raised up by the LORD, removes every person&#8212;relative, official, confidant, or priest&#8212;who could revive the wicked dynasty or its idolatry. The verse underscores two unchanging truths: God&#8217;s promises of judgment are as certain as His promises of mercy, and He expects His people to break decisively with sin so true worship can flourish.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">So.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And</span>.

Encouraged by his past success, having killed Jehoram, Ahaziah, and Jezebel, having secured the adhesion of the chief men in Samaria, and effected the destruction of all those who might naturally have claimed the succession and involved him in civil war, Jehu proceeded to greater lengths. He "slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel" - the princesses probably, as well as the princes - and further put to death all the leading partisans of the dethroned dynasty, the "great men," perhaps even those who had worked his bloody will at Samaria, and the intimate friends and supporters of the house - the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5bb;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, as they are here called - not relatives, but "intimate acquaintances." <span class="cmt_word">And his priests.</span> This expression causes a difficulty, since the destruction of the Baal-priests is related subsequently (vers. 19-25).
