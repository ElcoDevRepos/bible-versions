The context is a time of political instability in the region, with power struggles common among neighboring kingdoms. The quick succession suggests premeditation and urgency in Hazael's plan.<p><b>Hazael took a thick cloth</b><br>Hazael, previously a servant of the king, is now taking decisive action to change his status. The use of a "thick cloth" suggests a methodical approach to ensure the king's death. This act of regicide reflects the brutal and often violent nature of ancient Near Eastern politics, where coups and assassinations were not uncommon.<p><b>dipped it in water</b><br>Dipping the cloth in water could serve to make it more effective in suffocating the king. Water-soaked cloths would adhere more closely to the face, ensuring the king's death. This detail underscores the calculated and deliberate nature of Hazael's actions.<p><b>and spread it over the king&#8217;s face</b><br>This act of suffocation is a direct and personal method of murder, indicating Hazael's resolve and willingness to commit such an act himself. It also reflects the vulnerability of kings despite their power, as even they could fall victim to betrayal from within their own ranks.<p><b>So Ben-hadad died</b><br>Ben-hadad's death marks the end of his reign and the fulfillment of Elisha's prophecy regarding Hazael's rise to power (<a href="/2_kings/8-13.htm">2 Kings 8:13</a>). This event is a turning point in the narrative, demonstrating the fulfillment of divine prophecy and the shifting of political power in the region.<p><b>and Hazael reigned in his place</b><br>Hazael's ascension to the throne fulfills the prophecy given by Elisha, highlighting the theme of divine sovereignty over the affairs of nations. Hazael's reign would have significant implications for Israel, as he would become a formidable adversary.

Ewald objects that if Hazael were meant, his name would not occur where it does at the end of the verse. But the objection does not hold, for in relating who succeeded to the throne, it was natural to give the name of the new king. Further, a considerable pause must be understood at "he died." The Judaean editor of Kings then appropriately concludes: "So Hazael reigned in his stead." The mention of the name significantly reminds us that Elisha had designated Hazael as the future king. Besides, after the words "and he died," it would have been more ambiguous than usual to add, "and <span class= "ital">he</span> reigned in his stead."<p><span class= "bld">A thick cloth.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the quilt</span>, or <span class= "ital">coverlet.</span> So the LXX., Vulg., Targum, and Arabic. The Syriac renders "curtain;" and, accordingly, Gesenius and others translate, "mosquito net." The Hebrew term (<span class= "ital">makb?r</span>) means, etymologically, something <span class= "ital">plaited</span> or <span class= "ital">interwoven</span>. It is not found elsewhere, but a word of the same root occurs in <a href="/1_samuel/19-13.htm" title="And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.">1Samuel 19:13</a>. It is clear from the context that the <span class= "ital">makb?r</span> must have been something which when soaked in water, and laid on the face, would prevent respiration.<p>Josephus says Hazael <span class= "ital">strangled</span> his master with a mosquito net. But this and other explanations, such as that of Ewald, do not suit the words of the text. The old commentator, Clericus, may be right when he states Hazae?s <span class= "ital">motive</span> to have been <span class= "ital">ut hominem facilius suffocaret, ne vi interemptus videretur</span>. And, perhaps, as Thenius supposes, the crown was offered to Hazael as a successful warrior. (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/10-32.htm" title="In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;">2Kings 10:32</a>, seq.) When Duncker (Hist. of Antiq., 1:413) ventures to state that Elisha incited Hazael to the murder of Ben-hadad, and afterwards renewed the war against Israel, not without encouragement from the prophet as a persistent enemy of Jehoram and his dynasty, he simply betrays an utter incapacity for understanding the character and function of Hebrew prophecy. The writer of Kings, at all events, did not intend to represent Elisha as a deceiver of foreign sovereigns and a traitor to his own; and this narrative is the only surviving record of the events described.<p><span class= "bld">Hazael reigned in his stead.</span>--On the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser II. (B.C. 860-825), now in the British Museum, we read: "In my 18th regnal year for the 16th time I crossed the Euphrates. Haza'ilu of the land of Damascus came on to the battle: 1,121 of his chariots, 470 of his horsemen, with his stores, I took from him." And again: "In my 21st year for the 21st time I crossed the Euphrates: to the cities of Haza'ilu of the land of Damascus I marched, whose towns I took. Tribute of the land of the Tyrians, Sidonians, Giblites, I received."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth.</span> <span class="accented">Macber</span> is a cloth of a coarse texture - a mat, or piece of carpeting. It has here the article prefixed to it (<span class="accented">ham-macber</span>), which implies that there was but one in the sick-room. We may conjecture that it was a mat used as a sort of pillow, and interposed between the head-rest (so common in Egypt and Assyria) and the head (compare the <span class="accented">c'bir</span> of <a href="/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And dipped it in water.</span> The water would fill up the interstices through which air might otherwise have been drawn, and hasten the suffocation. A death of the same kind is recorded in the Persian history entitled 'Kholasat el Akhbar,' which contains (p. 162) the following passage: "The malik ordered that they should place a carpet on Abdallah's mouth, so that his life was cut off." <span class="cmt_word">And spread it on his face, so that he died.</span> It has been supposed by some commentators, as Luther, Schultz, Geddes, Boothroyd, that Benhadad put the wet <span class="accented">macber</span> on his own face for refreshment, and accidentally suffocated himself; but this is very unlikely, and it is certainly not the natural sense of the words. As "Hazael" is the subject of "departed" and "came" and "answered" in ver. 14, so it is the natural subject of "took" and "dipped" and "spread" in ver. 15. Ver. 11 also would be unintelligible if Hazael entertained no murderous intentions. Why Ewald ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 93, Eng. trans.) introduces a "bath-servant," unmentioned in the text, to murder Benhadad for no assignable reason, it is difficult to conjecture. <span class="cmt_word">And Hazael reigned in his stead.</span> The direct succession of Hazael to Benhadad is confirmed by the inscription on the Black Obelisk, where he appears as King of Damascus (line 97) a few years only after Benhadad (<span class="accented">Bin-idri</span>) had been mentioned as king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/8-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
