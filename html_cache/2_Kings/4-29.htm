Gehazi is his servant, often accompanying him in his ministry. This relationship mirrors that of Elijah and Elisha, highlighting the importance of mentorship and service in prophetic ministry.<p><b>Tie up your garment</b><br>This phrase refers to the practice of girding up one's loins, a common action in ancient Near Eastern culture to prepare for swift movement or work. It signifies readiness and urgency, indicating the importance of the task Gehazi is about to undertake.<p><b>Take my staff in your hand</b><br>The staff is a symbol of authority and power, often associated with leadership and divine intervention. In biblical narratives, staffs are used by figures like Moses to perform miracles, suggesting that Elisha's staff carries spiritual significance.<p><b>And go!</b><br>The command to go emphasizes the immediacy and importance of the mission. It reflects the urgency of the situation, as the boy's life is at stake, and underscores the need for prompt obedience in carrying out God's work.<p><b>If you meet anyone, do not greet him</b><br>In ancient Israel, greetings were often lengthy and involved, which could delay Gehazi's mission. This instruction highlights the priority of the task over social customs, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation.<p><b>And if anyone greets you, do not answer him</b><br>This further underscores the urgency and focus required for Gehazi's mission. It suggests that nothing should distract him from his purpose, reflecting a single-minded dedication to God's work.<p><b>Then lay my staff on the boy&#8217;s face</b><br>This action is symbolic, representing the transfer of divine power and authority. It parallels other biblical instances where physical objects are used as conduits for God's power, such as the hem of Jesus' garment in the New Testament. The act foreshadows the resurrection power of Christ, who brings life to the dead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A

A short greeting might end in a long halt. "Orientals lose much time in tedious salutations" (<span class= "ital">Keil</span>).<p><span class= "bld">Lay my staff upon the face of the child.</span>--It seems to be implied that if the mother had had faith this would have sufficed for raising the child. (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/2-8.htm" title="And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided here and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.">2Kings 2:8</a>; <a href="/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>.) Keil supposes that the prophet foresaw the failure of this expedient, and intended by it to teach the Shunammitess and his followers generally that the power of working miracles was not <span class= "ital">magically</span> inherent in himself or in his staff, as they might imagine, but only in Jehovah, who granted the temporary use of that power to faith and prayer. In other words, Elisha was seeking to lift the minds of his disciples to higher and more spiritual conceptions of the prophetic office. But this seems doubtful.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Than he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again.</span> The object of all these injunctions is haste. Lose not a moment. Go as quickly as thou canst to the house where the child lies. Spend no time in greetings on the way. Slack not. <span class="cmt_word">Tarry not. And lay my staff upon the face of the child.</span> What effect the prophet expected from this act, we are not told. Gehazi appears to have expected that it would at once cause a resuscitation (ver. 31); but there is no evidence that the prophet participated in the expectation. He may have done so, for prophets are not infallible beyond the sphere of the revelations made to them; but he may only have intended to comfort and cheer the mother, and to raise in her an expectation of the resuscitation which he trusted it would be allowed him to effect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/4-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Elisha said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
