Gold and silver were not only symbols of wealth but also of power and divine favor. The taking of these metals signifies a transfer of power and a humiliation of the defeated party. In biblical history, such acts often indicated God's judgment on a nation for its disobedience.<p><b>and all the articles found in the house of the LORD</b><br>The house of the LORD refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a sacred place for the Israelites. The articles within were used for worship and sacrifices, making their seizure a profound desecration. This act echoes previous instances where the temple was plundered, such as during the reign of Rehoboam (<a href="/1_kings/14-25.htm">1 Kings 14:25-26</a>), highlighting a recurring theme of Israel's vulnerability due to its spiritual infidelity.<p><b>and in the treasuries of the royal palace</b><br>The royal palace's treasuries contained the wealth accumulated by the kings of Judah. The loss of these treasures not only weakened the kingdom economically but also symbolized the loss of royal authority and prestige. This event is reminiscent of the Babylonian exile when the treasures of both the temple and the palace were taken to Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13-17</a>).<p><b>as well as some hostages</b><br>Taking hostages was a strategic move to ensure compliance and prevent rebellion. Hostages were often members of the royal family or nobility, whose safety would guarantee the subjugated nation's cooperation. This practice underscores the political dynamics of the time, where alliances and vassalage were maintained through such means.<p><b>Then he returned to Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The return to Samaria signifies the completion of a successful campaign and the consolidation of power. This event reflects the ongoing conflict between the Northern and Southern Kingdoms, illustrating the divided state of Israel and Judah. The return also marks a temporary shift in power dynamics, with Israel asserting dominance over Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoash.htm">Jehoash (Joash) of Israel</a></b><br>The king of Israel who invaded Judah and took treasures from the temple and the royal palace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah_of_judah.htm">Amaziah of Judah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who was defeated by Jehoash, leading to the plundering of Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, where the temple and royal palace were located.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>The temple in Jerusalem, a sacred place for worship and the dwelling of God's presence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, where Jehoash returned after the plundering.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_pride_and_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Pride and Disobedience</a></b><br>Amaziah's pride and disobedience led to his defeat and the loss of Judah's treasures.

This fulfilled the pattern God warned of in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-47.htm">Deuteronomy 28:47&#8211;48</a>, where national pride and disobedience lead to loss of wealth.<p>&#8226; Similar plunderings had happened before: Shishak of Egypt in Rehoboam&#8217;s day (<a href="/1_kings/14-25.htm">1 Kings 14:25-26</a>) and Hazael of Aram pressuring Jehoash of Judah (<a href="/2_kings/12-17.htm">2 Kings 12:17-18</a>). Each time, treasure went because hearts drifted from the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the articles found in the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; These &#8220;articles&#8221; were vessels dedicated for worship&#8212;items set apart for sacrifices, incense, and daily temple service (cf. <a href="/exodus/25-29.htm">Exodus 25:29-30</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehoash&#8217;s seizure desecrated what was holy (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-23.htm">2 Chronicles 25:23-24</a>, the parallel account). Israel&#8217;s northern king had no qualms about robbing the very temple where God chose to place His Name (<a href="/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The incident previews later judgments: Nebuchadnezzar taking temple vessels to Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13-17</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>). Every loss underscores that sacred objects cannot guarantee protection when covenant faithfulness is lacking.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in the treasuries of the royal palace</b><p>&#8226; Jehoash went beyond temple wealth, emptying Amaziah&#8217;s personal and governmental storehouses. Judah&#8217;s king paid dearly for picking a fight he could not win (<a href="/2_kings/14-8.htm">2 Kings 14:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Repeatedly, Judah&#8217;s kings had treated God-given resources as bargaining chips&#8212;Asa sent palace and temple silver to Ben-hadad (<a href="/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), Hezekiah later stripped gold from temple doors to placate Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15-16</a>). Such patterns illustrate <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>: &#8220;He who trusts in his riches will fall.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as well as some hostages</b><p>&#8226; Taking hostages secured Judah&#8217;s ongoing submission. This was a common ancient Near Eastern tactic (<a href="/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The loss was not merely monetary; families in Jerusalem felt the sting of loved ones carried north. Sin&#8217;s consequences are personal and communal (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1, 5</a>).<p>&#8226; Amaziah&#8217;s pride (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-19.htm">2 Chronicles 25:19</a>) cost his people their freedom. God&#8217;s Word consistently ties a leader&#8217;s spiritual state to national welfare (<a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then he returned to Samaria</b><p>&#8226; Jehoash withdrew to his capital without occupying Jerusalem. The act shows he sought humiliation, not annexation.<p>&#8226; Samaria&#8217;s apparent triumph was fleeting; within a few decades the city would itself fall to Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5-6</a>) because Israel, like Judah, ignored the prophets&#8217; calls to repentance (<a href="/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; God allowed Jehoash this victory as discipline for Amaziah, yet He remained sovereign over both kingdoms, advancing His larger redemptive plan (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/14-14.htm">2 Kings 14:14</a> records Jehoash&#8217;s thorough plundering of Jerusalem after Judah&#8217;s king arrogantly provoked war. The verse highlights how God permits material loss, desecration of sacred things, political humiliation, and personal suffering when His people choose pride over obedience. Wealth, symbols, and power cannot shield a nation that drifts from the Lord. The incident stands as a sober reminder: true security rests not in treasures or strategies but in humble, covenant-faithful reliance on God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">That were found.</span>--This expression seems to hint that there was not much treasure to carry off.
