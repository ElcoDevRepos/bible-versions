The "evil" refers to actions contrary to God's commandments, often involving idolatry and injustice. In the context of the Kings of Israel, this typically involved the worship of false gods, which was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" underscores God's omniscience and His role as the ultimate judge of human actions.<p><b>and did not turn away from all the sins</b><br>This highlights the king's persistence in sinful behavior, showing a lack of repentance or reform. The concept of turning away is significant in biblical theology, often associated with repentance and returning to God (<a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>). The failure to turn away from sin suggests a hardened heart and a refusal to heed prophetic warnings, which were common during the reigns of the kings of Israel.<p><b>that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit</b><br>Jeroboam son of Nebat was the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy. His reign is marked by the establishment of golden calves at Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>), which led Israel into idolatry. This act was a significant departure from the worship of Yahweh in Jerusalem and set a precedent for subsequent kings. The reference to Jeroboam's sins serves as a historical benchmark for idolatry and apostasy in Israel, illustrating the long-lasting impact of a leader's actions on a nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam_ii.htm">Jeroboam II</a></b><br>The king of Israel during the time of this verse.
