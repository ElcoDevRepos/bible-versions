Historically, the "people of the land" often played a significant role in political events, as seen in other instances such as the crowning of Joash (<a href="/2_kings/11-14.htm">2 Kings 11:14</a>). Their involvement indicates a collective action or consensus among the populace, reflecting their dissatisfaction with the conspirators' actions.<p><b>killed all those who had conspired against King Amon</b><br>King Amon was assassinated by his own servants, as detailed earlier in <a href="/2_kings/21-23.htm">2 Kings 21:23</a>. The killing of the conspirators by the people suggests a rejection of the coup and a desire to restore order and legitimacy to the throne. This act of retribution aligns with the biblical principle of justice, as seen in <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, where the shedding of blood requires accountability. It also reflects the cultural and legal norms of the time, where blood vengeance was a common practice.<p><b>and they made his son Josiah king in his place</b><br>Josiah, Amon's son, was made king by the people, indicating their support for the Davidic line and the continuation of the legitimate royal lineage. Josiah's ascension to the throne is significant in biblical history, as he later becomes one of Judah's most righteous kings, known for his reforms and dedication to the worship of Yahweh (2 Kings 22-23). This event fulfills the promise of a Davidic dynasty, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>, and foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_the_land.htm">The People of the Land</a></b><br>This term refers to the common people or inhabitants of Judah who took action against the conspirators.
