His role as a prophet is to convey God's messages to the people and the kings. This phrase indicates that Elisha is about to deliver a significant message, emphasizing his authority as a prophet.<p><b>&#8220;As surely as the LORD of Hosts lives,</b><br>The "LORD of Hosts" is a title that emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly and earthly armies. This phrase underscores the certainty and seriousness of Elisha's statement, invoking the living God as a witness to his words. It reflects the deep faith and reverence Elisha has for God, aligning with similar affirmations found in <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a> and <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>.<p><b>before whom I stand,</b><br>This phrase indicates Elisha's position as a servant and representative of God. Standing before the LORD implies a close relationship and accountability to God, similar to the role of a court official before a king. It echoes the language used by Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>, highlighting the continuity of prophetic ministry.<p><b>were it not for my regard for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah,</b><br>Jehoshaphat was a king known for his faithfulness to God, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-6</a>. Elisha's respect for Jehoshaphat suggests that the king's righteousness influences God's favor. This highlights the biblical principle that God often blesses or spares others for the sake of the righteous, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18-26.htm">Genesis 18:26-32</a> with Abraham's intercession for Sodom.<p><b>I would not look at you or acknowledge you.</b><br>Elisha's statement is directed at the king of Israel, likely Joram, who did not follow the ways of the LORD. This reflects the tension between the prophets and the often unfaithful kings of Israel. Elisha's refusal to acknowledge Joram without Jehoshaphat's presence underscores the importance of righteousness and God's disfavor towards idolatry and disobedience, as seen throughout the narratives of the kings in 1 and 2 Kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God, successor to Elijah, known for his

authority, echoing how Elijah confronted kings (<a href="/1_kings/18-17.htm">1 Kings 18:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s word, not political strategy, is the decisive factor (<a

Gabriel&#8217;s words to Zechariah, it conveys proximity to divine authority (<a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Elisha&#8217;s fearless stance contrasts sharply with the moral

href="/2_kings/3-14.htm">2 Kings 3:14</a> teaches that the living LORD alone commands history, that His servants speak with His full authority, and that righteous leadership invites divine favor even in complicated alliances. God&#8217;s holiness distances Him from willful sin, yet He graciously acts for the sake of those who genuinely seek Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Before whom I stand.</span>--As a minister.

Jehoshaphat is accepted because of his faithful dependence on Jehovah (<a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm" title="But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.">2Kings 3:11</a>). Jehoram still maintained or tolerated the cultus of Bethel and Dan.

Even now he was engaged in an expedition which had received no Divine sanction, and was allied with two idolatrous monarchs. But Elisha condones these derelictions of duty in consideration of the king's honesty of purpose and steady attachment to Jehovah, which is witnessed to by the authors both of Kings (<a href="/1_kings/22-43.htm">1 Kings 22:43</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>) and Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/19-4.htm">2 Chronicles 19:4-11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-5.htm">2 Chronicles 20:5-21</a>, etc.). He "regards the presence of Jehoshaphat," and therefore consents to return an answer to the three kings, and announce to them the mode of their deliverance. The adjuration wherewith he opens his speech is one of great solemnity, only used upon very special occasions (see <a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-16.htm">2 Kings 5:16</a>), and adds great force to his declaration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/3-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Elisha</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1431;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_477.htm">Strong's 477: </a> </span><span class="str2">Elisha -- 'God is salvation', a well-known Israelite prophet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
