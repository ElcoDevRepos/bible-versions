The "keeper of the wardrobe" likely refers to an official responsible for maintaining ceremonial garments, possibly within a temple context. This role indicates the organized nature of Baal worship, which had its own priestly class and rituals. Jehu's command to this official shows his authority and strategic approach in dealing with the idolatrous practices.<p><b>Bring out garments for all the servants of Baal</b><br>The garments were likely ceremonial robes worn by the priests and worshippers of Baal during religious rituals. By asking for these garments, Jehu is setting a trap, as these garments would identify the worshippers of Baal, making it easier to distinguish them from the followers of Yahweh. This act is part of Jehu's broader campaign to fulfill the prophecy given to Elijah about the destruction of Ahab's house and the eradication of Baal worship (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16-17</a>).<p><b>So he brought out garments for them</b><br>The keeper complies with Jehu's request, indicating either his ignorance of Jehu's intentions or his submission to the king's authority. This action sets the stage for Jehu's subsequent massacre of the Baal worshippers, as described later in the chapter. The event underscores the theme of divine judgment against idolatry, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. It also highlights the fulfillment of God's word through His prophets, as Jehu's actions align with the divine mandate to cleanse Israel of idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was anointed to destroy the house of Ahab and eradicate Baal worship from Israel.
