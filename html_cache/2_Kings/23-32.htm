The "evil" refers to actions contrary to God's commandments, often involving idolatry and injustice. In the context of 2 Kings, this typically includes the worship of foreign gods and neglect of the covenant with Yahweh. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" underscores God's omniscience and the accountability of leaders to divine standards, not merely human ones.<p><b>just as his fathers had done</b><br>This highlights the continuity of sin and disobedience across generations, suggesting a pattern of behavior that was not corrected. It reflects the influence of familial and cultural traditions in shaping one's actions, often leading to the perpetuation of idolatry and rebellion against God. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the consequences of failing to break away from sinful legacies, as seen in the history of Israel and Judah. The reference to "fathers" connects to the broader biblical theme of generational sin and the need for repentance and reform, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, which speaks of the iniquity of the fathers affecting subsequent generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoahaz.htm">Jehoahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned for a short period.
