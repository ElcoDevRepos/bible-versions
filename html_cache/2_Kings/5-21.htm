This pursuit marks a significant departure from the integrity expected of a prophet's servant. Gehazi's actions contrast with Elisha's earlier refusal of Naaman's gifts, highlighting a moral and spiritual decline. The pursuit itself is symbolic of Gehazi's internal chase after material wealth, which ultimately leads to his downfall. This moment foreshadows the consequences of covetousness, as seen in other biblical narratives such as Achan's sin in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>.<p><b>And when Naaman saw him running toward him,</b><br>Naaman, a Syrian commander, had just experienced a miraculous healing from leprosy after following Elisha's instructions to wash in the Jordan River. His willingness to stop and engage with Gehazi reflects his gratitude and respect for the prophet's household. The act of running indicates urgency, which may have led Naaman to believe there was an important message or need. This scene underscores the cultural importance of hospitality and communication in ancient Near Eastern societies.<p><b>he got down from the chariot to meet him</b><br>Naaman's descent from the chariot is a gesture of respect and humility, especially significant given his high status. In the ancient world, chariots were symbols of power and prestige, and stepping down from one to meet someone on foot demonstrated a willingness to engage on equal terms. This act can be seen as a continuation of Naaman's transformation, not just physically but spiritually, as he had acknowledged the God of Israel after his healing.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;Is everything all right?&#8221;</b><br>Naaman's inquiry reflects concern and a readiness to assist, indicating a change in his character post-healing. This question is a common greeting in the biblical text, often used to express genuine interest in another's well-being. It also sets the stage for Gehazi's deceitful response, contrasting Naaman's sincerity with Gehazi's duplicity. The question echoes the biblical theme of seeking peace and well-being, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>, where seeking the peace of the city is encouraged.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gehazi.htm">Gehazi</a></b><br>The servant of Elisha, the prophet.

Thus Gehazi, if he went at his best speed, could expect to overtake, and did actually overtake, the cavalcade of Naaman. He probably overtook them at a very short distance from Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And when Naaman saw him running after him.</span> Gehazi was pressed for time. He could not start at once, lest he should make it too plain that he was going m pursuit of Naaman; and he could not absent himself from the house too long, lest his master should call for him. He had, therefore, at whatever loss of dignity, to hurry himself, and actually "run after" the Syrian. Naaman, either accidentally looking back, or warned by some of his train, sees him, recognizes him, and is only too glad to respond to his wishes. <span class="cmt_word">He lighted down from the chariot to meet him.</span> An act of great condescension. As Bahr notes, "Descent from a vehicle is, in the East, a sign of respect from the inferior to the superior;" and Naaman, in lighting down from his chariot, must have intended to "honor the prophet in his servant" ('Commentary on Kings,' vol. 2. p. 55). But such honor is not commonly paid, and thus the act of Naaman was abnormal. <span class="cmt_word">And said, Is all well?</span> The words admit of no better translation.
