His question reflects the cultural and religious practices of ancient Israel, where visits to prophets were often reserved for special occasions or times of need. The husband&#8217;s inquiry suggests that he does not perceive an immediate crisis, highlighting his lack of awareness of the situation. This phrase underscores the societal norms of seeking prophetic counsel during specific times, indicating the importance of prophets in spiritual and communal life.<p><b>&#8220;It is not a New Moon or a Sabbath.&#8221;</b><br>The New Moon and the Sabbath were significant times for worship and religious observance in Israel. The New Moon marked the beginning of the month and was a time for offerings and seeking divine guidance (<a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>). The Sabbath was a weekly day of rest and worship, as commanded in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). The husband&#8217;s statement implies that these were customary times for visiting a prophet, suggesting that the Shunammite woman&#8217;s visit on an ordinary day was unusual. This highlights the urgency and gravity of her situation, as she seeks Elisha&#8217;s help outside the regular religious calendar.<p><b>&#8220;Everything is all right,&#8221; she said.</b><br>The Shunammite woman&#8217;s response is a statement of faith and determination. Despite her son&#8217;s death, she chooses not to disclose the tragedy to her husband at this moment. Her words can be seen as an expression of trust in God and the prophet Elisha, whom she believes can restore her son. This phrase reflects a theme of faith and hope in the face of adversity, a common motif in biblical narratives. It also foreshadows the miraculous intervention that follows, drawing a parallel to the faith demonstrated by other biblical figures who trusted in God&#8217;s power to overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shunammite_woman.htm">The Shunammite Woman</a></b><br>A notable woman from Shunem who showed great faith and hospitality.

Compare the yearly trips of Elkanah&#8217;s family to Shiloh (<a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3, 7</a>).<p>&#8226; The husband assumes nothing urgent could have happened; their son had been in the field that morning (<a href="/2_kings/4-18.htm">2 Kings 4:18</a>).<p>&#8226; His question shows that, in his mind, prophetic ministry was more about set occasions than about an ever-present divine help. <a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a> corrects that assumption: &#8220;God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in times of trouble&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It is not a New Moon or a Sabbath.</b><p>Old-covenant Israel marked time with rhythms that fostered worship and teaching.<p>&#8226; New Moon: the first day of each month, set aside for burnt offerings and trumpet blasts (<a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11&#8211;15</a>). Prophets often taught on these days (<a href="/ezekiel/46-3.htm">Ezekiel 46:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Sabbath: the weekly day of rest and gathering for instruction (<a href="/leviticus/23-3.htm">Leviticus 23:3</a>). <a href="/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a> shows merchants impatiently waiting for the Sabbath and New Moon to end so business could resume&#8212;evidence that these days curtailed normal activity.<p>&#8226; By mentioning both, the husband lumps them together as the only obvious times to seek spiritual counsel. Yet God&#8217;s mercy is not restricted to the calendar; He responds whenever His people call (<a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Everything is all right.</b><p>The Hebrew word behind this reply is shalom&#8212;&#8220;peace, wholeness.&#8221;<p>&#8226; She is not hiding the crisis; she is declaring trust. Her son lies dead (<a href="/2_kings/4-20.htm">2 Kings 4:20</a>), yet she speaks the language of faith, much like Abraham who was &#8220;fully convinced that God was able to do what He had promised&#8221; (<a href="/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a>).<p>&#8226; She reserves the full story for Elisha, the one through whom God had given the child (<a href="/2_kings/4-16.htm">2 Kings 4:16</a>). Faith often speaks before sight, as seen in the woman with the flow of blood&#8212;&#8220;If I just touch His cloak, I will be healed&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/9-21.htm">Matthew 9:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Her words anticipate the miracle. When Gehazi later asks, she repeats, &#8220;Everything is all right&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/4-26.htm">2 Kings 4:26</a>), keeping her focus on God&#8217;s power rather than on the problem.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a> captures a clash between routine religion and bold, personal faith. The husband thinks divine help is tied to scheduled holy days, but his wife knows that the living God can intervene at any moment. Her confident &#8220;Everything is all right&#8221; sets the stage for the resurrection of her son and reminds readers that faith speaks peace in the face of death, trusting the Lord who is always accessible and always able.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Wiltt thou go.</span>--<span class= "ital">Art thou going</span>. Archaic forms of the pronoun and participle are here used.<p><span class= "bld">It is neither new moon, nor sabbath.</span>--Comp. <a href="/amos/8-5.htm" title="Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?">Amos 8:5</a>. This remark is interesting, because it implies that the faithful in the northern kingdom were wont to visit prophets on these holy days for the sake of religious instruction and edification. Thenius suggests a doubt whether the later practice of resorting to the Scribes on these days has not here been transferred by an anachronism to the days of Elisha. (Comp. <a href="/numbers/18-11.htm" title="And this is yours; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.">Numbers 18:11</a> <span class= "ital">seq</span>.; <a href="/leviticus/23-3.htm" title="Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; you shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:3</a>, for the legal mode of observing new moons and Sabbath days.)<p><span class= "bld">It shall be well.</span>--Omit <span class= "ital">it shall be</span>.

It was not either "new moon" or "sabbath" - times when evidently the prophets conducted services, which were attended by pious persons from the neighborhood: what could she want of Elisha? He had evidently no idea that the child was dead. Probably he had not realized to himself that he was in any danger. <span class="cmt_word">And she said, It shall be well.</span> She uttered the single word <span class="accented">shalom</span>, literally, "peace," but used, like the German <span class="accented">gut</span>, or the English "all right," to content an inquirer without giving him a definite answer.
