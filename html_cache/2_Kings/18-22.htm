The Assyrians were known for their military prowess and psychological warfare, often attempting to undermine the confidence of their enemies. The Rabshakeh challenges the faith of the Israelites, questioning their reliance on God. This reflects a common biblical theme where faith is tested in the face of overwhelming odds, similar to the challenges faced by figures like David against Goliath (1 Samuel 17).<p><b>is He not the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed,</b><br>Hezekiah's religious reforms included the removal of high places and altars throughout Judah (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>). These high places were often associated with idolatrous practices, even though some were used for worshiping Yahweh. The Rabshakeh's statement reveals a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of Hezekiah's reforms, suggesting that removing these sites was an affront to God. In reality, Hezekiah's actions were in obedience to God's command to centralize worship in Jerusalem, aligning with <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>.<p><b>saying to Judah and Jerusalem:</b><br>Hezekiah's reforms were directed at both the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, emphasizing the importance of unified worship.

This centralization of worship was a fulfillment of God's instructions in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>, where God chose Jerusalem as the place for His name to dwell. The Rabshakeh's challenge highlights the tension between political power and religious obedience, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.

He portrays obedience as offense, hoping to sever the people&#8217;s trust. Yet the verse highlights the very opposite: true reliance on God stands firm when worldly voices misinterpret righteousness. Hezekiah&#8217;s removal of high places was obedience, not apostasy, and worship at the Jerusalem altar aligned Judah with God&#8217;s revealed will.

(<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm" title="He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for to those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.">2Kings 18:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/31-1.htm" title="Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.">2Chronicles 31:1</a>.) The Assyrians would appear to have heard of Hezekiah's reformation, As he was a vassal of the great king, no doubt his proceedings were watched with jealous interest.<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall worship . . . in Jerusalem?</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Before this altar shall ye worship, at Jerusalem.</span> The great altar of burnt offering was to be the <span class= "ital">one</span> altar, and Jerusalem the <span class= "ital">one</span> city, where Jehovah might be worshipped.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if ye say unto me, We trust in the Lord our God.</span> Sennacherib had also heard of this second ground of trust, which Hezekiah had certainly put forward with great openness (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-8.htm">2 Chronicles 32:8</a>). No doubt he thought it purely fantastical and illusory. But he was not unaware that it might inspire a determined resistance. He therefore condescended to argue against reliance on it. <span class="cmt_word">Is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away?</span> His counselors have suggested to Sennacherib a specious argument - How can Hezekiah confidently rely on the protection of the God of the land, Jehovah, when he has been employing himself for years in the destruction of this very God's high places and altars? Surely the God will not favor one who has been pulling down his places of worship! Putting out of sight the special requirements of the Jewish Law, the argument might well seem unanswerable. At any rate, it was calculated to have a certain effect on the minds of those who were attached to the high-place worship, and desired its continuance. <span class="cmt_word">And hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem.</span> A weak argument, if addressed to Jews of Jerusalem only, but likely to have weight with the country Jews, if, as is probable, they had crowded into the city when the invasion began. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/18-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
