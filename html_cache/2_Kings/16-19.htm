His reign is noted for its significant departure from the religious practices of his predecessors. Ahaz is often criticized for his idolatry and for leading Judah into practices that were contrary to the worship of Yahweh. His acts include making alliances with foreign powers, such as Assyria, which had long-term negative consequences for Judah. This phrase suggests that there were many other actions and decisions made by Ahaz that are not detailed in this particular biblical account.<p><b>along with his accomplishments</b><br>Despite his negative portrayal, Ahaz did have accomplishments, though they are often viewed through the lens of his failures. He is known for his political maneuvers, such as seeking the aid of Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria to fend off threats from Israel and Aram. However, these accomplishments are overshadowed by his religious reforms, which included the introduction of Assyrian religious practices and the alteration of the temple in Jerusalem. These actions are seen as leading Judah further away from the covenant with God.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><br>This phrase refers to a historical record that is no longer extant but was likely a detailed account of the reigns of the kings of Judah. The Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah is distinct from the biblical books of Chronicles and served as a source for the authors of Kings. This reference underscores the historical nature of the biblical narrative, suggesting that the events of Ahaz's reign were well-documented and known to the original audience. It also implies that the biblical account is selective, focusing on theological and moral lessons rather than exhaustive historical detail.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>King of Judah, known for his unfaithfulness to God and for leading Judah into idolatry.

The verse encourages us to read the surrounding chapters (<a href="/bsb/2_kings/16.htm">2 Kings 16</a>; 2 Chron 28) for a fuller picture, to trust Scripture&#8217;s precision, and to remember that our own actions, like Ahaz&#8217;s, are fully seen by God and will be weighed in His perfect record.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Which he did.</span>--Some MSS., and the LXX., Syriac, and Arabic have the usual formula, "and all which he did."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19, 20.</span> - The <span class="accented">death of Ahaz</span>.
