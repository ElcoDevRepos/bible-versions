Assyria was a dominant empire known for its military prowess and expansionist policies. The Assyrian Empire, located in what is now northern Iraq, was a significant power in the ancient Near East. Shalmaneser's attack on Israel was part of Assyria's broader strategy to control the region. This event marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history, leading to the eventual fall of Samaria and the northern kingdom. The Assyrian policy of deportation and resettlement was a tool to prevent rebellion and assimilate conquered peoples, which would later be seen in the exile of the Israelites.<p><b>and Hoshea became his vassal</b><br>Hoshea was the last king of Israel, reigning from approximately 732 to 722 BC. Becoming a vassal meant that Hoshea was subject to Assyrian authority, required to pay tribute, and had limited autonomy. This vassalage was a common practice in the ancient Near East, where weaker states would submit to stronger empires to avoid destruction. Hoshea's submission to Assyria was a political move to maintain his throne and the survival of his kingdom, albeit temporarily. This situation reflects the broader theme of Israel's reliance on foreign powers rather than trusting in God, a recurring issue highlighted by the prophets.<p><b>and paid him tribute</b><br>Paying tribute involved giving a regular payment of goods, money, or resources to a superior power as a sign of submission and to ensure protection. For Israel, this tribute was likely a heavy burden, straining the nation's resources and economy. The payment of tribute is mentioned in other biblical contexts, such as in <a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19-20</a>, where Menahem paid tribute to Pul, king of Assyria. This act of tribute underscores the political and economic pressures faced by Israel and serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's covenant. The prophets often warned against alliances with foreign nations, urging reliance on God instead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shalmaneser.htm">Shalmaneser</a></b><br>The king of Assyria who attacked Israel.

The name immediately signals to readers that Israel, the northern kingdom, is now facing the dominant world power of the day. Earlier kings had already felt Assyria&#8217;s pressure (<a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19&#8211;20</a>; 16:7&#8211;9). By the time Shalmaneser marches, decades of prophetic warnings&#8212;think <a href="/amos/3-11.htm">Amos 3:11</a> or <a href="/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a>&#8212;are coming to a head. God has not lost control; rather, He is actively directing history, using a pagan ruler to discipline His covenant people just as the Law had forewarned (<a href="/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>attacked him</b><p>&#8220;Him&#8221; points back to Hoshea, Israel&#8217;s final king (<a href="/2_kings/17-1.htm">2 Kings 17:1</a>).

Scripture repeatedly ties Assyrian aggression to Israel&#8217;s persistent sin:<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7&#8211;17</a> catalogs the nation&#8217;s idolatry, closing with, &#8220;Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and He removed them from His presence&#8221; (v.18).<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-47.htm">Deuteronomy 28:47&#8211;52</a> had predicted that disobedience would bring &#8220;a nation from far away&#8221; that would &#8220;besiege all the cities.&#8221;<p>The attack is the outworking of covenant consequences. God&#8217;s Word proves true in real time&#8212;historically, militarily, and spiritually.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hoshea became his vassal</b><p>Hoshea&#8217;s submission signals the end of Israel&#8217;s independence. A vassal king must pledge loyalty, keep the peace, and often hand over hostages (cf. <a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13&#8211;14</a> where Hezekiah faces similar terms). Notice the shift:<p>&#8226; Hoshea once plotted against Pekah to seize the throne (<a href="/2_kings/15-30.htm">2 Kings 15:30</a>), but now he himself is forced to bow.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a> reminds us, &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is in the hand of the LORD&#8221;; Hoshea&#8217;s political maneuvering cannot override divine sovereignty.<p>Becoming a vassal exposes the emptiness of trusting alliances and power plays instead of the LORD (<a href="/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and paid him tribute</b><p>Tribute is more than a money transfer; it is a symbol of ownership. Hoshea&#8217;s annual payments (<a href="/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a> hints it was &#8220;yearly&#8221;) probably included silver, gold, produce, and manpower. The tribute:<p>&#8226; Drains Israel&#8217;s economy, fulfilling <a href="/deuteronomy/28-43.htm">Deuteronomy 28:43&#8211;44</a>, &#8220;The foreigner among you will rise higher&#8230;you will become the borrower.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Advertises humiliation&#8212;envoys would publicly deliver the payment (<a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a> b, 15).<p>&#8226; Reveals that sin is costly; rejecting God always results in servitude, whether political or spiritual (<a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3</a> records a literal historical moment loaded with spiritual meaning.

This agrees with what Menander states (Josephus, <span class= "ital">Ant. ix.</span> 14, 2), according to whom Shalmaneser made an expedition against Tyre (and no doubt Israel, as the ally of Tyre), which lasted <span class= "ital">five</span> years--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> was continued beyond Shalmaneser's reign into that of Sargon.

It is uncertain whether he was Tiglath-pileser's son or a usurper.
