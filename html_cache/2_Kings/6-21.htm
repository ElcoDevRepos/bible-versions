This event occurs during a period of frequent conflict between Israel and Aram (Syria). The Aramean army, which had been blinded and led to Samaria by Elisha, is now in the presence of the king. This moment highlights the tension and uncertainty in the king's response to the unexpected situation. The king's reaction is significant as it reflects the political and military pressures of the time, as well as the influence of prophetic authority in Israel.<p><b>he asked Elisha</b><br>Elisha, the prophet, holds a position of spiritual authority and influence in Israel. His presence and actions demonstrate the power of God working through His prophets. The king's consultation with Elisha indicates a recognition of the prophet's role as a mediator of God's will. This interaction underscores the importance of seeking divine guidance in matters of state and warfare, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8220;My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?&#8221;</b><br>The term "my father" is a respectful address, acknowledging Elisha's spiritual authority and wisdom. The repetition of the question "Shall I kill them?" emphasizes the king's eagerness or anxiety to act decisively against the captured Arameans. This reflects the cultural and historical context of ancient Near Eastern warfare, where captured enemies were often executed. However, the king's deference to Elisha suggests an awareness of the moral and ethical implications of such an action, as well as the potential for divine instruction to guide his decision. This moment foreshadows the unexpected mercy that Elisha will instruct, aligning with biblical themes of grace and the transformative power of God's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>Likely King Jehoram, son of Ahab, who ruled the northern kingdom of Israel.

Compare the use of the same expression by Joash (<a href="/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>), and the employment of the correlative term "son" (<a href="/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a>) by Berthadad. <span class="cmt_word">Shall I smite them? shall I smite them?</span> The repetition marks extreme eagerness, while the interrogative form shows a certain amount of hesitation. It is certain that the Israelites were in the habit of putting to death their prisoners of war, not only when they were captured with arms in their hands, but even when they surrendered themselves. When a city or country was conquered, the whole male population of full age was commonly put to death (<a href="/numbers/31-7.htm">Numbers 31:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/20-3.htm">1 Chronicles 20:3</a>, etc.). When a third part was spared, it was from some consideration of relationship (<a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>). The Law distinctly allowed, if it did not even enjoin, the practice (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-13.htm">Deuteronomy 20:13</a>). Jehoram, therefore, no doubt, put his prisoners of war to death under ordinary circumstances. But he hesitates now. He feels that the case is an extraordinary one, and that the prophet, who has made the capture, is entitled to be consulted on the subject. Hence his question. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/6-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(kir&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
