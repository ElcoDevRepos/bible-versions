In the ancient Near East, kings often sent envoys to deliver messages, and these envoys were seen as extensions of the king's authority. The taunting of the Lord by Sennacherib's servants reflects a common practice of psychological warfare, intended to demoralize the enemy. This act of defiance against God is reminiscent of other biblical instances where pagan nations underestimated the power of the God of Israel, such as Pharaoh in Exodus.<p><b>and you have said: &#8220;With my many chariots I have ascended to the heights of the mountains,</b><br>Chariots were a symbol of military might and technological advancement in the ancient world. The Assyrians were known for their powerful and well-equipped army, which included a formidable chariotry. The reference to ascending the mountains signifies a boast of military conquest and dominance over difficult terrain, which was often seen as a divine realm. This echoes the pride of other rulers in the Bible who trusted in their military strength, such as Pharaoh in <a href="/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a> and the Canaanite kings in <a href="/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4</a>.<p><b>to the remote peaks of Lebanon.</b><br>Lebanon was renowned for its majestic mountains and valuable cedar trees, which were highly prized in the ancient world for construction and trade. The mention of Lebanon signifies the extent of Assyrian ambition and conquest. The cedars of Lebanon are frequently mentioned in the Bible as symbols of strength and beauty (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>). This phrase underscores the Assyrian king's pride in his ability to reach and conquer even the most distant and revered places.<p><b>I have cut down its tallest cedars, the finest of its cypresses.</b><br>The cutting down of cedars and cypresses symbolizes the destruction and exploitation of natural resources by the Assyrians. In biblical literature, trees often represent nations or leaders (<a href="/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8-15</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22-24</a>). The act of cutting down these trees can be seen as a metaphor for the subjugation of nations and the stripping away of their glory. This imagery also foreshadows the eventual downfall of the Assyrian empire, as pride and defiance against God lead to judgment (<a href="/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33-34</a>).<p><b>I have reached its farthest outposts, the densest of its forests.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the extent of Assyrian expansion and the thoroughness of their conquests. The "farthest outposts" and "densest of its forests" suggest a complete domination over the land, leaving no area untouched. This reflects the historical reality of the Assyrian empire's vast reach and their reputation for ruthlessness. Biblically, it serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over all nations, as even the most powerful empires are ultimately subject to His will (<a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34-35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The king of Assyria, who is boasting about his conquests and power, challenging the God of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, who is the recipient of Sennacherib's threats and seeks God's intervention.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lebanon.htm">Lebanon</a></b><br>A region known for its majestic cedar trees, symbolizing strength and pride, which Sennacherib claims to have conquered.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/messengers.htm">Messengers</a></b><br>The envoys sent by Sennacherib to deliver his blasphemous message to Hezekiah and the people of Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whom Sennacherib has taunted, demonstrating his arrogance and lack of reverence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Sennacherib's boastful claims serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pride.

The chariot-force was the main arm of the Assyrian military service - that on which most dependence was placed, and to which victory was commonly attributed. The number of chariots that could be brought into the field by the Assyrians is nowhere stated; but we find nearly four thousand hostile chariots collected to oppose an ordinary Assyrian invasion, and defeated (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 362, note 8). The estimates of Cterias - eleven thousand for Ninas, and a hundred thousand for Semiramis (Died. Sic., 2:5. &sect; 4) - are, of course, unhistorical. <span class="cmt_word">I am come up to the height of the mountains.</span> "The height of the mountains" is here the high ground which an army would have to traverse in passing from the Coele-Syrian valley into Palestine. It is not exactly Lebanon, which runs parallel with the coast, and certainly does not "guard Palestine to the north," as Keil supposes; But it may be viewed as a "side" or "flank" of Lebanon. In point of fact, Lebanon and Hermon unite their roots to form a barrier between the Coele-Syrian plain (<span class="accented">El Buka'a</span>) and the valley of the Jordan, and an invader from the north must cross this barrier. It is not so difficult or rugged but that the Assyrians could bring their chariots ever it. They were accustomed to traverse far more difficult regions in Zagros and Niphatos and Taurus, and to carry their chariots with them, dismounting when necessary, and having the vehicles lifted over obstacles by human hands (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 74). <span class="cmt_word">To the sides of Lebanon.</span> An army which invades Palestine by the Coele-Syrian valley - quite the easiest and most usual line of invasion - necessarily passes along the entire eastern "side," or "flank," of Lebanon, which is the proper meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, and not "loftiest height" (Keil), or "innermost recess" (Revised Version). The plural, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, is natural when a mountain range, like Lebanon, is spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">And will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof.</span> The felling of timber in the Syrian mountain-chains was a common practice of the Assyrian invaders, and had two quite distinct objects. Sometimes it was mere cruel devastation, done to injure and impoverish the inhabitants; but more often it was done for the sake of the timber which the conqueror carried off into his own country. "The mountains of Amanus I ascended," says Asshur-nazir-pal; "wood for bridges, pines, box, cypress, I cut down... cedar-wood from Amanus I destined for Bit-Hira and my pleasure-house called Azmaku, and for the temple of the moon and sun, the exalted gods. I proceeded to the land of Iz-mehri, and took possession of it throughout: I cut down beams for bridges, and carried them to Nineveh" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 74). The cedar (<span class="accented">erez</span>) and the pine, or juniper (<span class="accented">berosh</span>), were in special request. <span class="cmt_word">And I will enter into the lodgings of his borders -</span> rather, the <span class="accented">lodge of its</span> border - perhaps a palace or hunting-lodge on the outskirt of the Lebanon forest region (comp. <a href="/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and into the forest of his Carmel</span>;
