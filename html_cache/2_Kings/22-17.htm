Throughout the Old Testament, the Israelites often turned away from God, despite His repeated calls for repentance and faithfulness. This forsaking of God is a violation of the first commandment, which emphasizes the exclusivity of worship due to Yahweh alone (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The historical context here is the reign of King Josiah, who was attempting to reform Judah after a period of idolatry under previous kings.<p><b>and burned incense to other gods</b><br>Burning incense was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern religious rituals, symbolizing prayers or offerings to deities. The Israelites' adoption of this practice for other gods indicates syncretism, where they blended the worship of Yahweh with that of Canaanite and other foreign deities. This act was a direct violation of the covenant relationship established at Sinai, where God commanded exclusive worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-14.htm">Deuteronomy 6:14-15</a>).<p><b>that they might provoke Me to anger</b><br>The provocation of God's anger is a significant theme in the prophetic literature. It underscores the personal nature of the relationship between God and His people, where their actions directly affect Him. This anthropomorphic expression of divine anger serves as a warning of impending judgment. The prophets often spoke of God's anger as a response to Israel's covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18-20</a>).<p><b>with all the works of their hands</b><br>This phrase refers to the idols and altars that the people of Judah constructed, which were often made by human hands. The prophets frequently criticized the futility of idol worship, pointing out that these gods were lifeless and powerless (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). The "works of their hands" symbolize human rebellion and the rejection of divine sovereignty.<p><b>My wrath will be kindled against this place</b><br>The "place" refers to Jerusalem and the temple, the center of Jewish worship and identity. God's wrath being kindled indicates an impending judgment, which historically culminated in the Babylonian exile. This phrase serves as a prophetic warning, emphasizing the seriousness of the people's sin and the certainty of divine retribution (<a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8-10</a>).<p><b>and will not be quenched.&#8217;</b><br>The unquenchable nature of God's wrath here suggests the inevitability and completeness of the coming judgment. This is a sobering reminder of the consequences of persistent disobedience. Theologically, it points to the holiness and justice of God, who cannot overlook sin. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and the need for a savior, fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who quenches the wrath of God for those who believe (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_josiah.htm">King Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms after discovering the Book of the Law in the temple.

The verse stands as a sober reminder: wholehearted loyalty to the Lord is non-negotiable, and persistent idolatry inevitably invites His righteous judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">With all the works</span> (work) <span class= "bld">of their hands.</span>--With the idols they have made.

God's threatenings against nations are for the most part conditional, and may be escaped, or at least their fulfillment may be deferred indefinitely, by repentance, as we learn from the example of Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-1.htm">Jonah 3:1-10</a>). But if a nation persists long in evil-doing, there comes a time when the sentence can be no longer averted. A real repentance has become impossible, and a mock one does but provoke God the more. For such a state of things there is "no remedy" (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>), and this was the state of things reached by the Jews. God's anger against them could not be quenched. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/22-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;
