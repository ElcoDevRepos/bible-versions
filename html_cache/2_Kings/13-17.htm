The east direction is significant as it faces Aram (modern-day Syria), the enemy of Israel at the time. This act symbolizes preparation for battle and divine intervention. In biblical symbolism, the east often represents the direction from which God's glory appears (<a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>).<p><b>So he opened it and Elisha said, &#8220;Shoot!&#8221;</b><br>The king obeys Elisha's command, demonstrating faith and submission to God's prophetic word. Shooting an arrow was a common ancient practice to symbolize the commencement of war. This act signifies the beginning of God's deliverance for Israel from their enemies.<p><b>So he shot.</b><br>The king's action of shooting the arrow represents his active participation in God's plan. It is a physical manifestation of faith, similar to other biblical instances where actions accompany faith, such as Moses lifting his staff over the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16</a>).<p><b>And Elisha declared: &#8220;This is the LORD&#8217;s arrow of victory,</b><br>Elisha interprets the act as a prophetic sign. The arrow symbolizes God's promise of victory. The phrase "LORD's arrow" emphasizes that the victory will be divinely orchestrated, not by human might, aligning with passages like <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>, which states that victory comes by God's Spirit.<p><b>the arrow of victory over Aram,</b><br>The specific mention of Aram identifies the immediate enemy. Historically, Aram was a persistent adversary of Israel, often engaging in warfare. This prophecy assures Israel of triumph over a formidable foe, reflecting God's ongoing protection and fulfillment of His covenant promises.<p><b>for you shall strike the Arameans in Aphek</b><br>Aphek was a strategic location in Israel's military history, previously a site of conflict with the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4:1</a>). The prophecy indicates a decisive battle at Aphek, suggesting a complete and significant victory, reminiscent of past deliverances.<p><b>until you have put an end to them.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase promises total victory, implying the complete subjugation of Aram. It reflects God's power to deliver His people fully, as seen in other biblical narratives where God grants overwhelming victory to Israel, such as in the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>). This assurance of victory also prefigures the ultimate triumph of Christ over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor of Elijah, known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoash.htm">Jehoash (Joash) of Israel</a></b><br>The king of Israel during this time, seeking guidance and deliverance from the prophet Elisha.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram (Syria)</a></b><br>A neighboring nation and frequent adversary of Israel, often at war with them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aphek.htm">Aphek</a></b><br>A location where significant battles occurred between Israel and Aram, symbolizing conflict and victory.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_arrow.htm">The Arrow</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's deliverance and victory over Israel's enemies, as directed by the prophet Elisha.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_guidance_and_obedience.htm">Divine Guidance and Obedience</a></b><br>Elisha's instructions to Jehoash highlight the importance of seeking and following God's guidance in our battles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_victory.htm">Symbolism of Victory</a></b><br>The arrow represents God's promise of victory.
