His reign was marked by idolatry and evil practices, following in the footsteps of his father, who had led Judah into sin. Amon's acts are significant as they reflect the continued spiritual decline of Judah during this period. His reign was short, lasting only two years, which suggests that his actions were impactful enough to be noted despite the brevity of his rule.<p><b>along with his accomplishments</b><br>The term "accomplishments" here may refer to both his political and religious actions. Amon's reign did not see significant positive achievements; rather, his accomplishments were largely negative, as he perpetuated the idolatrous practices initiated by Manasseh. This highlights the importance of leadership in guiding the spiritual direction of a nation, a theme consistent throughout the biblical narrative.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><br>This phrase indicates that there was a historical record, now lost, that detailed the reigns of the kings of Judah.

Whatever else Amon did lies in a now-vanished royal record, yet Scripture preserves the only details that ultimately matter: his persistent idolatry and the spiritual consequences that followed. The verse therefore teaches that heaven keeps perfect books, earthly achievements cannot outweigh rebellion, and God&#8217;s Word remains the final, sufficient record for faith and life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the rest of the acts of Amen which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> No other acts of Amen have come down to us.
