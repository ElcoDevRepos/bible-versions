The Abanah (also known as the Barada) and Pharpar are significant rivers in Damascus, known for their clear and abundant waters. This reflects a common human tendency to value what is familiar and esteemed in one's own culture over what is foreign or seemingly inferior. The rivers of Damascus were vital to the region's agriculture and economy, making them highly valued. This comparison highlights Naaman's pride and misunderstanding of God's ways, which often use the humble and unexpected to accomplish His purposes. The Jordan River, though not as impressive, holds significant biblical importance, being the site of Israel's crossing into the Promised Land (Joshua 3) and later, the baptism of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>).<p><b>Could I not have washed in them and been cleansed?&#8221;</b><br>Naaman's question reveals his expectation that healing should come through grand or familiar means, rather than through the simple act of faith and obedience. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God's power is often demonstrated through humble means, such as Moses striking a rock to bring forth water (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>) or Jesus using mud to heal a blind man (<a href="/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6-7</a>). Naaman's focus on the physical attributes of the rivers misses the spiritual lesson of obedience and faith. His statement also underscores a common human struggle with pride and the need for humility to receive God's grace.<p><b>So he turned and went away in a rage.</b><br>Naaman's reaction is one of anger and disappointment, illustrating the struggle between human pride and divine instruction. His rage is a barrier to receiving the healing he seeks, symbolizing how pride can obstruct spiritual growth and blessings. This moment is pivotal, as it sets the stage for Naaman's eventual submission and healing, which occurs only after he humbles himself and follows the prophet Elisha's instructions. This narrative echoes the biblical principle that God's ways are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>) and that humility is essential for receiving God's grace (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). Naaman's initial rejection and subsequent acceptance of God's method of healing serve as a type of conversion experience, foreshadowing the transformative power of faith and obedience in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naaman.htm">Naaman</a></b><br>A commander of the army of the king of Aram, who was a valiant soldier but suffered from leprosy.

True healing flows not from superior resources but from surrendered faith. Naaman&#8217;s initial rage underscores how self-reliance resists grace, while the unfolding narrative will prove that humility and trust open the floodgates of God&#8217;s restoring power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Abana.</span>--So Hebrew text; Hebrew margin, <span class= "ital">Amana</span>; and so many MSS., Complut., LXX., Targum, Syriac.

The principal one is the Barada, probably the Abaua of the present passage, which, rising in the Antilibanus range, and flowing through a series of romantic glens, bursts finally from the mountains through a deep gorge and scatters itself over the plain. One branch passes right through the city of Damascus, cutting it in half. Others flow past the city both on the north and on the south, irrigating the gardens and orchards, and spreading fertility far and wide over the Merj. A small stream, the Fidjeh, flows into the Barada from the north. Another quite independent river, the Awaaj. waters the southern portion of the Damascene plain, but does not approach within several miles of the city. Most geographers regard this as the "Pharpar;" but the identification is uncertain, since the name may very possibly have attached to one of the branches of the Barada. The Barada is limpid, cool, gushing, the perfection of a river: It was known to the Greeks and Romans as the Chrysorrhoas, or "river of gold." We can well understand that Naaman would esteem the streams of his own city as infinitely superior to the turbid, often sluggish, sometimes "clay-colored" (Robinson, ' Researches,' ver. 2. p. 256) Jordan. If leprosy was to be trashed away, it might naturally have appeared to him that the pure Barada would have more cleansing power than the muddy river recommended to him by the prophet. <span class="cmt_word">So he turned and went away in a rage.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/5-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[Are] not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1441;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Abanah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;m&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_71.htm">Strong's 71: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abanah -- a river near Damascus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Pharpar,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1436;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;ar&#183;par)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
