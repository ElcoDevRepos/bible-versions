It stood before the LORD, indicating its role in facilitating the people's approach to God. This altar was a place where offerings were made, signifying the people's devotion and repentance. The act of moving it suggests a significant departure from established worship practices, reflecting King Ahaz's disregard for divine instructions.<p><b>from the front of the temple</b><br>The altar's original position at the front of the temple signified its importance in the sacrificial system. It was strategically placed to be the first point of contact for worshipers entering the temple, emphasizing the necessity of sacrifice before approaching God. This placement was in accordance with divine instructions, highlighting the centrality of sacrifice in maintaining a covenant relationship with God.<p><b>(between the new altar and the house of the LORD)</b><br>The new altar, constructed by King Ahaz, was modeled after an altar he saw in Damascus (<a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10-11</a>). This reflects Ahaz's syncretism, blending pagan practices with Israelite worship. The positioning of the bronze altar between the new altar and the house of the LORD indicates a shift in focus from the divinely ordained practices to those influenced by foreign nations. This act symbolizes a compromise in the purity of worship and a deviation from the covenantal faithfulness expected of Israel.<p><b>and he put it on the north side of the new altar</b><br>Moving the bronze altar to the north side represents a demotion of its significance. The north side was not the prescribed location, indicating a deliberate alteration of worship practices. This action by Ahaz can be seen as a rejection of God's established order, prioritizing human innovation over divine command. It reflects a broader theme in Scripture where deviation from God's instructions leads to spiritual decline. This act foreshadows the eventual downfall of Judah due to persistent unfaithfulness, as prophesied by the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>King of Judah who reigned during a time of spiritual decline.

Each phrase of the verse uncovers layers of compromise: rejecting God&#8217;s precise instructions, minimizing atonement, blending truth with error, and ultimately exalting human schemes over divine revelation. The physical relocation of the altar mirrors a spiritual drift that invites judgment and sorrow&#8212;an enduring warning that true worship must never be redesigned to suit cultural pressures or personal preference, but must remain anchored in the unchanging word and ways of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">And he brought also the brasen altar . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And as for the brasen altar, he brought it near</span> (to the new one), <span class= "ital">away from the front of the house, to wit, from between the</span> (new) <span class= "ital">altar, and the house of Jehovah; and put it at the side of the</span> (new) <span class= "ital">altar northward.</span> The brasen altar used to stand "before the Lord," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in the middle of the court of the priests, and in front of the Temple proper. The verse seems to imply that Urijah had pushed it forward nearer to the sanctuary, and set the new Syrian altar in its place. Ahaz, not satisfied with this arrangement, which appeared to confer a kind of precedence on the old altar, drew it back again, and fixed it on the north side of his new altar.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he brought also the brazen altar, which was before the Lord.</span> One sin leads on to another. Having introduced his self-invented <span class="accented">quasi-idolatrous</span> altar into the temple, and so inserted "the thin end of the wedge," Ahaz was not satisfied, but proceeded to another innovation. Urijah, having had no express order from the king with respect to the position of the new altar, had placed it in front of the old one, between it and the eastern gate of the court. Thus the old altar, which was directly in front of the temple porch, seemed to cut the new altar off from the temple. Ahaz would not have this continue, and resolved on removing the altar of Solomon from, its place, and putting it elsewhere. <span class="cmt_word">From the forefront of the house</span> (comp. <a href="/1_kings/8-54.htm">1 Kings 8:54</a>), <span class="cmt_word">from between the altar</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the new altar - <span class="cmt_word">and the house of the Lord</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> the temple building - <span class="cmt_word">and put it on the north side of the altar.</span> The removal of Solomon's altar from its place of honor to a side position left the space clear between the temple and the new altar, which thus, without exactly occupying the same site, took practically the place of Solomon's altar.
