The "sin" mentioned is primarily idolatry, which violated the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The covenant relationship between God and Israel was based on exclusive worship and obedience. The repeated sinning against God led to divine judgment, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are contingent on Israel's faithfulness.<p><b>who had brought them out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This recalls the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing God's deliverance and faithfulness. The Exodus is frequently referenced throughout the Old Testament as a reminder of God's power and covenantal love (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>). It underscores the gravity of Israel's sin, as they turned away from the God who had miraculously saved them.<p><b>from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt</b><br>Pharaoh represents oppression and bondage, from which God liberated Israel. This liberation is a type of Christ's deliverance of humanity from sin (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>). The historical context of Egyptian dominance highlights the miraculous nature of Israel's escape, emphasizing God's sovereignty over nations and rulers.<p><b>They had worshiped other gods</b><br>This phrase highlights the primary sin of idolatry, which was rampant in the ancient Near East. The worship of Baal and Asherah, among others, was common in Israel despite God's clear commands against it (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-14.htm">Deuteronomy 6:14</a>). This idolatry was not just a religious failure but a breach of the covenant, leading to Israel's downfall. The prophets, such as Hosea and Amos, repeatedly warned against this practice, calling Israel to repentance and faithfulness to Yahweh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt but repeatedly fell into idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_their_god.htm">The LORD their God</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who delivered them from Egypt and commanded their exclusive worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing sin and oppression.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh,_king_of_egypt.htm">Pharaoh, king of Egypt</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt during the time of the Exodus, representing the oppressive forces from which God freed His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/other_gods.htm">Other gods</a></b><br>The false deities that the Israelites turned to, violating their covenant with the LORD and leading to their downfall.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_forgetfulness.htm">The Danger of Forgetfulness</a></b><br>Forgetting God's past deliverance can lead to spiritual decline.
