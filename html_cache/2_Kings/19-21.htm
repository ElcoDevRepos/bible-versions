In the context of <a href="/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19</a>, this word is directed against Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, who has blasphemed God and threatened Jerusalem. The phrase underscores the theme of divine retribution against those who oppose God's people, reflecting the broader biblical narrative where God defends Israel against its enemies (e.g., <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>).<p><b>The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises you and mocks you;</b><br>"Virgin Daughter of Zion" is a poetic term for Jerusalem, symbolizing purity and the city's special status as God's chosen place. The use of "virgin" suggests inviolability, despite the threats from Assyria. The imagery of despising and mocking indicates a reversal of fortunes; the Assyrian king, who once seemed invincible, is now scorned by the very city he sought to conquer. This reflects the biblical theme of God humbling the proud (<a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>).<p><b>the Daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head behind you.</b><br>The "Daughter of Jerusalem" is another personification of the city, emphasizing its identity and relationship with God. Shaking the head is a gesture of derision and disbelief, indicating that the threat posed by Sennacherib is ultimately futile. This act of defiance is rooted in faith in God's deliverance, as seen in other biblical accounts where God intervenes on behalf of His people (e.g., <a href="/psalms/44-7.htm">Psalm 44:7</a>). The imagery also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's kingdom, as seen in prophetic literature (e.g., <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Isaiah to deliver a message of judgment and assurance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virgin_daughter_of_zion.htm">The Virgin Daughter of Zion</a></b><br>A poetic personification of Jerusalem, representing the people of God who are under threat but remain pure and protected by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daughter_of_jerusalem.htm">The Daughter of Jerusalem</a></b><br>Another personification of the city, emphasizing its role as the center of worship and God's chosen dwelling place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The Assyrian king who besieged Jerusalem, representing the forces of evil and opposition against God's people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message, serving as a mediator between God and the people of Judah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>Despite the threats from powerful enemies, God remains in control and protects His people.

It adds great liveliness and force to the opening portion of the oracle, that it should be addressed directly by Jehovah to Sennacherib, as an answer to his bold challenge. The only address at all similar in Scripture is that to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/4-31.htm">Daniel 4:31, 32</a>), spoken by "a voice from heaven" But the present passage is one of far greater force and beauty. <span class="cmt_word">The virgin the daughter of Zion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the virgin daughter of Zion</span>, or <span class="accented">the virgin daughter</span>, <span class="accented">Zion</span>. Cities were commonly personified by the sacred writers, and represented as "daughters" (see <a href="/isaiah/23-10.htm">Isaiah 23:10, 12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1, 5</a>, etc.). "Virgin daughter" here may perhaps represent "the consciousness of impregnability" (Drechsler); but the phrase seems to have been used rhetorically or poetically, to heighten the beauty or pathos of the picture (<a href="/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-13.htm">Lamentations 2:13</a>), without any reference to the question whether the particular city had or had not been previously taken. Jerusalem certainly had been taken by Shishak (<a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>), and by Joash (<a href="/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>); but Zion, if it be taken as the name of the eastern city (Bishop Patrick, <span class="accented">ad</span> lee.), may have been still a "virgin fortress." <span class="cmt_word">Hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn</span>; or, <span class="accented">despises thee and laughs thee to scorn</span>. The Hebrew preterite has often a present sense. Whatever was the case a little while ago (see <a href="/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1-14</a>), the city now laughs at thy threats. <span class="cmt_word">The daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee</span>;
