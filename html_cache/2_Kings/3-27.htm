The firstborn son was the heir to the throne, highlighting the gravity of the king's actions. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the firstborn son held a place of prominence and was often seen as the future hope of the dynasty. This act underscores the king's desperation and the severe threat he perceived from the Israelite coalition.<p><b>and offered him as a burnt offering on the city wall</b><br>Human sacrifice, though abhorrent to the Israelites, was practiced by some neighboring cultures, including the Moabites. The act of offering a burnt sacrifice on the city wall was likely intended to invoke the favor of the Moabite god Chemosh. This public display was meant to rally the Moabite people and possibly to invoke divine intervention. The city wall was a place of visibility, indicating the king's intent to make a dramatic statement both to his people and to the besieging forces.<p><b>And there was great fury against the Israelites</b><br>The "great fury" could be interpreted as divine wrath or the psychological impact of the king's drastic action on the Israelite forces. Some scholars suggest that the Israelites may have perceived this act as invoking a curse or divine intervention against them, leading to their retreat. This phrase highlights the turning point in the battle, where the psychological and spiritual dimensions of warfare in the ancient world come into play.<p><b>so they withdrew and returned to their own land</b><br>The withdrawal of the Israelite forces marks the end of the campaign against Moab. Despite their military advantage, the Israelites' retreat suggests a recognition of the power of the Moabite king's sacrifice, whether through fear, superstition, or a perceived divine mandate. This outcome reflects the complex interplay of faith, fear, and cultural practices in ancient warfare. The return to their own land signifies the cessation of hostilities and the limits of military power when confronted with spiritual and psychological factors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_moab.htm">King of Moab (Mesha)</a></b><br>The ruler of Moab who, in desperation, sacrificed his firstborn son to appease his gods and turn the tide of battle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation led by King Jehoram, allied with Judah and Edom, engaged in battle against Moab.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom, allied with Israel in this military campaign.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A neighboring nation also allied with Israel and Judah in the conflict against Moab.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_wall.htm">City Wall</a></b><br>The location where the king of Moab made the sacrifice, symbolizing a public and desperate act.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_desperation_of_idolatry.htm">The Desperation of Idolatry</a></b><br>The king of Moab's act of sacrificing his son illustrates the extreme measures people may take when relying on false gods.

There is a reference to such hideous sacrifices in <a href="/micah/6-7.htm" title="Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?">Micah 6:7</a>, "Shall I give my firstborn for my transgressions?" In dark times of national calamity the Hebrews were prone, like their neighbours, to seek help in the same dreadful rites. (Comp. the case of Manasseh, <a href="/2_chronicles/33-6.htm" title="And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2Chronicles 33:6</a>; see also <a href="/context/psalms/106-37.htm" title="Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils,">Psalm 106:37-39</a>.) From the cuneiform records we learn that the sacrifice of children was also a Babylonian practice. (<a href="/amos/2-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:">Amos 2:1</a> refers to a totally different event from that recorded in the text.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he took his eldest son, that should have reigned in his stead</span> - the throne of Moab being hereditary, and primogeniture the established law (cf. Moabite Stone, lines 2 and 3, "My father reigned over Moab thirty years, and I reigned after my father") - <span class="cmt_word">and offered him for a burnt offering.</span> Human sacrifice was widely practiced by the idolatrous nations who bordered on Palestine, and by none more than by the Moabites. A former King of Moab, when in a sore strait, had asked, "Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?" (<a href="/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>); and there is reason to believe that a chief element in the worship of Chemosh was the sacrifice of young children by their unnatural parents. The practice rested on the idea that God was best pleased when men offered to him what was dearest and most precious to them; but it was in glaring contradiction to the character of God as revealed by his prophets, and it did violence to the best and holiest instincts of human nature. The Law condemned it in the strongest terms as a profanation of the Divine Name (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-1.htm">Leviticus 20:1-5</a>), and neither Jeroboam nor Ahab ventured to introduce it when they established their idolatrous systems. The King of Mesh, undoubtedly, offered the sacrifice to his god Chemosh (see Moabite Stone, lines 3, 4, 8, 12, etc.), hoping to propitiate him, and by his aid to escape from the peril in which he found himself placed. HIS motive for offering the sacrifice <span class="cmt_word">upon the wall</span> is not so clear. It was evidently done to attract the notice of the besiegers, but with what further <span class="accented">object</span> is uncertain. Ewald thinks the king's intention was to" confound the enemy by the spectacle of the frightful deed to which they had forced him," and thus to "effect a change in their purposes" ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 90); but perhaps it is as likely that he hoped to work upon their fears, and induce them to retire under the notion that, if they did not, Chemosh would do them some terrible injury. <span class="cmt_word">And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed.</span> It seems necessary to connect these clauses, and to regard them as assigning cause and effect. The deed done aroused an indignation against Israel, which led to the siege being raised. But an indignation on whose part? Keil thinks, on God's. But could God be angry with Israel for an act of the King of Moab, which they had no ground for anticipating, and which they could not possibly have pro-vented? especially when the Israelites had done nothing to cause the act, except by carrying out God's own command to them through his prophet, to "smite every fenced city and every choice city" (ver. 19). The indignation, therefore, must have been human. But who felt it? Probably the Moabites. The terrible act of their king, to which they considered that Israel had driven him, stirred up such a feeling of fury among the residue of the Moabite nation, that the confederates quailed before it, and came to the conclusion that they had best give up the siege and retire. They therefore departed from him - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the King of Mesh - and returned to their own land; severally to Edom, Judea, and Samaria. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/3-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So he took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
