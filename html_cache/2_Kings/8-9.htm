This meeting signifies the recognition of Elisha's prophetic authority even among foreign nations. Historically, Hazael would later become king of Aram, fulfilling Elisha's prophecy (<a href="/2_kings/8-13.htm">2 Kings 8:13</a>). This encounter foreshadows the significant role Hazael will play in the region's history.<p><b>taking with him a gift of forty camel loads of every good thing from Damascus</b><br>The lavish gift underscores the wealth and prosperity of Damascus, the capital of Aram, and the seriousness of the king's inquiry. In ancient Near Eastern culture, bringing gifts to a prophet or seer was customary to show respect and seek favor. The number forty often symbolizes completeness or abundance in the Bible, indicating the magnitude of the offering.<p><b>And he went in and stood before him</b><br>Hazael's approach to Elisha demonstrates humility and respect, acknowledging Elisha's spiritual authority. This act of standing before a prophet is a common biblical motif, signifying readiness to receive divine insight or instruction. It also reflects the cultural practice of seeking counsel from those believed to have a connection with the divine.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent me to ask</b><br>The phrase "Your son" is a term of respect, indicating a relationship of deference and honor towards Elisha. Ben-hadad, the king of Aram, seeks Elisha's prophetic insight, showing the influence and reach of Elisha's reputation. This inquiry highlights the interconnectedness of the political and spiritual realms in the ancient world.<p><b>&#8216;Will I recover from this illness?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The question reveals the king's desperation and hope for recovery, seeking assurance from a divine source. Illness in the ancient context was often seen as a sign of divine displeasure or a test of faith. This inquiry sets the stage for the unfolding of God's plan, as Elisha's response will have significant implications for the future of Aram and Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hazael.htm">Hazael</a></b><br>A servant of King Ben-hadad of Aram, who later becomes king himself.

In Near-Eastern culture, gifts honored a superior (<a href="/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>, <a href="/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16</a>). Here the king of Aram treats Elisha as the greater.<p>&#8226; Similar gifts accompany Naaman&#8217;s earlier visit (<a href="/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5</a>); both incidents reveal gentile leaders admitting Israel&#8217;s God-given authority.<p>&#8226; Forty camels echo the &#8220;very large caravan&#8221; of the queen of Sheba (<a href="/1_kings/10-2.htm">1 Kings 10:2</a>), reminding us that material splendor is still subject to God&#8217;s word (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Though the prophet will accept no bribe (cf. <a href="/2_kings/5-16.htm">2 Kings 5:16</a>), the narrative stresses that God&#8217;s counsel cannot be bought.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he went in and stood before him</b><p>Hazael&#8217;s posture of standing signals deference (<a href="/esther/5-2.htm">Esther 5:2</a>) and accountability (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>). Physical presence before the prophet parallels standing before the LORD Himself (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-17.htm">Deuteronomy 19:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Elisha allows access, in contrast to the earlier episode when he sent a messenger to Naaman (<a href="/2_kings/5-10.htm">2 Kings 5:10</a>); God varies His methods to fit His purposes.<p>&#8226; The scene anticipates Hazael&#8217;s coming authority: before he stands over Israel, he must first stand under God&#8217;s word (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And said, &#8220;Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent me to ask&#8221;</b><p>Calling himself &#8220;your son&#8221; shows a recognized spiritual hierarchy (<a href="/2_kings/6-21.htm">2 Kings 6:21</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/24-11.htm">1 Samuel 24:11</a>). The king of Aram bows, at least verbally, beneath the prophet&#8217;s paternal mantle.<p>&#8226; Earthly crowns lie under prophetic oversight (<a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also masks political calculation: Ben-hadad hopes alliance with Elisha will secure his own life, not realizing God has already decreed a different outcome (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will I recover from this illness?</b><p>Ben-hadad fears death and seeks an unequivocal answer, much like Hezekiah later (<a href="/isaiah/38-1.htm">Isaiah 38:1&#8211;6</a>). Yet motives matter: whereas Hezekiah humbly weeps, Ben-hadad hedges his bets through gift-laden diplomacy.<p>&#8226; Turning to the prophet rather than pagan idols contrasts favorably with Ahaziah&#8217;s fatal inquiry (<a href="/2_kings/1-16.htm">2 Kings 1:16</a>), yet sincerity still lacks.<p>&#8226; God will give a nuanced reply&#8212;immediate recovery outwardly, inevitable death ultimately&#8212;exposing the limits of human scheming (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The question itself sets the stage for Hazael&#8217;s grim rise (<a href="/2_kings/8-10.htm">2 Kings 8:10&#8211;15</a>), proving that divine revelation calls for submission, not manipulation (<a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a> captures a moment when Syria&#8217;s court seeks Israel&#8217;s God through His prophet. Hazael&#8217;s respectful approach, lavish gift, humble stance, and carefully worded inquiry all spotlight the supremacy of God&#8217;s word over political power and wealth. Yet the forthcoming prophecy will reveal that true security lies not in gifts or titles but in wholehearted obedience. God&#8217;s literal, unfolding plan will elevate Hazael, topple Ben-hadad, and vindicate Elisha&#8217;s every syllable&#8212;reminding us that every nation, ruler, and individual must ultimately bow to the Lord who declares &#8220;the end from the beginning.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">A present with him</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, in money.

Orientals are guilty of extreme ostentation with respect to the presents that they make. As Chardin says, "Fifty persons often carry what a single one could have very well borne" ('Voyage en Perse,' vol. 3. p. 217). The practice is illustrated by the bas-reliefs of Nineveh and Persepolis, which furnish proofs of its antiquity. One present-bearer carries a few pomegranates; another, a bunch of grapes; a third, a string of locusts; a fourth, two small ointment-pots; a fifth, a branch of an olive tree, and the like (Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' second series, pls. 8, 9, etc.). It is not unlikely that a single camel could have carried the whole. <span class="cmt_word">And earns and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad King of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying</span> - Benhadad seeks to propitiate Elisha by calling himself his son, thus indicating the respect he feels for him (comp. <a href="/2_kings/6-21.htm">2 Kings 6:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">Shall I recover of this disease?</span> Nothing was more common in the ancient world than the consultation of an oracle or a prophet in cases of disease or other bodily affliction. Two questions were commonly asked, "Shall I recover?" and "How may I recover?" So Pheron of Egypt is said to have consulted an oracle with respect to his blindness (Herod., 2:111), and Battus of Cyrene to have done the same with respect to his stammering (ibid., 4:155). It was seldom that a clear and direct answer was given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/8-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Hazael</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1494;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;z&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2371.htm">Strong's 2371: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hazael -- 'God sees', a king of Aram (Syria)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
