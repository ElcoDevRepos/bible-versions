His role was significant in the Babylonian military hierarchy, and he was directly responsible for executing the orders of King Nebuchadnezzar. This title indicates his authority and the trust placed in him by the Babylonian king. Historically, the Babylonians were known for their military prowess and administrative efficiency, which is reflected in the structured roles of their officials.<p><b>carried into exile the people who remained in the city</b><br>The city referred to here is Jerusalem, which had been under siege by the Babylonians. The exile was a fulfillment of the prophecies given by prophets like Jeremiah, who warned of the coming judgment due to the people's disobedience to God. The carrying away into exile was a common practice in ancient times, used to prevent rebellion and to assimilate conquered peoples into the empire. This event marks a pivotal moment in Jewish history, known as the Babylonian Captivity, which had profound theological and cultural implications for the Jewish people.<p><b>along with the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon</b><br>Deserters were those who had chosen to align themselves with the Babylonians, possibly seeking safety or favor. This act of defection was seen as betrayal by their fellow countrymen but was a pragmatic choice for survival. The mention of deserters highlights the internal divisions and desperation within Jerusalem during the siege. It also reflects the broader theme of loyalty and faithfulness found throughout the Bible, contrasting those who remain faithful to God with those who seek security in worldly powers.<p><b>and the rest of the population</b><br>This phrase indicates that not only the leaders or the elite were taken but also the common people. The comprehensive nature of the exile underscores the totality of the judgment against Judah. It also sets the stage for the eventual return and restoration, as prophesied by Isaiah and others, pointing to God's faithfulness and the hope of redemption. The exile served as a period of purification and reflection for the Jewish people, leading to a renewed commitment to their covenant with God upon their return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuzaradan.htm">Nebuzaradan</a></b><br>The captain of the guard for the king of Babylon, responsible for carrying out the exile of the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_babylon.htm">The King of Babylon</a></b><br>At this time, the Babylonian Empire was under the rule of King Nebuchadnezzar II, who orchestrated the siege and destruction of Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exile.htm">The Exile</a></b><br>The forced removal of the Jewish people from their homeland to Babylon, marking a significant event in Jewish history known as the Babylonian Captivity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deserters.htm">The Deserters</a></b><br>Those who had defected to the Babylonians during the siege, possibly seeking safety or favor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_populace.htm">The Populace</a></b><br>The remaining inhabitants of Jerusalem who were not killed or left behind to tend the land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The exile serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.

Having burnt the temple, the royal palace, and the grand residences of the principal citizens, Nebuzar-adan proceeded to divide the inhabitants of the city and country into two bodies - those whom he would leave in the land, and those whom he would carry off. The line of demarcation was, in a general way, a social one. The rich and well-to-do he would take with him; the poor and insignificant he would leave behind (vers. 11, 12). Among the former were included the high priest, the "second priest," three of the temple Levites, the commandant of the city, a certain number of the royal councilors, the "principal scribe of the host," and sixty of the "princes" (vers. 18, 19). The latter were chiefly persons of the agricultural class, who were left to be "vinedressers and husbandmen." From the temple, which had been already plundered twice (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-7.htm">2 Chronicles 36:7, 10</a>), he carried off such vessels in gold and silver and bronze as were still remaining there, together with the bronze of the two pillars Jachin and Boaz, of the great laver, or "molten sea," and of the stands for the smaller layers, all of which he broke up (ver. 13). Having reached Riblah, where Nebuchadnezzar still was, he delivered up to him both the booty and the prisoners. Rather more than seventy of the latter Nebuchadnezzar punished with death (ver. 21).
