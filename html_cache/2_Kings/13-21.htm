The act of burying the dead was a significant cultural and religious practice, reflecting the Israelites' respect for the deceased. The burial customs of ancient Israel often involved placing the body in a tomb or grave, which was a communal and familial responsibility.<p><b>suddenly they saw a band of raiders,</b><br>The presence of raiders indicates a period of insecurity and threat, likely from neighboring nations such as the Moabites, who frequently invaded Israelite territory. This reflects the historical context of the divided kingdom, where Israel faced constant threats from surrounding enemies.<p><b>so they threw the man&#8217;s body into Elisha&#8217;s tomb.</b><br>Elisha was a prominent prophet in Israel, and his tomb would have been a place of reverence. The act of throwing the body into Elisha's tomb was likely a hasty decision made out of fear of the raiders. This reflects the urgency and desperation of the situation, as well as the belief in the sanctity of the prophet's resting place.<p><b>And as soon as his body touched the bones of Elisha,</b><br>This phrase highlights the miraculous nature of the event. Elisha, known for his many miracles during his lifetime, continues to be a vessel of God's power even in death. The touching of Elisha's bones signifies a direct contact with the divine power that resided with the prophet.<p><b>the man was revived and stood up on his feet.</b><br>The revival of the man is a testament to the power of God working through His prophets. This miracle serves as a sign of God's continued presence and power in Israel, even during times of turmoil. It also prefigures the resurrection power seen in the New Testament, drawing a parallel to the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the promise of eternal life for believers.

They did not "throw" the body in, but pushed it in. <span class="cmt_word">And when the man was let down.</span> The man was not "let down." Our translators seem to have been unacquainted with the Jewish mode of burial. They imagine that Elisha's tomb is a pit dug in the ground from the surface downwards, like a modern grave, and the man has therefore to be "let <span class="accented">down</span>," or to "go <span class="accented">down"</span> (marginal translation) into it. The Revised Version avoids the mistranslation, but weakens the force of the original. Translate, <span class="accented">and when the man came</span>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">And touched the bones of Elisha, he revived.</span> The violent push given to the corpse imparted to it a movement which brought it in contact with the bones, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the body (<a href="/1_kings/13-31.htm">1 Kings 13:31</a>) of Elisha, as it lay, wound in its grave-clothes, but uncoffined, on the floor of the sepulchral chamber. At the moment of contact the dead man came to life - "revived." <span class="cmt_word">And stood up on his feet.</span> In many Jewish tombs the sepulchral chamber would allow of this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/13-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Once,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
