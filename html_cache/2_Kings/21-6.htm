The act is associated with the worship of the Canaanite god Molech, a practice that was prevalent among the surrounding pagan nations. Archaeological evidence from sites like Carthage suggests that child sacrifice was indeed practiced in the ancient Near East. This act by Manasseh, king of Judah, represents a severe departure from the worship of Yahweh and a return to the abominable practices of the nations that God had driven out before the Israelites.<p><b>practiced sorcery and divination</b><br>Sorcery and divination were condemned in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>) as they involved seeking guidance and power from sources other than God. These practices were common in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, where people sought to predict the future or manipulate events through supernatural means. Manasseh's engagement in these practices indicates a reliance on occult powers rather than on the God of Israel, further illustrating his rebellion against divine commandments.<p><b>and consulted mediums and spiritists</b><br>Mediums and spiritists were individuals who claimed to communicate with the dead or with spirits, a practice explicitly prohibited in Israel (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7-9</a>). This consultation with the dead was seen as an attempt to gain forbidden knowledge and power, bypassing God's revelation. The story of Saul consulting the medium at Endor (1 Samuel 28) serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers and futility of such practices.<p><b>He did great evil in the sight of the LORD</b><br>This summary statement underscores the gravity of Manasseh's actions. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" emphasizes that God's perspective is the ultimate measure of morality. Manasseh's reign is characterized by a deliberate and flagrant violation of God's laws, leading to spiritual and moral decay in Judah. His actions are contrasted with the righteous kings of Judah who sought to follow God's commandments.<p><b>provoking Him to anger</b><br>The provocation of God's anger is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often resulting from idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7-8</a>, <a href="/judges/2-12.htm">Judges 2:12</a>). God's anger is not capricious but is a response to the breach of the covenant relationship. Manasseh's actions, including idolatry and the shedding of innocent blood, are seen as direct affronts to God's holiness and justice, leading to divine judgment. This foreshadows the eventual exile of Judah as a consequence of persistent disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned for 55 years and is known for his idolatrous practices and leading Judah into sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Manasseh ruled, and which was influenced by his actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sorcery_and_divination.htm">Sorcery and Divination</a></b><br>Practices condemned by God, involving attempts to gain knowledge or power through supernatural means other than God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mediums_and_spiritists.htm">Mediums and Spiritists</a></b><br>Individuals who claim to communicate with the dead or spirits, practices forbidden in the Law of Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_anger.htm">The LORD's Anger</a></b><br>The response of God to the evil practices of Manasseh, highlighting the seriousness of his sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Manasseh's actions led to severe consequences for Judah, reminding us of the destructive nature of idolatry and sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>God's laws against sorcery and divination are clear, and obedience to His commands is crucial for a faithful life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_anger_and_justice.htm">God's Anger and Justice</a></b><br>The passage highlights that God is just and His anger is kindled by sin, urging us to live righteously.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>Despite Manasseh's grave sins, his later repentance shows that God's mercy is available to all who turn back to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_cultural_influences.htm">Guarding Against Cultural Influences</a></b><br>Manasseh was influenced by surrounding pagan practices, teaching us to be vigilant against cultural pressures that lead us away from God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_21_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 21:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_21_6_Dangers_of_forsaking_God.htm">How does 2 Kings 21:6 illustrate the dangers of abandoning God's commandments?

It was usually the eldest son, who, as the most precious possible offering, was sacrificed to Moloch (see <a href="/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; and, for the true nature of the sacrifice, see the comment on this latter passage). <span class="cmt_word">And observed times.</span> If this translation is right, the reference would be to a superstitious regard for lucky and unlucky days, such as we note in the accounts left of themselves by the Baby-Ionian kings, who begin their buildings "in a happy month, on an auspicious day" (see the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 487). But probably the true meaning is, "he exercised <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>," or, "had regard to the evil eye," a common superstition in the East. <span class="cmt_word">And used enchantments.</span> A use of spoils is perhaps intended, such as those by which serpents (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) were charmed (see the comment on Isaiah 47:9). <span class="cmt_word">And dealt with familiar spirits and wizards</span> - rather, <span class="accented">he placed in office necromancers</span> (literally, a <span class="accented">necromancer</span>) <span class="accented">and wizards</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he gave such persons official positions at his court, instead of putting them to death, as the Law (<a href="/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>) required - <span class="cmt_word">he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he multiplied to work wickedness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he sought out every possible way; he not only restored all the different kinds of heathen sacrifices and idolatrous customs which had been in use under Ahaz, but carried his opposition to Jehovah a great deal further. As Ewald says ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 208), "He endeavored to become acquainted with all the heathen religions he could find and introduce them into Judah. For this purpose he sent into the most distant lands where there was any famous cultus, and grudged no pains for his one object." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/21-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He sacrificed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1462;&#1506;&#1457;&#1489;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;he&#183;&#8216;&#277;&#183;&#7687;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
