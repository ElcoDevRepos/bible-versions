His reign is noted for its prosperity and military success. Elath, a port city on the Red Sea, was strategically important for trade and military purposes. Rebuilding Elath signifies a period of expansion and economic growth for Judah. This act demonstrates Azariah's focus on strengthening Judah's infrastructure and securing trade routes, which were vital for the kingdom's wealth and stability.<p><b>and restored it to Judah</b><br>The restoration of Elath to Judah indicates that the city had previously been lost or under foreign control. This action reflects Azariah's efforts to reclaim and consolidate territories that were historically part of Judah. It also underscores the importance of Elath as a key location for trade and military advantage. The restoration can be seen as a fulfillment of the Davidic promise of territorial expansion and prosperity for the kingdom.<p><b>after King Amaziah rested with his fathers.</b><br>King Amaziah, Azariah's father, had a reign marked by both military success and failure. His defeat by Jehoash of Israel led to a period of instability. The phrase "rested with his fathers" is a biblical euphemism for death, indicating the end of Amaziah's reign and the transition of power to Azariah. This transition marks a new chapter for Judah, with Azariah's reign bringing renewed strength and stability. The continuity of leadership from Amaziah to Azariah highlights the dynastic succession of the Davidic line, which is significant in biblical prophecy concerning the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah.htm">Azariah (Uzziah)</a></b><br>Also known as Uzziah, he was the king of Judah who succeeded his father Amaziah.

The verse opens by spotlighting Azariah (also called Uzziah; see <a href="/2_chronicles/26-1.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1</a>), underscoring personal responsibility and leadership.<p>&#8226; God often singles out individuals who respond to His call; compare Gideon in <a href="/judges/6-14.htm">Judges 6:14&#8211;16</a> and Josiah in <a href="/2_kings/22-1.htm">2 Kings 22:1&#8211;2</a>.<p>&#8226; The statement affirms that Azariah&#8212;not a committee, not a foreign ally&#8212;took decisive action, reminding us that godly initiative matters.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who rebuilt Elath</b><p>&#8226; Elath (sometimes spelled Eloth) was a strategic Red Sea port at the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba (<a href="/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Rebuilding indicates the city had been damaged or neglected, likely during earlier conflicts with Edom (<a href="/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; By repairing the port, Azariah revived Judah&#8217;s access to maritime trade, echoing Solomon&#8217;s earlier naval ventures (<a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And restored it to Judah</b><p>&#8226; This clause highlights reassertion of covenant territory. <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18&#8211;21</a> forecasts Israel&#8217;s broad inheritance; each reclaimed city displays God&#8217;s faithfulness in tangible geography.<p>&#8226; Restoration implies something lost is now recovered, paralleling Nehemiah&#8217;s later wall-building (<a href="/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical blessings flowed: economic strength, national security, and renewed hope for the people of Judah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>After King Amaziah rested with his fathers</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Rested with his fathers&#8221; is a respectful way of noting Amaziah&#8217;s death (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-28.htm">2 Chronicles 25:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Transition of leadership can either stall or speed kingdom progress; here, momentum increased under Azariah, reminiscent of Joshua advancing after Moses (<a href="/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; The timing underscores that God&#8217;s purposes outlive any single generation (<a href="/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Spiritual implications</b><p>&#8226; God honors leaders who repair what is broken&#8212;whether cities, worship, or relationships (<a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Strategic obedience, even in infrastructure, displays stewardship of divine gifts (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord uses restored places to bless His people, foreshadowing Christ&#8217;s ultimate restoration of all things (<a href="/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a> records Azariah&#8217;s decisive act of rebuilding Elath and returning it to Judah after Amaziah&#8217;s death. The verse showcases personal leadership, fulfillment of covenant promises, economic and strategic wisdom, and the continuity of God&#8217;s work across generations. By highlighting one king&#8217;s faithful initiative, Scripture encourages every believer to reclaim and rebuild whatever the Lord entrusts to them, trusting His ongoing faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">He built Elath.</span>--The pronoun is emphatic; <span class= "ital">he,</span> in contrast with his father. "Built," either <span class= "ital">rebuilt</span> or <span class= "ital">fortified.</span> The verse is in close connection with the preceding narrative. Amaziah perhaps had not vigorously prosecuted the conquest of Edom, having been greatly weakened by his defeat in the struggle with Jehoash. He may even have suffered some further losses at the hands of the Edomites; and this, as Thenius supposes may have led to the conspiracy which brought about his death and the accession of his son. The warlike youth Uzziah took the field at once, and pushed his victorious arms to the southern extremity of Edom, the port of Elath (<a href="/2_kings/9-26.htm" title="Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, said the LORD; and I will requite you in this plat, said the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.">2Kings 9:26</a>), and thus restored the state of things which had existed under Solomon and Jehoshaphat.<p><span class= "bld">After that the king slept</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, immediately after the murder of Amaziah. Thenius explains the verse with most success, but this clause is still somewhat surprising.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He built Elath, and restored it to Judah.</span> On the position of Elath, or Eloth, and its importance, see the comment on 1 Kings 9:26. It had been the headquarters of Solomon's fleet (<a href="/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>), and again of Jehoshaphat's (<a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36</a>); but had been, of course, recovered by the Edomites when they revolted (<a href="/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>). Azariah's re-occupation seems to imply an intention on his part of, renewing the old Red Sea trade. By "built ' in this passage we must understand "rebuilt" or (as in <a href="/2_chronicles/11-6.htm">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>) "fortified." <span class="cmt_word">After that the king slept with his fathers.</span> Keil is probably right in understanding this to mean "immediately after he had ascended the throne," or "as soon as ever his father was dead" (see the comment on ver. 19). His further military successes will be considered in the comment on his reign, as sketched in the next chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/14-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[Azariah was the one]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1434;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who rebuilt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1129.htm">Strong's 1129: </a> </span><span class="str2">To build</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Elath</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1463;&#1428;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;la&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_359.htm">Strong's 359: </a> </span><span class="str2">Eloth -- 'grove of lofty trees'</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and restored it</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#353;i&#183;&#7687;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
