His death marks the end of an era of prophetic leadership that was characterized by direct divine intervention. Elisha's burial signifies the honor given to him, as burial was an important cultural practice in ancient Israel, reflecting respect and remembrance. His death also fulfills the natural course of life, even for a man of God, reminding us of the mortality of all humans. Elisha's ministry is often seen as a type of Christ, as he performed miracles that foreshadowed those of Jesus, such as raising the dead and multiplying food.<p><b>Now the Moabite raiders used to come into the land every spring.</b><br>The Moabites were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel. Their raids into Israelite territory during the spring were strategic, as this was the time of harvest when resources were plentiful. This historical context highlights the constant threat and instability faced by Israel due to surrounding nations. The Moabite incursions are a reminder of the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God, as foreign oppression was often a result of their turning away from Him. The cyclical nature of these raids underscores the persistent challenges Israel faced, which were often addressed by the prophets. The mention of Moabites also connects to other biblical narratives, such as the story of Ruth, a Moabite who became an ancestor of David and ultimately Jesus, illustrating God's redemptive plan through all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for performing many miracles and being a powerful voice for God during his lifetime.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moabite_raiders.htm">Moabite Raiders</a></b><br>Invaders from Moab, a neighboring nation often in conflict with Israel, who took advantage of Israel's vulnerabilities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often struggling with idolatry and conflict during this period.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burial_of_elisha.htm">Burial of Elisha</a></b><br>Marks the end of an era of prophetic ministry in Israel, highlighting the transition in leadership and spiritual guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/spring_raids.htm">Spring Raids</a></b><br>A time when the Moabites would exploit the agricultural cycle, raiding during the harvest season when resources were plentiful.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_legacy_of_faithful_service.htm">The Legacy of Faithful Service</a></b><br>Elisha's life and ministry remind us of the impact one faithful servant of God can have.

All the more anxious, therefore, would the Israelites be to bury their second great prophet with due honor. They prepared him, no doubt, one of those excavated sepulchers which were usual at the time and in the country - a squared or vaulted chamber cut in the native rock. St. Jerome says that the place of his sepulture was near Samaria ('Epitaph. Paulae'), and this is sufficiently probable; but in the Middle Ages his grave was shown at Ruma, in Galilee (Ewald, 'Hist. of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 122, note 3). According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:8. &sect; 6), his funeral was magnificent. <span class="cmt_word">And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.</span> It seems to be implied that this was a usual occurrence.
