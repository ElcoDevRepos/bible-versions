His actions were in fulfillment of the prophecy given to Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16-17</a>) and continued the work of reform started by Elijah and Elisha. Jehu's message was a strategic move to gather all the worshipers of Baal, demonstrating his cunning and determination to purify Israel from idolatry.<p><b>and all the servants of Baal came</b><br>The servants of Baal were those who actively participated in the worship and rituals dedicated to the Canaanite god Baal. This highlights the widespread influence of Baal worship in Israel, which had been introduced by Jezebel, the wife of King Ahab. The gathering of all these servants indicates the depth of idolatry that had permeated the nation, contrasting with the monotheistic worship of Yahweh.<p><b>there was not a man who failed to show</b><br>This phrase underscores the complete attendance of Baal's followers, suggesting either their devotion or fear of missing an important religious event. It also reflects Jehu's effective communication and authority, as he managed to gather every single worshiper, setting the stage for his decisive action against idolatry.<p><b>They entered the temple of Baal</b><br>The temple of Baal was a significant structure in Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Its presence indicates the institutionalization of Baal worship, which had been supported by previous kings. The temple served as a central place for idol worship, and its desecration by Jehu was a symbolic act of reclaiming Israel for Yahweh.<p><b>and it was filled from end to end</b><br>The complete filling of the temple signifies the large number of Baal worshipers in Israel, highlighting the challenge Jehu faced in turning the nation back to God. This scene sets the stage for Jehu's subsequent actions, which would lead to the destruction of Baal worship in Israel.

Compare Gideon&#8217;s call that gathered Midian&#8217;s enemies (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22-24</a>) and Elijah&#8217;s earlier assembly of Baal&#8217;s prophets on Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehu&#8217;s action fulfills God&#8217;s commission given through the prophet (<a href="/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6-10</a>); the eradication of Baal worship is an act of covenant faithfulness commanded in <a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the servants of Baal came; not a man failed to show</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and all the servants of Baal came; there was not a man who failed to show&#8221; (10:21b).<p>&#8226; Jehu&#8217;s proclamation is so persuasive that every devoted idolater responds, exposing themselves for judgment&#8212;much like the complete turnout of false prophets who dined with Jezebel (<a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Their eagerness contrasts with Israel&#8217;s frequent reluctance to gather for true worship (<a href="/isaiah/1-12.htm">Isaiah 1:12-15</a>), highlighting the deceptive pull of idolatry.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereign hand ensures none escape (<a href="/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>); their total presence paves the way for the prophesied purge (<a href="/2_kings/10-28.htm">2 Kings 10:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They entered the temple of Baal</b><p>&#8220;They entered the temple of Baal&#8221; (10:21c).<p>&#8226; The temple, erected by Ahab in Samaria (<a href="/1_kings/16-32.htm">1 Kings 16:32-33</a>), symbolizes a direct affront to the LORD&#8217;s exclusive sanctuary in Jerusalem (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; By stepping inside, the worshipers cross a line of unmistakable allegiance, reminiscent of the mixed multitude that worshiped the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-6.htm">Exodus 32:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehu&#8217;s soldiers stand outside (<a href="/2_kings/10-23.htm">2 Kings 10:23</a>), underscoring the separation between holy and profane (<a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It was filled from end to end</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and it was filled from end to end&#8221; (10:21d).<p>&#8226; The packed house highlights the depth of apostasy under Ahab&#8217;s dynasty&#8212;echoing Jesus&#8217; picture of the &#8220;broad road that leads to destruction&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13</a>).<p>&#8226; For Jehu, the crowded temple ensures a swift, decisive strike (<a href="/2_kings/10-24.htm">2 Kings 10:24-25</a>), parallel to Moses&#8217; call for the Levites to purify the camp after the calf incident (<a href="/exodus/32-25.htm">Exodus 32:25-29</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene underscores that idolatry may look powerful in numbers, yet God can overturn it in a moment (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/10-21.htm">2 Kings 10:21</a> shows Jehu cleverly gathering every Baal worshiper into one place so none escape God&#8217;s judgment.
