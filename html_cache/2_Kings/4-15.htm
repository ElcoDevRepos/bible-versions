This moment occurs in the context of Elisha's interactions with a Shunammite woman who has shown him great hospitality. The act of calling her signifies a moment of divine intervention and blessing. In biblical narratives, prophets often act as intermediaries between God and people, and Elisha's command here sets the stage for a significant announcement. This reflects the role of prophets in the Old Testament as messengers of God's will, similar to how God called Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3</a>.<p><b>said Elisha.</b><br>Elisha, whose name means "God is salvation," is a central figure in the books of Kings. He succeeded Elijah and performed many miracles, demonstrating God's power and presence among His people. Elisha's ministry is marked by acts of compassion and miraculous provision, which foreshadow the ministry of Jesus Christ, who also performed miracles and brought messages of hope and salvation.<p><b>So Gehazi called her,</b><br>Gehazi, Elisha's servant, plays a supporting role in Elisha's ministry. His actions here are obedient, reflecting the hierarchical structure of prophetic ministry. Gehazi's role is similar to that of other biblical figures who assist prophets, such as Joshua to Moses. This moment also highlights the importance of servanthood and obedience in fulfilling God's purposes.<p><b>and she stood in the doorway.</b><br>The Shunammite woman's position in the doorway is symbolic. In ancient Near Eastern culture, doorways were places of transition and decision. Standing in the doorway signifies a moment of anticipation and readiness to receive a message or blessing. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, where Jesus stands at the door and knocks, inviting believers to open their hearts to Him. The doorway here represents a threshold to a new chapter in the woman's life, as she is about to receive a promise from God through Elisha.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God, successor to Elijah, known for his miracles and guidance to the people of Israel.
