Prophets like Elijah, Elisha, Isaiah, and Hosea played significant roles in warning Israel and Judah. Seers, often synonymous with prophets, were those who had visions from God. This phrase emphasizes the consistent and persistent efforts of God to communicate with His people through various messengers.<p><b>the LORD warned Israel and Judah,</b><br>The division of the kingdom into Israel (the northern kingdom) and Judah (the southern kingdom) occurred after Solomon's reign. Despite their separation, both kingdoms were subject to God's covenant and His laws. The warnings were a call to repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness, highlighting God's desire for both kingdoms to turn back to Him.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Turn from your wicked ways</b><br>This call to repentance is a central theme throughout the Bible. Wicked ways refer to idolatry, injustice, and disobedience to God's commands. The call to turn is an invitation to repentance, a change of heart and action, which is a recurring message in the prophetic books.<p><b>and keep My commandments and statutes,</b><br>The commandments and statutes refer to the laws given by God, primarily through Moses. These laws were meant to guide the Israelites in living a life that was pleasing to God and distinct from the surrounding nations. Obedience to these laws was a sign of faithfulness to the covenant.<p><b>according to the entire Law that I commanded your fathers</b><br>The "entire Law" refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which contain the laws and commandments given to the Israelites. The reference to "your fathers" connects the current generation to their ancestors who received the Law at Mount Sinai, emphasizing continuity and the importance of tradition.<p><b>and delivered to you through My servants the prophets.&#8221;</b><br>The prophets served as God's messengers, delivering His words and instructions to the people. This phrase underscores the role of the prophets as intermediaries between God and His people, tasked with reminding them of the covenant and calling them back to obedience. The prophets' messages often included both warnings of judgment and promises of restoration, pointing ultimately to the hope found in the coming Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who communicates His will and warnings through His prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_and_seers.htm">Prophets and Seers</a></b><br>God's chosen messengers who convey His warnings and instructions to the people of Israel and Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel_and_judah.htm">Israel and Judah</a></b><br>The divided kingdoms of God's chosen people, who are being warned to turn from their sinful ways.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/commandments_and_statutes.htm">Commandments and Statutes</a></b><br>The laws given by God to the Israelites, which they are called to obey.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fathers.htm">Fathers</a></b><br>The ancestors of the Israelites, who received God's law and covenant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_persistent_warnings.htm">God's Persistent Warnings</a></b><br>God, in His mercy, continually warns His people through prophets.

But the words were used as synonyms (see <a href="/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>). Ever since the revolt of Jeroboam, there had been a succession of prophets in both countries whose office it had been to rebuke sin and to enforce the precepts of the Law. In Judah there had been Shemaiah, contemporary with Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-2.htm">2 Chronicles 11:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5</a>); Iddo, contemporary with Abijah (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-22.htm">2 Chronicles 13:22</a>); Azariah, with Asa (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-1.htm">2 Chronicles 15:1</a>); Hanani, with the same (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7</a>); Jehu, the son of Hanani, with Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>); Jahaziel, the son of Zechariah, with the same (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-14.htm">2 Chronicles 20:14</a>); Eliezer, the son of Dodavah, also contemporary with the same (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-37.htm">2 Chronicles 20:37</a>); Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, contemporary with Joash (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>); another Zechariah, contemporary with Uzziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5</a>); Joel, Micah, and Isaiah, besides several whose names are unknown. In Israel, the succession had included Ahijah the Shilonite, contemporary with Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/14-2.htm">1 Kings 14:2</a>); Jehu, the son of Hanani, with Baasha (<a href="/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1</a>); Elijah, and Micaiah the son of Imlah, with Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/22-8.htm">1 Kings 22:8</a>) and Ahaziah (<a href="/2_kings/1-3.htm">2 Kings 1:3</a>); Elisha, with Jehoram, John, Jehoahaz, and Joash (<a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11-13:14</a>); Jonah, with Jeroboam II.

God had never left himself without living witness. Besides the written testimony of the Law, he had sent them a continuous series of prophets, who "repeated and enforced the teaching of the Law by word of month, breathing into the old words a new life, applying them to the facts of their own times, urging them on the con- sciences of their hearers, and authoritatively declaring to them that the terrible threatenings of the Law were directed against the very sins which they habitually practiced." The prophets continually addressed them in the Name of God, saying, <span class="cmt_word">Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the Law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.</span> This was the general burden of the prophetical teaching, both in Israel and in Judah, both before the captivity of Israel and afterwards (see <a href="/hosea/12-6.htm">Hosea 12:6</a>;
