The act of pacing can be seen as a form of intense prayer or meditation, reflecting a deep reliance on God. In biblical context, prophets often engaged in physical acts as part of their intercessory efforts (e.g., Elijah on Mount Carmel in <a href="/1_kings/18-42.htm">1 Kings 18:42-44</a>). The room is likely the upper chamber prepared by the Shunammite woman, symbolizing a place set apart for divine encounters.<p><b>Then he got on the bed and stretched himself out over the boy again,</b><br>Elisha's actions mirror those of his mentor, Elijah, who performed a similar miracle in <a href="/1_kings/17-21.htm">1 Kings 17:21</a>. This physical act of stretching out over the boy signifies a transfer of life and power, symbolizing the prophet's role as a mediator of God's life-giving power. It also prefigures the concept of resurrection, a theme that finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection and the life (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>).<p><b>and the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.</b><br>The sneezing seven times is significant, as the number seven often represents completeness or perfection in the Bible (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>, <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>). This act signifies the complete restoration of life to the boy. The opening of the eyes symbolizes awakening and new life, akin to spiritual rebirth. This miracle foreshadows the resurrection power of Christ, who opens the eyes of the spiritually blind and brings life to the dead (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>, <a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God, successor to Elijah, known for performing miracles and being a powerful instrument of God's will.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shunammite_woman.htm">The Shunammite Woman</a></b><br>A hospitable woman who provided for Elisha and was blessed with a son through his prophecy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shunammite's_son.htm">The Shunammite's Son</a></b><br>The child miraculously given to the Shunammite woman, who later died and was brought back to life by Elisha.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shunem.htm">Shunem</a></b><br>The town where the Shunammite woman lived, located in the territory of Issachar.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle_of_resurrection.htm">The Miracle of Resurrection</a></b><br>The event where Elisha, through God's power, raises the Shunammite woman's son from the dead.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_power.htm">Faith in God's Power</a></b><br>Elisha's actions demonstrate unwavering faith in God's ability to perform miracles.
