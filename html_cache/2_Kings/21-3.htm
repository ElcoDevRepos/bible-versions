The high places were local worship sites often associated with idolatry and syncretism. Manasseh's rebuilding of these sites signifies a reversal of his father's reforms and a return to idolatrous practices. This act reflects a broader pattern of apostasy in Judah, contrasting with the Deuteronomic ideal of centralized worship in Jerusalem (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-5</a>).<p><b>and he raised up altars for Baal</b><br>Baal worship was a persistent issue in Israel and Judah, often associated with fertility rites and pagan practices. The altars for Baal indicate a formal reintroduction of Canaanite religious practices, which were explicitly condemned in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13-14</a>). This action aligns Manasseh with the northern kingdom's practices, particularly those of King Ahab, who institutionalized Baal worship (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31-33</a>).<p><b>He made an Asherah pole, as King Ahab of Israel had done</b><br>Asherah poles were wooden symbols associated with the Canaanite goddess Asherah, often placed near altars to Baal. The reference to King Ahab highlights the syncretism and idolatry that characterized his reign, which was condemned by prophets like Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>). Manasseh's actions suggest a deliberate emulation of Ahab's idolatrous practices, further indicating a departure from the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>and he worshiped and served all the host of heaven</b><br>This phrase indicates the introduction of astral worship, which involved the veneration of celestial bodies like the sun, moon, and stars. Such practices were common in the ancient Near East and were explicitly forbidden in the Hebrew Scriptures (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>). This form of idolatry represents a further deviation from monotheistic worship and reflects the influence of surrounding pagan cultures. The worship of the heavenly host is also mentioned in the context of later reforms by King Josiah, who sought to eradicate these practices (<a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The king of Judah who led the nation into idolatry, reversing the reforms of his father, Hezekiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>Manasseh's father, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to rid Judah of idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal.htm">Baal</a></b><br>A Canaanite deity often associated with fertility and storms, worshiped by many in the region.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/asherah_pole.htm">Asherah Pole</a></b><br>A wooden symbol associated with the worship of the goddess Asherah, often placed near altars.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>A former king of Israel notorious for his promotion of Baal worship, married to Jezebel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_reverting_to_sinful_practices.htm">The Danger of Reverting to Sinful Practices</a></b><br>Manasseh's actions demonstrate how quickly a nation can fall back into sin when godly leadership is absent.

He restored forbidden high places, re-established Baal worship, erected an Asherah pole, and even bowed to the stars. Each action violated specific commands and mirrored the sins that had destroyed the northern kingdom. The verse underscores how quickly a nation can abandon truth when its leader rejects God&#8217;s Word, and it explains why God&#8217;s judgment on Judah became inevitable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">For he built up again.</span>--The LXX. and Vulg. imitate the Hebrew idiom, <span class= "ital">and he returned and built--i.e.,</span> <span class= "ital">and he rebuilt.</span><p><span class= "bld">The high places . . . altars for Baal . . . a grove </span>(<span class= "ital">an Ash?rah</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span>--"The idols, the sun-pillars, the <span class= "ital">ash?rim, </span>the sacred trees, and all the other pagan or half-pagan symbols, so plainly inconsistent with the prophetic faith, were of the very substance of Israel's worship in the popular sanctuaries" (<span class= "ital">Prof. Robertson Smith</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">As did Ahab.</span>--See <a href="/context/1_kings/16-32.htm" title="And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.">1Kings 16:32-33</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Worshipped all the host of heaven.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm" title="And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.">2Kings 17:16</a>, and comp. <a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm" title="And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.">2Kings 23:12</a>.

It had, perhaps, been introduced among the Jews by Ahaz (<a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>). At any rate, it was from the time of Manasseh one of the favorite idolatries of the Jewish people. The stars were believed to guide the destiny of men, and astrology was cultivated as a main part, or even as the essence, of religion. Astrological tracts form an important element in the literature of the Babylonians (see' Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 153-163). The chief objects of adoration in this worship were the sun and moon, the five planets, and the signs of the zodiac. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/21-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For he rebuilt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
