Jeroboam established golden calves at Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>) to prevent the Israelites from worshiping in Jerusalem, leading them into sin. This idolatry became a recurring theme and a stumbling block for subsequent kings and the people of Israel. The phrase underscores the spiritual stubbornness and rebellion against God's commandments, as the Israelites continued in practices that were explicitly condemned in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>).<p><b>but they continued to walk in them</b><br>The continuation in sin indicates a deliberate choice to persist in idolatrous practices despite the prophetic warnings and judgments that had come upon Israel. This reflects a cultural and spiritual entrenchment in idolatry, showing the difficulty of breaking free from established sinful traditions. The phrase suggests a lack of repentance and a failure to heed the messages of prophets like Elijah and Elisha, who called Israel back to covenant faithfulness. This persistence in sin is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, illustrating the human tendency to resist divine correction.<p><b>The Asherah pole even remained standing in Samaria</b><br>The Asherah pole was a symbol of the Canaanite goddess Asherah, often associated with fertility and worshiped alongside Baal. Its presence in Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom, signifies the official endorsement of idolatry by the ruling authorities. This pole's continued existence indicates the depth of syncretism in Israelite worship, blending pagan practices with the worship of Yahweh. The Asherah pole's presence in Samaria is a testament to the failure of Israel's leaders to uphold the covenant and eradicate idolatry, as commanded in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>.

This is written, of course, from the point of view of the Judaean editor of Kings, who lived long after the events of which he is writing in the period of the exile. It does not appear from the history of Elijah and Elisha, incorporated in his work, that either of those great prophets ever protested against the worship established at Bethel and Dan.<p><span class= "bld">The house of Jeroboam</span>--Some MSS., the Syriac, Targum, and Arabic omit "house." But the specification of the <span class= "ital">dynasty</span> is here very appropriate.<p><span class= "bld">But walked therein.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">therein they walked;</span> the reading of the LXX. (Alex.),Vulg., and Targum being probably correct. It is the conduct of the <span class= "ital">nation</span> that is being described.<p><span class= "bld">And there remained the grove also in Samaria.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">and moreover the Asherah stood </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., was set up</span>)<span class= "ital"> in Samaria.</span> The Asherah was the sacred tree, so often depicted in Assyrian art. It symbolised the productive principle of nature, and was sacred to Ashtoreth. With the return of peace, and the renewal of prosperity, luxury also soon reappeared, and the idolatry that specially countenanced it lifted up its head again. (See the Note on <a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm" title="And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.">2Kings 17:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin.</span> "The house of Jeroboam" is an unusual expression in this connection, and is scarcely appropriate, since every "house" had acted in the same way, Some manuscripts omit the word, and it is wanting in the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic versions. Thenius would cancel it. <span class="cmt_word">But walked therein</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he walked</span>. But here again a corruption may be suspected.

Some think that it was "an image of Astarte" (see 'Homiletic Commentary' on 1 Kings, p. 374); but more probably it was a mere emblem, analogous to the Assyrian "sacred tree." Its material may sometimes have been wood, but was perhaps more usually metal. The mistranslation "grove" originated with the Septuagint translators, who uniformly rendered <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. It is surprising that Jehu did not destroy the <span class="accented">asherah</span> together with the other idolatrous erections of Ahab in Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/10-26.htm">2 Kings 10:26-28</a>); but, for some reason or other, it seems to have been spared, and to have been still standing. So long as it stood, even if it did not attract the religious regards of any, it would be a standing dishonor to God, and would so increase the sin of the nation. Hence its mention in this passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/13-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Nevertheless,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1440;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_389.htm">Strong's 389: </a> </span><span class="str2">A particle of affirmation, surely</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they did not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">turn away</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1464;&#1436;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#257;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5493.htm">Strong's 5493: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn aside</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from the sins</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1465;&#1447;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#7717;a&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
