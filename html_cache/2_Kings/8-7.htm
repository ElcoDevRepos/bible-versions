This visit underscores the reach of God's influence beyond Israel's borders. Historically, Damascus was a significant city in the ancient Near East, known for its strategic location and wealth. Elisha's presence there highlights the prophetic role in international affairs, reminiscent of Elijah's interactions with foreign powers (<a href="/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15</a>).<p><b>while Ben-hadad king of Aram was sick</b><br>Ben-hadad, a common name for Aramean kings, was a formidable adversary of Israel. His illness sets the stage for a divine intervention through Elisha. The mention of his sickness may indicate a moment of vulnerability, both personally and politically, for Aram. This context is crucial as it opens the door for God's message to be delivered to a foreign king, similar to how God used Joseph and Daniel in foreign courts (Genesis 41; <a href="/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>).<p><b>and the king was told,</b><br>The king's awareness of Elisha's presence suggests the prophet's reputation had spread beyond Israel. This acknowledgment by a foreign king highlights the respect and recognition Elisha commanded, akin to the acknowledgment of Joseph's wisdom by Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38-39</a>). It also sets the stage for the unfolding events, where divine insight will be sought from the prophet.<p><b>&#8220;The man of God has come here.&#8221;</b><br>The title "man of God" is a significant recognition of Elisha's role and authority as a prophet. It denotes a person who speaks on behalf of God, carrying divine authority and insight. This acknowledgment by a foreign court underscores the universal recognition of God's power and the prophetic office. It also foreshadows the influence Elisha will have in the events to follow, similar to how Jesus was recognized as a man of God by those outside the Jewish community (<a href="/mark/5-7.htm">Mark 5:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God, successor to Elijah, known for performing miracles and providing guidance to the kings of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/damascus.htm">Damascus</a></b><br>The capital city of Aram (modern-day Syria), a significant political and trade center in the ancient Near East.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram, who was ill at the time of Elisha's visit.

Elisha&#8217;s arrival fulfills and advances that earlier word, underscoring that the Lord&#8217;s plan never stalls.<p>&#8226; Elisha&#8217;s willingness to walk straight into the opponent&#8217;s stronghold shows that the Lord&#8217;s prophet goes wherever God&#8217;s purpose requires, just as Paul later carried the gospel into Corinth and Rome (<a href="/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1</a>; 28:16).<p>&#8226; Geography matters: from Samaria to Damascus is roughly 100 miles. This is deliberate obedience, not a casual drop-in. It mirrors Christ&#8217;s intentional journey to Jerusalem &#8220;when the days drew near&#8221; (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>while Ben-hadad king of Aram was sick</b><p>&#8226; Ben-hadad II has fought Israel repeatedly (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/20.htm">1 Kings 20</a>; <a href="/bsb/2_kings/6.htm">2 Kings 6&#8211;7</a>). Now he lies on a sickbed, a vivid reminder that no power or palace shields a sinner from mortality (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord often uses illness to arrest a ruler&#8217;s attention&#8212;consider Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/9-14.htm">Exodus 9:14</a>) and King Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/20-1.htm">2 Kings 20:1</a>). Ben-hadad&#8217;s frailty sets the stage for divine confrontation.<p>&#8226; God orchestrates timing: Elisha arrives exactly when the king is most vulnerable, showcasing the sovereignty we see in <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is in the hand of the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For readers, this links personal weakness to opportunity for grace. Just as Ben-hadad&#8217;s sickness opens the door to God&#8217;s word, so our trials can position us to hear Him (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the king was told, &#8220;The man of God has come here.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The Arameans recognize Elisha&#8217;s title, &#8220;the man of God,&#8221; the same honor the Shunammite woman used (<a href="/2_kings/4-9.htm">2 Kings 4:9</a>). Enemy nations know the prophet represents the living Lord.<p>&#8226; Word spreads quickly through royal corridors, echoing Rahab&#8217;s report: &#8220;We have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10</a>). God ensures His reputation precedes His messenger.<p>&#8226; Notification leads to action. In the following verses Ben-hadad sends Hazael with lavish gifts, seeking Elisha&#8217;s word (<a href="/2_kings/8-8.htm">2 Kings 8:8&#8211;9</a>). It recalls Naaman&#8217;s pilgrimage for healing in chapter 5.<p>&#8226; The pattern is clear:<p>&#8211; Recognition of God&#8217;s servant<p>&#8211; Response of inquiry or submission<p>&#8211; Revelation of God&#8217;s decree.<p>This mirrors Cornelius sending for Peter in <a href="/bsb/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> and the Philippian jailer asking Paul, &#8220;What must I do to be saved?&#8221; (<a href="/acts/16-30.htm">Acts 16:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Elisha&#8217;s presence becomes the hinge on which kingdoms turn; through one obedient prophet the Lord reshapes regional politics (<a href="/2_kings/8-10.htm">2 Kings 8:10&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elisha&#8217;s arrival in Damascus demonstrates God&#8217;s unstoppable purpose: He positions His servant in the very heart of enemy territory at the precise moment the opposing king is laid low, ensuring that His word will penetrate pagan halls and redirect history. The verse teaches that God rules timing, geography, and human frailty; He gives His messenger favor; and He readies even adversaries to hear truth when they are weakest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7-15) Elisha's visit to Damascus, and its consequences.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">And Elisha came to Damascus.</span>--In the fragmentary condition of the narrative, <span class= "ital">why</span> he came is not clear. Rashi suggests that it was to fetch back Gehazi, who had fled to the Syrians (!), an idea based upon <a href="/1_kings/2-39.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants be in Gath.">1Kings 2:39</a>, <span class= "ital">seq</span>. Keil and others think the prophet went with the intention of anointing Hazael, in accordance with a supposed charge of Elijah's. (Comp. <a href="/1_kings/19-15.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when you come, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:">1Kings 19:15</a>, where Elijah himself is bidden to anoint Hazael). Ewald believes that Elisha retreated to Damascene territory, in consequence of the strained relations existing between him and Jehoram, owing to the latter's toleration of idolatry. Obviously all this rests upon pure conjecture. It is clear from <a href="/2_kings/8-7.htm" title="And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come here.">2Kings 8:7</a> that Elisha's visit was not expected in Damascus, and further, that there was peace at the time between Damascus and Samaria. We do not know how much of Elisha's history has been omitted between <a href="/2_kings/7-20.htm" title="And so it fell out to him: for the people stepped on him in the gate, and he died.">2Kings 7:20</a> and <a href="/2_kings/8-7.htm" title="And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come here.">2Kings 8:7</a>; but we may fairly assume that a <span class= "ital">divine impulse</span> led the prophet to Damascus.

It has been usual to connect this visit of Elisha's to Damascus with the commission given to Elijah many years previously, to anoint Hazael to be king over Syria (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>). But it is certainly worthy of remark that neither is Elijah authorized to devolve his corn-mission on another, nor is he said to have done so, nor is there any statement in the present narrative or elsewhere that Elisha anointed Hazael. It is therefore quite possible that Elisha's journey was wholly unconnected with the command given to Elijah. It may, as Ewald imagines, have been the consequence of disorders and dangers in Samaria, growing out of the divergence of views between Jehoram and the queen-mother Jezebel, who still retained considerable influence over the government; and Elisha may have taken his journey, not so much for the sake of a visit, as of a prolonged sojourn. That he attracted the attention both of Benhadad and of his successor Hazael is not surprising. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha came to Damascus.</span> It was a bold step, whatever the circumstances that led to it. Not very long previously the Syrian king had made extraordinary efforts to capture Elisha, intending either to kin him or to keep him confined as a prisoner (<a href="/2_kings/6-18.htm">2 Kings 6:18-19</a>). Elisha had subsequently helped to baffle his plans of conquest, and might be thought to have caused the disgraceful retreat of the Syrian army from the walls of Samaria, which he had certainly prophesied (<a href="/2_kings/7-1.htm">2 Kings 7:1</a>). But Elisha was not afraid. He was probably <span class="accented">commissioned</span> to take his journey, whether its purpose was the anointing of Hazael or no. <span class="cmt_word">And Benhadad the King of Syria was sick.</span> Ewald supposes that this "sickness" was the result of the disgrace and discredit into which he had fallen since his ignominious retreat, without assignable reason, from before the walls of Samaria; but Ben-hadad must have been of an age When the infirmities of nature press in upon a man, and when illness has to be expected. He was a contemporary of Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>), who had now been dead ten or twelve years. <span class="cmt_word">And it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</span> Elisha seems to have attempted no concealment of his presence. No sooner was he arrived than his coming was reported to Benhadad. The Syrians had by this time learnt to give him the name by which he was commonly known (<a href="/2_kings/4-7.htm">2 Kings 4:7, 21, 40</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-6.htm">2 Kings 6:6, 10</a>;
