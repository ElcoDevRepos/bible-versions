This covenant was a binding agreement between God and the Israelites, emphasizing their unique relationship. It required the Israelites to follow God's commandments, and in return, God promised to be their God and bless them. This covenant is foundational to understanding Israel's identity and their obligations to God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-11</a>.<p><b>and commanded them,</b><br>God's commands were not mere suggestions but divine mandates that required obedience. The commandments were given to guide the Israelites in living a life that was pleasing to God and distinct from the surrounding nations. This reflects the holiness and authority of God, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>, where God calls His people to be holy because He is holy.<p><b>&#8220;Do not worship other gods</b><br>This command is rooted in the First Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>), which prohibits idolatry. The worship of other gods was a constant temptation for Israel, as they were surrounded by polytheistic cultures. This command underscores the monotheistic nature of Israel's faith and the exclusivity of their worship to Yahweh. It highlights the spiritual adultery that idolatry represents, as seen in <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>.<p><b>or bow down to them;</b><br>Bowing down is an act of reverence and submission, often associated with worship. This prohibition emphasizes that physical acts of worship, such as bowing, should be directed only to the LORD. The act of bowing to idols is seen as a betrayal of the covenant relationship with God, as illustrated in <a href="/daniel/3-18.htm">Daniel 3:18</a>, where Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refuse to bow to Nebuchadnezzar's image.<p><b>do not serve them</b><br>Serving other gods implies allegiance and devotion, which should be reserved for the LORD alone. This command reflects the call to serve God with all one's heart and soul, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>. Serving idols is portrayed as slavery, contrasting with the freedom found in serving the true God.<p><b>or sacrifice to them.</b><br>Sacrifices were a central part of worship in ancient cultures, symbolizing devotion and appeasement. Offering sacrifices to other gods was strictly forbidden, as it violated the covenant and was an abomination to the LORD. This command is reinforced in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>, where God warns against adopting the detestable practices of the nations. Sacrifices were to be made only to the LORD, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the sacrificial system (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-making God of Israel, who commands exclusive worship and loyalty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, which is the primary audience of this command, often struggling with idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>A solemn agreement between God and His people, emphasizing exclusive worship and obedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/other_gods.htm">Other gods</a></b><br>The false deities of surrounding nations, which Israel was tempted to worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrian_captivity.htm">Assyrian Captivity</a></b><br>The context of this passage, where Israel's disobedience led to their exile by the Assyrians.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/exclusive_worship.htm">Exclusive Worship</a></b><br>God demands exclusive worship and loyalty.

Yet verse 35 first reminds us of the bright beginning: &#8220;For the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; A covenant is far more than a contract; it is a sacred, binding relationship. See <a href="/bsb/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a> and <a href="/bsb/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>, where God pledges Himself to Abraham&#8217;s offspring and later seals the Sinai covenant with blood.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenants always reveal His character&#8212;faithful, steadfast, unchanging (<a href="/psalms/89-34.htm">Psalm 89:34</a>).<p>&#8226; The people&#8217;s duty flowed from God&#8217;s prior grace. As <a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4-6</a> shows, redemption (&#8220;I carried you on eagles&#8217; wings&#8221;) comes before obligation (&#8220;Now if you will indeed obey My voice&#8230;&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and commanded them</b><p>The covenant came with clear commands. Covenant love is not law-less love; it gives direction. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-1.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-3</a> stresses that commands are gifts meant to bless, preserve, and prolong life in the land.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s history proves that ignoring divine commands always leads to disaster (<a href="/judges/2-20.htm">Judges 2:20-23</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The commands are not arbitrary; they safeguard exclusive allegiance to the Lord who alone saves (<a href="/isaiah/43-11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not worship other gods</b><p>Idolatry is the chief covenant violation. The first of the Ten Commandments says, &#8220;You shall have no other gods before Me&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Other gods&#8221; covers everything&#8212;from Baal and Asherah (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>, <a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a>) to the modern idols of power, money, and self (<a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Worship is fundamentally about trust and love. When Israel trusted Baal for rain, they denied the Lord&#8217;s sufficiency (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or bow down to them</b><p>The physical act of bowing signals internal surrender. <a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a> invites us to bow before the LORD alone.<p>&#8226; Bowing also communicates honor; giving that honor elsewhere robs God of glory (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/daniel/3.htm">Daniel 3</a> contrasts faithful refusal to bow before idols with the prevailing cultural pressure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>do not serve them</b><p>Service involves daily allegiance, not just ceremonial acts. Jesus recalls this command in <a href="/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>, &#8220;Worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only,&#8221; fending off Satan&#8217;s temptation.<p>&#8226; Whatever commands our time, energy, and resources becomes our master (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s slide into idolatrous service led to moral decay and social injustice (<a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or sacrifice to them</b><p>Sacrifice expresses ultimate devotion. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13-14</a> stipulates that offerings be made only &#8220;at the place the LORD will choose.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Pagan sacrifices often involved immorality and even child sacrifice (<a href="/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a>), practices the Lord utterly abhors (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>).<p>&#8226; By limiting sacrifice to Himself, God guards both His people&#8217;s purity and His own honor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/17-35.htm">2 Kings 17:35</a> is the covenant&#8217;s heartbeat distilled into one sentence.
