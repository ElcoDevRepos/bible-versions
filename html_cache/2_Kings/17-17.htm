Archaeological evidence from sites like Carthage shows that such practices were not uncommon in the ancient Near East. The Israelites were explicitly forbidden from engaging in this abomination (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>). This act was a direct violation of God's commandments and demonstrated a complete departure from the covenant relationship with Yahweh. The sacrifice of children was seen as the ultimate act of idolatry and rebellion against God, highlighting the depth of Israel's apostasy.<p><b>and practiced divination and soothsaying</b><br>Divination and soothsaying were methods used to predict the future or gain insight through supernatural means, often involving rituals or the consultation of spirits. These practices were common among pagan cultures and were strictly prohibited for the Israelites (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>). The use of divination indicated a reliance on sources other than God for guidance and wisdom, which was considered an act of unfaithfulness. This behavior was akin to spiritual adultery, as it involved seeking power and knowledge from false gods or demonic forces, rather than trusting in the Lord.<p><b>They devoted themselves to doing evil in the sight of the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the intentional and persistent nature of Israel's sin. The people were not merely passive in their wrongdoing; they actively pursued evil, demonstrating a hardened heart and a willful rejection of God's laws. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" emphasizes that their actions were not hidden from God, who is omniscient and sees all. This deliberate rebellion against God's commandments was a breach of the covenant and a direct challenge to His authority and holiness.<p><b>provoking Him to anger</b><br>The provocation of God's anger is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, particularly in the context of Israel's idolatry and disobedience. God's anger is not capricious but is a righteous response to sin and injustice. The Israelites' actions were a direct affront to God's holiness and justice, and their persistent rebellion necessitated divine judgment. This phrase serves as a warning of the consequences of sin and the seriousness with which God views covenant unfaithfulness. It also foreshadows the eventual judgment and exile that would come upon Israel as a result of their continued disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of the Northern Kingdom of Israel who are being addressed in this passage.
