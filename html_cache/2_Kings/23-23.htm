The eighteenth year of his reign is particularly important because it marks a pivotal moment in his efforts to restore true worship in Judah. This year corresponds to approximately 622 BC. During this time, Josiah initiated a major reform after the discovery of the Book of the Law in the temple (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8-13</a>). This discovery led to a renewed commitment to the covenant and a purging of idolatry from the land.<p><b>this Passover was observed</b><br>The Passover is a foundational event in Israel's history, commemorating their deliverance from slavery in Egypt (Exodus 12). It is a time of remembrance and celebration of God's salvation and faithfulness. Josiah's observance of the Passover is significant because it had not been celebrated in such a manner since the days of the judges (<a href="/2_kings/23-22.htm">2 Kings 23:22</a>). This observance was a return to the covenantal practices commanded in the Law, highlighting Josiah's dedication to following God's commands.<p><b>to the LORD</b><br>The Passover was observed to honor the LORD, the covenant God of Israel. This phrase emphasizes the focus on worshiping Yahweh alone, in contrast to the idolatrous practices that had infiltrated Judah. Josiah's reforms were aimed at restoring exclusive worship of the LORD, aligning with the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This dedication to the LORD is a central theme in the narrative of Josiah's reign.<p><b>in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital of Judah and the location of the temple, was the central place of worship for the Israelites. The observance of the Passover in Jerusalem underscores the importance of the temple as the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. It also fulfills the command that the Passover should be celebrated at the place the LORD would choose (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-5.htm">Deuteronomy 16:5-6</a>). This centralization of worship in Jerusalem was part of Josiah's efforts to unify the nation under the true worship of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who initiated significant religious reforms, including the restoration of the Passover celebration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, which Josiah reinstated according to the Law of Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah and the central place of worship where the Passover was observed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/eighteenth_year_of_josiah's_reign.htm">Eighteenth Year of Josiah's Reign</a></b><br>Marks the specific time when Josiah's reforms were implemented, highlighting his commitment to restoring true worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, to whom the Passover was dedicated, emphasizing the renewal of the people's relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_god's_word.htm">Commitment to God's Word</a></b><br>Josiah's actions demonstrate the importance of aligning our lives with Scripture, even when it requires significant change.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/revival_and_reform.htm">Revival and Reform</a></b><br>True revival often involves returning to foundational truths and practices, as seen in Josiah's restoration of the Passover.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_in_worship.htm">Leadership in Worship</a></b><br>Josiah's leadership in reinstating the Passover shows the impact of godly leadership in guiding others toward faithful worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_renewal.htm">Covenant Renewal</a></b><br>Observing the Passover was a renewal of the covenant relationship with God, reminding us of the importance of regularly renewing our commitment to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_faithfulness.htm">Historical Faithfulness</a></b><br>Understanding the historical context of our faith can deepen our appreciation and commitment to God's ongoing work in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_23_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 23:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_23_23_Passover_s_lasting_value.htm">How does 2 Kings 23:23 emphasize the importance of observing the Passover today?
