Jezreel was a significant city in the northern kingdom, serving as a royal residence and military stronghold. The return to Jezreel indicates a strategic retreat to a place of safety and recuperation. Jezreel's location in the fertile valley made it a desirable place for a king to recover.<p><b>to recover from the wounds he had suffered</b><br>Joram's wounds were a result of conflict, highlighting the constant state of warfare during this period. The injuries suggest a significant battle, reflecting the turbulent times in Israel's history. The need for recovery underscores the severity of his injuries, which may have weakened his rule and created an opportunity for political upheaval.<p><b>at the hands of the Arameans</b><br>The Arameans, originating from modern-day Syria, were frequent adversaries of Israel. Their conflicts with Israel are well-documented throughout the Old Testament, often serving as instruments of divine judgment against Israel's unfaithfulness. The Arameans' military prowess was a constant threat to Israel's stability.<p><b>in the battle against Hazael their king.</b><br>Hazael was a formidable king of Aram, known for his aggressive expansion and military campaigns. His rise to power was prophesied by Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12-13</a>), and he became a significant adversary to Israel. The battle against Hazael represents the ongoing struggle between Israel and its neighbors, often seen as a consequence of Israel's disobedience to God.<p><b>So Jehu said, &#8220;If you commanders wish to make me king,</b><br>Jehu, a commander in Israel's army, was anointed by a prophet sent by Elisha to become king (<a href="/2_kings/9.htm">2 Kings 9:1-6</a>). His statement to the commanders indicates a coup, a common method of regime change in ancient times. The support of military leaders was crucial for Jehu's success, reflecting the importance of military power in political transitions.<p><b>then do not let anyone escape from the city</b><br>Jehu's command to prevent anyone from escaping the city underscores the need for secrecy and surprise in his plan to seize the throne. Controlling information was vital to ensure the success of his coup, preventing Joram from receiving any warning or preparing a defense.<p><b>to go and tell it in Jezreel.&#8221;</b><br>Jezreel, where Joram was recovering, was the target of Jehu's coup. Preventing news from reaching Jezreel was crucial to maintain the element of surprise. This strategic move highlights the importance of communication and intelligence in ancient warfare and political maneuvers. Jehu's actions were in fulfillment of divine prophecy, as he was chosen to execute judgment on the house of Ahab (<a href="/2_kings/9-7.htm">2 Kings 9:7-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places

The detail underscores:<p>&#8226; The certainty of God&#8217;s word&#8212;what the Lord decreed is already unfolding.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s misplaced alliances&#8212;though once allied (<a href="/1_kings/22-2.htm">1 Kings 22:2-4</a>), Aram now brings pain.<p>&#8226; Joram&#8217;s physical frailty mirroring Israel&#8217;s spiritual frailty (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So Jehu said, &#8220;If you commanders wish to make me king,&#8221;</b><p>Jehu has just been anointed (<a href="/2_kings/9-1.htm">2 Kings 9:1-13</a>). He appeals to the captains&#8217; choice, but the decision is ultimately God-ordained (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>). Within the camp:<p>&#8226; The captains&#8217; swift agreement (<a href="/2_kings/9-13.htm">2 Kings 9:13</a>) shows military momentum behind Jehu.<p>&#8226; Their response echoes earlier transitions where loyal officers installed God&#8217;s chosen leader (<a href="/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38-40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>then do not let anyone escape from the city to go and tell it in Jezreel</b><p>Jehu&#8217;s first royal order is one of secrecy.

Joram&#8217;s return to Jezreel exposes his vulnerability; Jehu&#8217;s command ensures the news stays contained until God&#8217;s chosen instrument can act. The verse highlights the reliability of God&#8217;s word, the strategic obedience of Jehu, and the unfolding of divine justice in real history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">If it be your minds.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">if it be your soul</span>; some MSS., "if it be with your soul," as in <a href="/genesis/23-8.htm" title="And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,">Genesis 23:8</a>.

Secrecy was absolutely essential. If the revolt had got wind - and a single messenger might have carried the news - the whole attempt might have failed, or only have succeeded after a long and bloody civil war. All John's efforts were bent on keeping his revolt secret until he himself announced it to the astonished king (see ver. 22). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/9-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1436;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
