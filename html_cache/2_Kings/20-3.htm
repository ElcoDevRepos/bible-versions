In the context of ancient Israel, walking before God signifies living a life in accordance with His commandments and maintaining a covenant relationship. Hezekiah's reign is noted for religious reforms, including the removal of high places and the restoration of temple worship (<a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3-6</a>). This phrase underscores the importance of faithfulness in leadership and personal conduct, echoing the covenantal language found in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a>.<p><b>and with wholehearted devotion;</b><br>Wholehearted devotion indicates a complete and undivided commitment to God, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. This reflects the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. Hezekiah's reforms and his trust in God during the Assyrian siege (2 Kings 19) exemplify this devotion. The cultural context of the time often involved syncretism, but Hezekiah's singular focus on Yahweh set him apart as a model of true worship.<p><b>I have done what is good in Your sight.</b><br>This phrase highlights Hezekiah's adherence to God's standards, contrasting with many of his predecessors who did evil in the sight of the LORD. The biblical narrative often evaluates kings based on their faithfulness to God's law. Hezekiah's actions, such as the destruction of the bronze serpent (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>), align with the prophetic call to justice and righteousness found in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. His life serves as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the will of the Father (<a href="/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>).<p><b>And Hezekiah wept bitterly.</b><br>Hezekiah's tears reflect the human response to impending death and the desire for divine intervention. In the ancient Near East, weeping was a common expression of grief and supplication. This moment of vulnerability reveals the depth of Hezekiah's faith and his reliance on God's mercy. The narrative parallels other biblical figures who wept in prayer, such as Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10</a>) and Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/luke/22-44.htm">Luke 22:44</a>), illustrating the power of earnest prayer in times of distress.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to restore proper worship in the temple.

This highlights the biblical theme that God is attentive to the lives of His people and remembers their faithfulness and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/emotional_honesty_with_god.htm">Emotional Honesty with God</a></b><br>Hezekiah's bitter weeping shows that it is acceptable to express deep emotions before God.

Hezekiah is conscious that he has honestly endeavored to serve God, and to do his will - that, whatever may have been his shortcomings, his heart has been right towards God. He ventures, therefore, on something like expostulation. Why is he to be cut off in the midst of his days, at the age of thirty-nine, when such a wicked king as Uzziah has lived to be sixty-eight (<a href="/2_kings/15-2.htm">2 Kings 15:2</a>), and Rehoboam to be fifty-eight (<a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>)? It is to be remembered that, under the old covenant, length of days was expressly promised to the righteous (<a href="/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-11.htm">Proverbs 9:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>, etc.), and that a shortened life was the proclaimed penalty of wicked-doing (<a href="/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32, 33</a>; <a href="/job/22-16.htm">Job 22:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>). Hezekiah's self-assertion is thus a sort of laying hold of God's promises. <span class="cmt_word">And have done that which is flood in thy sight</span>; comp. <a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3-6</a>; and note the similar pleadings of David, "<span class="accented">With my whole heart</span> have I sought thee" (<a href="/psalms/119-10.htm">Psalm 119:10</a>); "I have remembered thy Name, O Lord, and have <span class="accented">kept thy Law</span>. <span class="accented">This</span> I had because I kept thy commandments" (<a href="/psalms/119-55.htm">Psalm 119:55, 56</a>), and the like. <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah wept sore.</span> Human nature shrinks from death instinctively, and it requires a very vivid imagination for even the Christian in middle life to feel with St. Paul, that "it is better for him to depart and to be with Christ." The Hebrew of Hezekiah's time had far mere reason to regard death as an evil. His hopes of a life beyond the grave were feeble - his conceptions of the life, if life there were, faint and unattractive. <span class="accented">Sheol</span>, like Hades, was a vague, awful, terrible thing. If we consider Hezekiah's words, "The grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. The living, the living, he shall praise thee" (<a href="/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18, 19</a>), we may understand how the Hebrew shrank from the fearful change. And in Hezekiah's case there was a yet further reason for grief Hezekiah had as yet no male offspring (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,'10:2. &sect; 1). Manasseh was as yet unborn (comp. ver. 6 with <a href="/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>). If he died now, his house would be cut off, he would be without posterity - a sore grief to every Hebrew. Ewald's references to <a href="/isaiah/38-19.htm">Isaiah 38:19</a> and Isaiah 39:7, as indicative of Hezekiah having sons at the time, are absolutely without value. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/20-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Please,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;n&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_577.htm">Strong's 577: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ah, now!
