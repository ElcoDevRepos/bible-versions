The command to "lift it out" demonstrates Elisha's authority and the power of God working through him. In the biblical context, prophets often acted as intermediaries between God and the people, and their words carried divine authority. This miracle is a testament to God's concern for the everyday needs of His people, as the axe head was borrowed and valuable. The act of lifting it out signifies human participation in God's miraculous provision, emphasizing the cooperation between divine power and human action.<p><b>and the man reached out his hand</b><br>The man referred to here is one of the sons of the prophets, a group of men who were being trained under Elisha. This action of reaching out his hand signifies faith and obedience. In biblical narratives, physical actions often symbolize spiritual truths. The man's willingness to reach out demonstrates trust in the prophet's words and, by extension, in God's power. This mirrors other biblical instances where faith is demonstrated through action, such as Peter walking on water (<a href="/matthew/14-29.htm">Matthew 14:29</a>) or the woman with the issue of blood reaching out to touch Jesus' garment (<a href="/mark/5-27.htm">Mark 5:27-28</a>).<p><b>and took it.</b><br>The act of taking the axe head completes the miracle and restores what was lost. This can be seen as a metaphor for restoration and redemption, themes prevalent throughout the Bible. The recovery of the axe head can be likened to the restoration of what is lost through sin, with God providing a means for recovery. This also prefigures the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who restores humanity to God. The simplicity of the act&#8212;reaching out and taking&#8212;parallels the simplicity of receiving God's grace through faith. This narrative underscores the importance of human response to divine initiative, a recurring theme in Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah.
