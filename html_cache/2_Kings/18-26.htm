Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, was the palace administrator, a position of significant authority and responsibility. Shebnah, initially the royal secretary, is later demoted, indicating possible political shifts or divine disfavor. Joah, the recorder, was responsible for chronicling events, highlighting the importance of this encounter. The Rabshakeh was an Assyrian military officer, likely a high-ranking official, sent by King Sennacherib to negotiate or intimidate. This meeting underscores the political tension and the threat Judah faced from the powerful Assyrian empire.<p><b>&#8220;Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it.</b><br>Aramaic was the diplomatic and trade language of the Near East, understood by educated officials but not by the common people. The request to use Aramaic indicates the officials' desire to keep the conversation private, avoiding panic among the people. This reflects the broader cultural and linguistic landscape of the region, where Aramaic served as a lingua franca. The use of Aramaic also highlights the officials' education and their attempt to manage the situation diplomatically.<p><b>Do not speak with us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.&#8221;</b><br>Hebrew was the language of the people of Judah, and speaking in Hebrew would make the conversation accessible to the common citizens. The officials' request to avoid Hebrew suggests their concern about maintaining morale and preventing fear or rebellion among the populace. The people on the wall likely included soldiers and citizens who would be directly affected by the Assyrian threat. This phrase illustrates the tension between transparency and control in leadership, as well as the psychological warfare employed by the Assyrians to undermine confidence in Hezekiah's leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliakim_son_of_hilkiah.htm">Eliakim son of Hilkiah</a></b><br>A high-ranking official in King Hezekiah's court, serving as the palace administrator.

Hebrew, Aramaic, and Assyrian were three cognate languages, closely allied, and very similar both in their grammatical forms and in their vocabularies, but still sufficiently different to be distinct languages, which were only intelligible to those who had learnt them. Rabshakeh had addressed the Jewish officials in Hebrew, probably as the language which they would best understand, if it were not even the only one that they would understand; not with the express "object of influencing the common people," as Bahr supposes. But the Jewish officials feared that the words uttered were influencing them. They proposed, therefore, that the further negotiations should be conducted in Aramaic, a tongue which they understood, and one which they supposed that Rabshakeh, as he knew Hebrew, would also know. Aramaic was spoken in most of the tract that lay between Assyria and Palestine, in Syria and Damascus certainly, in Upper Mesopotamia, along the line of the Euphrates, and perhaps as far as the Khabour river. <span class="cmt_word">For we understand it.</span> It is not likely that the Jews of this time generally understood Aramaic; but high officials of the court, who might have to deal with embassies and negotiate treaties, found it necessary to understand it, just as such persons in our own country have to know French. <span class="cmt_word">And talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.</span> Besides the sentinels and other soldiers, there would probably be many idlers upon the wall, attracted by the unwonted spectacle of an ambassadorial <span class="accented">cortege</span>, and anxious to pick up intelligence.
