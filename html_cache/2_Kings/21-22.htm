The abandonment of the LORD by King Manasseh, as described in this passage, reflects a broader pattern of apostasy that plagued the nation. This act of forsaking God is significant because it highlights the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where faithfulness was expected. The consequences of such abandonment were severe, often leading to divine judgment and national calamity, as seen in the eventual Babylonian exile.<p><b>the God of his fathers</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continuity of faith that was supposed to be maintained from generation to generation. The "God of his fathers" refers to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, underscoring the historical and covenantal relationship that God had with the patriarchs and their descendants. This highlights the importance of generational faithfulness and the responsibility of each generation to uphold the covenant. The failure to do so, as in the case of Manasseh, often led to spiritual decline and idolatry.<p><b>and did not walk in the way of the LORD</b><br>Walking in the way of the LORD implies living according to God's commandments and statutes. This phrase suggests a lifestyle and conduct that align with God's will, as outlined in the Torah. The failure to walk in God's way indicates a rejection of His laws and a preference for idolatrous practices, which were prevalent during Manasseh's reign. This deviation from God's path is contrasted with the righteous kings of Judah, such as Hezekiah, who sought to restore true worship. The concept of walking in God's way is echoed throughout Scripture, including in the teachings of Jesus, who called His followers to a life of obedience and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is the subject of this verse.

The &#8220;he&#8221; is King Amon of Judah, whose two-year reign followed the long but infamous rule of his father Manasseh. To abandon the LORD is not a momentary lapse; it is a deliberate, ongoing decision to turn away from the covenant-keeping God.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-22.htm">2 Chronicles 33:22</a> parallels this charge, noting that Amon &#8220;did evil&#8230; just as his father Manasseh had done.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Earlier generations had been warned that &#8220;if you forsake the LORD, He will forsake you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-20.htm">Joshua 24:20</a>). Amon&#8217;s choice therefore rejects centuries of clear revelation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15-16</a> shows the pattern: &#8220;They rejected His statutes&#8230; and followed worthless idols.&#8221; Amon steps into the same tragic storyline.<p>By deserting the LORD, Amon forfeits the protection, wisdom, and blessing God had pledged to the house of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the God of his fathers</b><p>The same verse stresses that Amon abandoned &#8220;the God of his fathers.&#8221; Scripture purposely highlights the family legacy he spurned.<p>&#8226; David, Solomon, Jehoshaphat, and Hezekiah all trusted this God (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-6.htm">2 Chronicles 20:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5</a>). Amon&#8217;s apostasy is therefore a personal and public betrayal.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/22-4.htm">Psalm 22:4-5</a> recalls, &#8220;In You our fathers trusted; they trusted and You delivered them.&#8221; Amon&#8217;s refusal to follow that trust breaks the generational chain of faith.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant is relational and historical; when one generation abandons Him, it endangers the next (<a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>). Amon&#8217;s son Josiah will eventually reverse course, but only after Judah absorbs more spiritual damage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and did not walk in the way of the LORD</b><p>To &#8220;walk&#8221; is the Bible&#8217;s everyday picture of lifestyle and direction. Amon&#8217;s path diverged completely from God&#8217;s revealed way.<p>&#8226; God told Solomon, &#8220;Walk in My ways&#8230; that I may prolong your days&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>). Amon ignores that condition.<p>&#8226; <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a> sums up the divine expectation: &#8220;to walk humbly with your God.&#8221; Instead, Amon promoted the idols his father had set up, multiplying guilt (<a href="/2_kings/21-21.htm">2 Kings 21:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Where Hezekiah &#8220;walked before You in truth&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/20-3.htm">2 Kings 20:3</a>) and Josiah will later &#8220;walk in all the way of David his father&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/22-2.htm">2 Kings 22:2</a>), Amon charts the opposite route&#8212;leading swiftly to assassination and national instability (<a href="/2_kings/21-23.htm">2 Kings 21:23-24</a>).<p>Disobedience is never neutral; it shapes the heart and influences the nation. Refusing God&#8217;s path invites discipline and, eventually, exile (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13, 19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/21-22.htm">2 Kings 21:22</a> records more than a royal misstep; it marks a conscious, catastrophic severing of covenant ties. Amon abandons the LORD, rejects the God who proved faithful to his ancestors, and chooses a life that flaunts divine standards. The verse warns that heritage cannot save anyone who refuses personal obedience, and it underscores the sobering reality that turning from God always leads away from blessing and toward judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">And he forsook the Lord</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span><span class= "ital">--And he forsook Jehovah, the God of his fathers;</span> abandoned his worship altogether, and gave himself up to foreign superstitions which his father had introduced. It is noteworthy that the long reign of Manasseh-Amon is described by the sacred historian simply on the side of its relation to the religion of Israel. The astonishing corruption of worship which broke out during this period; the perverted hankering after foreign rites, which appears to have been only intensified by the restraints endured under Hezekiah; the bloody persecution of those who maintained the ancient faith; the prophetic menaces of coming retribution--such are the main points of the brief but impressive story. As usual, moral and religious license went hand in hand. The prophet Zephaniah denounces all the ruling classes of "the rebellious and polluted city;" princes and judges, prophets and priests, are involved in the same condemnation (<a href="/context/zephaniah/1-4.htm" title="I will also stretch out my hand on Judah, and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;">Zephaniah 1:4-5</a>; <a href="/context/zephaniah/3-1.htm" title="Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!">Zephaniah 3:1-4</a>; comp. <a href="/micah/6-10.htm" title="Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?">Micah 6:10</a> <span class= "ital">seq.,</span> <a href="/context/micah/7-2.htm" title="The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.">Micah 7:2-6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he forsook the Lord God of his fathers.</span> Other kings, as Ahaz, had made a sort of compromise between the worship of Jehovah and idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10-15</a>).
