The promise of land is a central theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing God's covenant and faithfulness. Historically, the Israelites' wandering in the wilderness for 40 years was a result of disobedience and lack of faith (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>). The assurance of a permanent dwelling place is contingent upon their obedience, highlighting the conditional nature of many of God's promises in the Old Testament.<p><b>if only they are careful to do all I have commanded them</b><br>This condition emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's commandments as a prerequisite for receiving His blessings. The phrase underscores the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings are tied to adherence to His laws. This reflects the Deuteronomic theology, where obedience leads to blessing and disobedience to curse (Deuteronomy 28). It also points to the broader biblical theme of faithfulness and the human responsibility to uphold God's statutes.<p><b>the whole Law that My servant Moses commanded them</b><br>The reference to "the whole Law" indicates the comprehensive nature of the Torah, which includes moral, ceremonial, and civil laws given through Moses. Moses, as God's servant, is a central figure in delivering the Law, which is foundational to Israel's identity and relationship with God. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative where the Law serves as a tutor leading to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>), who fulfills the Law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The emphasis on the entirety of the Law highlights the need for complete obedience, not selective adherence, to maintain the covenant relationship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were given the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, Canaan, which God gave to the Israelites as an inheritance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The servant of God who led the Israelites out of Egypt and through whom God gave the Law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>The commandments and instructions given by God to the Israelites through Moses, including moral, ceremonial, and civil laws.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_promise.htm">God's Promise</a></b><br>The conditional promise of God to keep the Israelites in the land if they obey His commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/conditional_promises.htm">Conditional Promises</a></b><br>God's promises often come with conditions.

The verse in 21:8 therefore underlines both His gracious intention and His sovereign right to discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the land that I gave to their fathers</b><p>The land is repeatedly called a gift, never a human achievement.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15 and 26</a>:3 trace this gift back to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-8.htm">Deuteronomy 1:8</a> reminds the new generation that the land &#8220;sworn to your fathers&#8221; is now set before them.<p>&#8226; By anchoring the promise in what He &#8220;gave,&#8221; God highlights His faithfulness across centuries; the Israelites&#8217; security rests on His unchanging covenant character, not on their military might or political alliances (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if only they are careful to do all I have commanded them</b><p>Here is the covenant condition. God&#8217;s &#8220;never again&#8221; is tied to Israel&#8217;s &#8220;careful&#8221; obedience.<p>&#8226; The same wording appears in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1&#8211;2</a>, where blessing hinges on diligent obedience.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/2-3.htm">1 Kings 2:3</a> records David charging Solomon to &#8220;walk in His ways&#8230; so that you may prosper,&#8221; showing how covenant obedience is the path to stability for leaders and nation alike.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;careful to do&#8221; stresses intentional, wholehearted devotion rather than sporadic or selective observance (cf. <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> for the timeless call to be doers of the word).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the whole Law that My servant Moses commanded them</b><p>Partial obedience will not safeguard the nation; God calls for comprehensive allegiance.<p>&#8226; <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7&#8211;8</a> urges meditation on and adherence to &#8220;all the Law&#8221; for success and courage.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13</a> chronicles the prophets&#8217; repeated plea: &#8220;Turn from your evil ways and keep My commandments&#8230; according to all the Law.&#8221; Israel&#8217;s downfall came when they treated God&#8217;s standard as negotiable.<p>&#8226; By naming Moses, God connects the current generation to Sinai, underscoring continuity: the statutes spoken centuries earlier still govern their life in the land.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/21-8.htm">2 Kings 21:8</a> sets forth a gracious, conditional promise: God intends permanent rest in the land for His people, but that rest is inseparable from wholehearted obedience to the entire Mosaic Law. The verse affirms His covenant faithfulness (&#8220;the land that I gave to their fathers&#8221;) while making clear that ongoing blessing requires ongoing submission. In the broader chapter, Manasseh&#8217;s rebellion shows how ignoring this condition invites judgment. For every generation, the takeaway is the same: God delights to secure His people, yet He calls them to walk faithfully so that His promised rest may be enjoyed without interruption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Neither will I make the feet</span> <span class= "ital"><span class= "bld">(foot</span>)<span class= "ital"></span></span> <span class= "bld">of Israel move</span> (<span class= "ital">wander</span>) <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Comp. the promise in <a href="/2_samuel/7-10.htm" title="Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,">2Samuel 7:10</a>.

The promises of permanence to the city and temple, and of the continued possession of the laud by the people, were, he notes, conditional; and Manasseh, by breaking through the conditions, forfeited them (comp. <a href="/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all that my servant Moses commanded them.</span> The words are not taken from any single passage, but express the general sense of numerous passages, as for example of <a href="/deuteronomy/4-25.htm">Deuteronomy 4:25-27</a>;
