Historically, these customs often included idolatry, child sacrifice, and other practices detestable to the LORD. The Israelites were explicitly warned against such assimilation in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-12</a>, where God commands them not to imitate the detestable ways of the nations they were to dispossess.<p><b>that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites</b><br>This refers to the Canaanite nations that God had previously expelled from the land to make way for the Israelites. The conquest of Canaan, as described in the book of Joshua, was a divine judgment against the Canaanites for their wickedness. The Israelites' adoption of these customs is seen as a reversal of God's intended order and a failure to remain distinct as His chosen people.<p><b>as well as in the practices introduced by the kings of Israel</b><br>The kings of Israel, particularly from the northern kingdom, often led the people into idolatry and syncretism. Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom, set up golden calves in Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>) to prevent his people from worshiping in Jerusalem. This set a precedent for subsequent kings, who continued to introduce and endorse practices contrary to the worship of Yahweh.

A certain number, however, came in from a different source, being imposed upon the people by their kings. To this class belong the desertion of the temple-worship, enforced by Jeroboam (vex. 21), the setting up of the calves at Dan and Bethel (ver. 16) by the same, and the Baal and <span class="accented">Astarte</span> worship (ver. 16), introduced by Ahab.
