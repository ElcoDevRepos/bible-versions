The king of Israel's decision to prepare a feast for the Aramean soldiers, who were previously enemies, reflects a profound act of mercy and grace. This act can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Testament teaching to love one's enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>). The feast symbolizes a covenant of peace, reminiscent of the peace offerings in <a href="/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a>.<p><b>and after they had finished eating and drinking</b><br>The completion of the meal signifies the fulfillment of the king's gesture of goodwill. In biblical times, eating and drinking together often sealed agreements and covenants. This act of sharing a meal can be compared to the Last Supper, where Jesus shared bread and wine with His disciples, symbolizing the new covenant (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19-20</a>).<p><b>he sent them away</b><br>Sending the Aramean soldiers away unharmed demonstrates a strategic and compassionate approach to conflict resolution. This action aligns with the biblical principle of overcoming evil with good (<a href="/romans/12-21.htm">Romans 12:21</a>). It also reflects the wisdom of <a href="/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21-22</a>, which advises feeding one's enemy and offering them drink, thereby heaping burning coals on their head, a metaphor for inducing shame and repentance.<p><b>and they returned to their master</b><br>The return of the soldiers to their master, the king of Aram, signifies the restoration of order and the cessation of hostilities. This return can be seen as a type of repentance or turning back, which is a recurring theme in the Bible. It also highlights the sovereignty of God in orchestrating peace between nations, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, where the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord.<p><b>And the Aramean raiders did not come into the land of Israel again</b><br>This outcome underscores the effectiveness of the king's merciful actions. The cessation of raids can be viewed as a divine intervention, where God grants peace to Israel as a result of their obedience and faithfulness. This mirrors the promise of protection and peace found in <a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>, where God assures Israel of safety if they follow His statutes. The peace achieved here is a temporary glimpse of the ultimate peace that will be established in the Messianic kingdom, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>The prophet of God who plays a central role in this account, demonstrating God's power and mercy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>The unnamed king who follows Elisha's counsel to show mercy to the captured Aramean soldiers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aramean_raiders.htm">Aramean Raiders</a></b><br>The enemy soldiers who were captured and then released by the Israelites, leading to a cessation of their raids.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, where the events take place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast.htm">The Feast</a></b><br>A significant event where the captured enemies are treated with kindness, symbolizing mercy and grace.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/mercy_over_retribution.htm">Mercy Over Retribution</a></b><br>The account highlights the power of mercy over vengeance.
