The events occur during the reign of Hezekiah, king of Judah, after his miraculous recovery from a life-threatening illness. This period is marked by political upheaval and shifting alliances in the ancient Near East.<p><b>Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon</b><br>Merodach-baladan was a historical figure known for his opposition to Assyrian dominance. He ruled Babylon intermittently and was a significant political player. His name, meaning "Marduk has given a son," reflects the Babylonian practice of naming individuals after their gods. His interactions with Hezekiah highlight the geopolitical tensions of the time, as Babylon sought allies against Assyria.<p><b>sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah</b><br>The sending of letters and gifts was a common diplomatic practice in the ancient world, often used to establish or strengthen alliances. This gesture from Merodach-baladan could be seen as an attempt to court Hezekiah's favor and possibly secure Judah as an ally against Assyria. The gifts may have been intended to flatter Hezekiah and express goodwill.<p><b>for he had heard about Hezekiah&#8217;s illness</b><br>Hezekiah's illness and subsequent recovery were well-known events, possibly due to their miraculous nature. The news of his recovery would have spread quickly, especially given the political significance of a king's health. This phrase suggests that Merodach-baladan's actions were motivated by the news of Hezekiah's illness, possibly seeing an opportunity to engage with a king who had experienced divine intervention. This also sets the stage for the subsequent events where Hezekiah's pride leads to a prophetic warning about Babylonian captivity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/merodach-baladan.htm">Merodach-baladan</a></b><br>He was the son of Baladan and the king of Babylon.

God had just proven His power over sickness and time; now international attention follows (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-24.htm">2 Chronicles 32:24-26</a>).<p>&#8226; The timing reminds us that public blessings often attract outside interest&#8212;sometimes sincere, sometimes self-serving (cf. <a href="/acts/8-18.htm">Acts 8:18-19</a>, where Simon notices apostolic power).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon</b><p>&#8226; This ruler was a real historical figure who opposed Assyria and sought allies. His appearance underscores that the Bible records genuine history, not myth.<p>&#8226; Babylon was rising but still under Assyrian pressure (<a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>). By naming both the king and his father, the verse roots the narrative in verifiable lineage, echoing the precision found in genealogies such as <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-17</a>.<p>&#8226; The visit signals a shift: Judah is now catching the eye of world powers.

Babylon likely wanted Judah&#8217;s allegiance against Assyria (<a href="/isaiah/39-6.htm">Isaiah 39:6-7</a> reveals the consequence).<p>&#8226; Hezekiah&#8217;s reception of the envoys foreshadows his misplaced trust in foreign prestige rather than in the Lord alone (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>).<p>&#8226; God allows this interaction to test Hezekiah&#8217;s heart after healing him (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for he had heard about Hezekiah&#8217;s illness</b><p>&#8226; News traveled quickly when God intervened so publicly.

The same contrast appears in <a href="/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26</a>, where crowds pursue Jesus for bread rather than truth.<p>&#8226; Hezekiah faced a fresh challenge: would he glorify God before these visitors or showcase his own achievements?

Above all, the cuneiform inscriptions present <span class= "ital">Marduk</span> (or, <span class= "ital">Maruduk</span>)<span class= "ital">-abla-iddina</span> ("Me-rodaeh gave a son"). A king of this name occupied the throne of Chaldea at intervals, during the reigns of the four Assyrian sovereigns Tiglath Pileser, Shalma-neser, Sargon, and Sennacherib. He is called in the inscriptions "son of Yakin," an expression which, like "Jehu son of Omri," is territorial rather than genealogical. <span class= "ital">Bit- Yakin</span> was the name of the tribal domain of the "sons of Yakin," just as <span class= "ital">Bit-Humria</span> was that of the territory of which Jehu was king.

In the first year of Sargon, Merodach-baladan established himself as king of Babylon, and was eventually recognised as such by the Assyrian sovereign. He reigned about twelve years contemporaneously with Sargon, who in 710 and 709 B.C. defeated and captured him, and burnt his stronghold <span class= "ital">D-r-Yakin.</span> On the death of Sargon, Merodach-baladan once more gained possession of the throne of Babylon; and perhaps it was at this time (so Schrader) that he sent his famous embassy to seek the alliance of Hezekiah and other western princes. After a brief reign of six months, he was defeated by Sennacherib, and driven back to his old refuge in the morasses of South Chaldea. Belibus was made Assyrian viceroy of Babylon. These events belong to the beginning of Sennacherib's reign. (He says, <span class= "ital">ina ris sarrutiya,</span> "in the beginning of my sovereignty.") There was yet another outbreak before Merodach-bala-dan was finally disheartened; and later still Esarhaddon mentions that he slew <span class= "ital">Nabu-zir-napisti-sutesir,</span> son of Mardak-abla-iddina, and made his brother <span class= "ital">Na'id-Maruduk</span> king of "the land of the sea" in his stead.<p><span class= "bld">Son of Baladan.</span>--The name of Merodach-baladan's father is not mentioned in the cuneiform inscriptions.<p><span class= "bld">He had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</span>--The ostensible business of the embassy was to congratulate Hezekiah on his recovery, and to inquire about the sign that had been vouchsafed him (sec <a href="/2_chronicles/32-31.htm" title="However, in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.">2Chronicles 32:31</a>, and Note); but the Assyrian records make it pretty clear that the real object was to ascertain the extent of Hezekiah's resources, and to secure his alliance against the common enemy. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-19.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">embassy of Merodach-Baladan</span>. Soon after his recovery, Hezekiah received an embassy from a new quarter. Hitherto Babylon and Judaea had been isolated from one another, and had perhaps scarcely known of each other's existence. Assyria had stood between them, and Babylonia had been for the most part an Assyrian dependency. But recently Babylonia had asserted herself. In <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, on the death of Shalmaneser, a native Chaldean named Meredach-Baladan had made himself king of the country, and maintained his independence against all the efforts of Sargon to reduce him. His position, however, was precarious, and it was probably in the hope of concluding an alliance with Hezekiah also an enemy of Sargon's (see the comment on ver. 6) - that he sent his embassy. He had two excuses for it. A neighboring king might well congratulate his brother monarch on his recovery; and a Chaldean prince might well inquire into an astronomical marvel (2 Chronicles 33:31). The date of the embassy appears to have been <span class="date">B.C. 712</span>, the year following on Hezekiah's illness. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time Berodach-Baladan.</span> Isaiah gives the name more correctly as "Merodach-Baladan" (<a href="/isaiah/39-1.htm">Isaiah 39:1</a>). The native form is Marduk-pal-iddin, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Mere-dacha son has given." This king makes his first appearance in an inscription of Tiglath-pileser's, where he is one of many chieftains among whom Babylonia is divided. Subsequently he is mentioned as revolting from Sargon in the latter's first year, <span class="date">B.C. 722</span> ('Records of the Past,' vol. 7. p. 29), and holding the throne of Babylon for twelve years (ibid., p. 41), when Sargon conquered him, deposed him, and took the kingdom (ibid., p. 48). This twelve-years' reign is acknowledged by Ptolemy in his Canon, but the name of the king is given as Mardoc-Empadus. On the death of Sargon, in <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>, Merodach-Baladan again revolted, and reigned for six months, when he was driven out of the country by Sennacherib, <span class="date">B.C. 704</span>. He continued, however, to give trouble even after this ('Records of the Past,' vol. 7. p. 63); and his sons and grandsons were pretenders to the Babylonian throne in the reigns of Esar-haddon and his successor, Asshur-bani-pal (see 'Ancient Monarchias,' vol. 2. pp. 469 and 490). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Baladan.</span> In the Assyrian inscriptions Merodach-Baladan is always called "the son of Yakin" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 7. p. 40; vol. 9. p. 13, etc.). Yakin, however, may have been his grandfather, as Nimshi was the grandfather of Jehu, and Baladan (Bel-dash?) his father. <span class="cmt_word">King of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah.</span> Thus opening diplomatic communication. It has been almost universally felt that the object of the embassy must have been to conclude, or at any rate to pave the way for, an alliance. So Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:2. &sect; 2), Ewald, Von Gerlach, Thenius, Keil, Bahr, and others. Assyria menaced both countries, and the common danger produced naturally a mutual attraction. But it was prudent to disguise this motive. <span class="cmt_word">For he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</span> Assyria could not take umbrage at an embassy of congratulation, nor at one for scientific purposes (2 Chronicles 33:31). So these two objects were paraded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/20-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1460;&#1441;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Pronoun -
