The rejection is a culmination of persistent idolatry and disobedience to God's covenant, as detailed in the preceding chapters. Historically, this refers to the period leading up to the Assyrian conquest in 722 BC. Theologically, it reflects the consequences of breaking the covenant established at Sinai (Exodus 19-24). The rejection is not merely a temporary punishment but a severing of the special relationship, echoing the warnings given by prophets like Hosea and Amos.<p><b>He afflicted them</b><br>The affliction mentioned here can be understood as a series of calamities and hardships that befell Israel due to their unfaithfulness. This includes military defeats, economic hardships, and social turmoil. Theologically, affliction is often used as a tool for correction and repentance, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's obedience or disobedience.<p><b>and delivered them into the hands of plunderers,</b><br>This phrase describes the military invasions and subsequent oppression by foreign powers, primarily the Assyrians. The Assyrians were known for their brutal tactics and deportation policies, which were part of God's judgment. This aligns with the covenant curses in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where God warns of foreign domination as a consequence of disobedience. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over nations and His use of them to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>until He had banished them from His presence.</b><br>The banishment from God's presence signifies the exile of the Northern Kingdom. In biblical terms, being in God's presence is associated with blessing and protection, as seen in the temple in Jerusalem. The exile represents a loss of identity and divine favor, paralleling the expulsion from Eden (Genesis 3). This phrase also foreshadows the eventual exile of Judah and serves as a warning to remain faithful to God. Theologically, it points to the need for a new covenant, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who restores the broken relationship between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is just and righteous in His dealings with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/descendants_of_israel.htm">Descendants of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the Northern Kingdom of Israel, consisting of the ten tribes that separated from Judah after Solomon's reign.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/plunderers.htm">Plunderers</a></b><br>Invading forces, particularly the Assyrians, who were used by God as instruments of judgment against Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/banished_from_his_presence.htm">Banished from His Presence</a></b><br>The exile of the Northern Kingdom, a significant event where the Israelites were removed from the Promised Land due to their persistent idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrian_exile.htm">Assyrian Exile</a></b><br>The historical event in 722 BC when the Assyrians conquered the Northern Kingdom and deported many Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_idolatry.htm">The Seriousness of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is a grave sin that leads to separation from God.
