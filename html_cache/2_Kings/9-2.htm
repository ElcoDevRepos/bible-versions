The context is a directive given by the prophet Elisha to one of the sons of the prophets. The arrival signifies the fulfillment of God's timing in executing judgment on the house of Ahab, as previously prophesied by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>).<p><b>look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi</b><br>Jehu is identified with precision, emphasizing his lineage. Jehu, a commander in the Israelite army, is chosen by God to be an instrument of judgment. His father, Jehoshaphat, and grandfather, Nimshi, are mentioned to distinguish him from others with similar names. This lineage is significant as it connects Jehu to the broader narrative of Israel's kingship and God's sovereign choice. Jehu's role fulfills the prophecy against the house of Ahab, aligning with God's justice and sovereignty (<a href="/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6-10</a>).<p><b>Go in, get him away from his companions</b><br>This instruction highlights the need for privacy and discretion. Jehu was among his fellow officers, and the prophet's task required a private setting to deliver God's message. This separation underscores the seriousness and divine nature of the mission. It reflects the biblical theme of God calling individuals out from among others for a specific purpose, similar to how God called Moses (<a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3:1-10</a>).<p><b>and take him to an inner room</b><br>The inner room signifies a place of confidentiality and importance. In ancient Near Eastern culture, inner rooms were often used for private and significant discussions. This setting ensures that the anointing of Jehu as king is conducted without interference, reflecting the solemnity of the occasion. The inner room can also symbolize the inner sanctum of God's will, where divine plans are revealed and initiated. This private anointing parallels the anointing of David by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>), where God's choice is made known in a secluded setting.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jehu is the son of Jehoshaphat and grandson of Nimshi.

No delays, no excuses&#8212;just obedience, much like Abraham setting out &#8220;early the next morning&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows God frequently ties His plans to specific places and moments (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/acts/9-11.htm">Acts 9:11</a>). The verse reminds us that divine appointments happen in real time and space, underscoring the historical reliability of the narrative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8230;look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi.&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/9-2.htm">2 Kings 9:2</a>b)<p>&#8226; A precise name, a precise lineage. God&#8217;s plans are never vague. Long before this scene, Elijah had been told, &#8220;You shall anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king over Israel&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>). Now that word is being fulfilled.<p>&#8226; The detail echoes other specific callings&#8212;Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>), Cyrus (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a> &#8211; 45:1), and even Paul (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>). Each shows God&#8217;s sovereignty over leadership.<p>&#8226; The double reference to Jehu&#8217;s family line reinforces legitimacy. Just as &#8220;David son of Jesse&#8221; became a recognized title (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>), Jehu is publicly identified so there can be no mistake about whom God is elevating.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go in, get him away from his companions</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;Go in, get him away from his companions&#8230;&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/9-2.htm">2 Kings 9:2</a>c)<p>&#8226; A private moment precedes a public mission. Gideon was first addressed at night in secret (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11&#8211;14</a>). David was anointed in the presence of selected witnesses before facing Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Separation underscores seriousness. Jehu will soon confront King Joram and Jezebel; before that storm, God draws him aside for clarity&#8212;much like Jesus taking Peter, James, and John apart on the mountain (<a href="/mark/9-2.htm">Mark 9:2</a>).<p>&#8226; It also protects the messenger. Delivering a politically charged prophecy in a military camp could invite instant backlash (<a href="/1_kings/18-17.htm">1 Kings 18:17</a>). Privacy guards the young prophet and ensures the message reaches the right ears first.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and take him to an inner room</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8230;and take him to an inner room.&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/9-2.htm">2 Kings 9:2</a>d)<p>&#8226; Inner rooms signify confidentiality and covenant moments: the Passover meal (<a href="/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22</a>), Elisha raising the Shunammite&#8217;s son (<a href="/2_kings/4-33.htm">2 Kings 4:33</a>), Jesus&#8217;s instructions in the upper room (<a href="/luke/22-12.htm">Luke 22:12&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; An inner room also limits outside influence. Jehu must hear God&#8217;s agenda, not the chatter of comrades. Similarly, Paul &#8220;did not consult with flesh and blood&#8221; immediately after his call (<a href="/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The setting underlines holiness. With no audience but God, Jehu&#8217;s anointing emphasizes that authority flows from heaven first, then is displayed before men (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/9-2.htm">2 Kings 9:2</a> shows God orchestrating a precise, private, and purposeful commissioning of Jehu. Every phrase&#8212;arrival, identification, separation, and secrecy&#8212;reveals the Lord&#8217;s intentional hand: He acts at the right time, selects the right person, removes distractions, and consecrates the moment away from public noise. The verse assures us that when God raises up leaders, He does so with clarity, sovereignty, and intimate care, grounding His plan firmly in real history and inviting His people into faithful obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And when thou comest thither.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And enter into it--i.e.</span>, into the town of Ramoth. This makes it clear that the Israelites had retaken Ramoth from the Syrians (comp. also the mention of "chambers" and "the door" in <a href="/2_kings/9-3.htm" title="Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus said the LORD, I have anointed you king over Israel.

Nothing is known of Jehu's origin. He is twice mentioned by Shalmaneser II., king of Assyria, as one of his tributaries. In a fragment of his Annals relating to the campaign against Hazael, undertaken in his eighteenth year (see Note on <a href="/2_kings/8-15.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.">2Kings 8:15</a>), the Assyrian monarch states that, after besieging Damascus, and ravaging the Hauran, he marched to the mountains of Baal-<span class= "ital">rosh</span>, the foreland of the sea (Carmel?), and set up his royal image thereon. "In that day the tribute of the land of the Tyrians (and) Sidonians, (and) of Ya'ua (Jehu), son of Omri, I received." On the Black Obelisk there is a representation of Jehu's tribute-bearers, and, perhaps, of Jehu himself, kneeling before Shalmaneser. The superscription is: "Tribute of Ya'ua, son of Humri (Omri)--(ingots of) silver and gold, a bowl of gold, ewers of gold, goblets of gold, buckets of gold, (ingots of) lead, a rod of the hand of the king, spears--I received it."<p><span class= "bld">Go in.</span>--Into Jehu's house. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when thou comest thither, look out Share Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi.</span> Jehu had been in a high position under Ahab (ver. 25), and had been pointed out to Elijah, by Divine revelation, as the future King of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>). Elijah had been bidden to anoint him king, but apparently had neglected to do so, or rather had devolved the task upon his successor. Meantime Jehu served as a soldier under Ahaziah and Jehoram, Ahab's sons, and attained such distinction that he became one of the captains of the host (<span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 5), according to Josephus (<span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.) the chief captain. Jehu was commonly known as "the son of Nimshi" (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-20.htm">2 Kings 9:20</a>), either because, his father having died young, he was brought up by his grandfather, or perhaps simply "because Nimshi was a person of more importance than Jehoshaphat." <span class="cmt_word">And go in</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, seek his presence, go into his quarters, wherever they may be, have direct speech with him - <span class="cmt_word">and make him arise up from among his brethren</span> (comp. vers. 5 and 6). Jehu's "brethren" are his <span class="accented">brother-officers</span>, among whom Elisha knows that he will be found sitting. <span class="cmt_word">And carry him to an inner chamber.</span> Persuade him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to quit the place where thou wilt find him sitting with the other generals, and to go with thee into a private apartment for secret conference. Secrecy was of extreme importance, lest Joram should get knowledge of what was happening, and prepare himself for resistance. Had he not been taken by surprise, the result might have been a long and bloody civil war. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/9-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When you arrive,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;&#1514;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
