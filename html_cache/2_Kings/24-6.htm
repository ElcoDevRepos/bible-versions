The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting burial in the family tomb. Jehoiakim's reign was marked by idolatry and rebellion against God, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36-24</a>:5. His death fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>), which foretold that he would not be mourned properly and would have a dishonorable burial. Historically, Jehoiakim was a vassal to Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and his reign was characterized by political instability and subjugation to foreign powers.<p><b>and his son Jehoiachin reigned in his place</b><br>Jehoiachin, also known as Jeconiah or Coniah, succeeded his father Jehoiakim as king. His reign was brief, lasting only three months, as noted in <a href="/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>. During this time, the Babylonian threat loomed large, and Jehoiachin eventually surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar, leading to his exile along with many of Judah's elite (<a href="/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12-16</a>). This transition of power highlights the fulfillment of God's judgment on Judah for their persistent disobedience, as prophesied by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24-30</a>). Jehoiachin's captivity in Babylon is significant in biblical history, as it marks the beginning of the Babylonian Exile, a pivotal event in the narrative of Israel. Despite his initial downfall, Jehoiachin's later release from prison (<a href="/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27-30</a>) foreshadows the eventual restoration of the Davidic line, which is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the eternal King from David's lineage (<a href="/matthew/1-11.htm">Matthew 1:11-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned from 609 to 598 BC.

Scripture records the death of this king as fact, continuing the faithful chronology that runs from Genesis through Revelation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-6.htm">2 Chronicles 36:6-7</a> confirms that Jehoiakim had already been subdued by Nebuchadnezzar, hinting that his death occurs under foreign domination.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a> had prophesied that Jehoiakim would not be mourned with honor. His &#8220;rest&#8221; therefore carries an implicit note of divine judgment rather than peaceful closure.<p>&#8226; The phrase also reminds us that in God&#8217;s sovereign timeline, earthly rulers rise and fall exactly when He decrees (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With his fathers</b><p>&#8226; This customary formula indicates burial among ancestral tombs, emphasizing continuity of Israel&#8217;s royal line even amid national turmoil (<a href="/1_kings/2-10.htm">1 Kings 2:10</a>; 14:31).<p>&#8226; Yet Jeremiah&#8217;s words about a &#8220;donkey&#8217;s burial&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>) suggest Jehoiakim may not have received full royal honors. The biblical record allows both statements to stand: the king died as foretold, and God&#8217;s verdict overshadowed any human ceremony.<p>&#8226; The history of Judah shows a pattern&#8212;obedient kings receive honor in death, disobedient kings do not (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-19.htm">2 Chronicles 21:19-20</a>). Jehoiakim&#8217;s burial phrase highlights that contrast.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his son Jehoiachin</b><p>&#8226; God preserves David&#8217;s line even through sinful heirs. Jehoiachin (also called Jeconiah or Coniah) legitimately succeeds his father (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-8.htm">2 Chronicles 36:8-9</a>), underscoring the unbroken covenant promise (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; At only eighteen (<a href="/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>), Jehoiachin inherits a kingdom already weakened by Babylon. The verse signals a fragile succession in the face of God&#8217;s impending judgment.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24-30</a> marks Jehoiachin with a curse&#8212;yet later grace appears when he is released in Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27-30</a>). Even dark chapters carry threads of future hope.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Reigned in his place</b><p>&#8226; The throne transfer is immediate; political power seldom sits vacant in Scripture (<a href="/1_kings/1-30.htm">1 Kings 1:30</a>). Judah&#8217;s monarchy continues yet moves inexorably toward exile.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10-12</a> records that within three months Nebuchadnezzar deposes Jehoiachin. The swift reign shows how sin&#8217;s consequences accelerate national decline (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36-37</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, God&#8217;s redemptive agenda advances. Jehoiachin&#8217;s captivity preserves the royal seed in Babylon, setting the stage for genealogical fulfillment in <a href="/matthew/1-11.htm">Matthew 1:11-12</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/24-6.htm">2 Kings 24:6</a> succinctly reports Jehoiakim&#8217;s death and Jehoiachin&#8217;s accession. Each phrase affirms God&#8217;s precise control over history: a rebellious king dies under judgment, a covenant line continues through his son, and the stage is set for exile and eventual restoration. The verse is a sober reminder that the Lord governs life, death, and leadership, faithfully accomplishing His purposes through every generation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers.</span>--The usual notice of the king's burial is omitted, and the omission is significant, considered in the light of Jeremiah's prophecy: "Thus saith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; they shall not lament for him . . . He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem"(<a href="/context/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>; comp. <a href="/jeremiah/36-30.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit on the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.">Jeremiah 36:30</a>). Jehoiakim appears to have been slain in an encounter with the bauds of freebooters mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm" title="And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servants the prophets.">2Kings 24:2</a>, so that his body was left to decay where it fell, all his followers having perished with him. Ewald supposes that he was lured out of Jerusalem to a pretended conference with the Chaldeans, and then treacherously seized, and, as he proved a refractory prisoner, slain, and his body denied the last honours, his family craving its restoration in vain. (The words of the text do not necessarily imply <span class= "ital">a natural and peaceful</span> death, as Thenius alleges, but simply <span class= "ital">death</span> without further qualification.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers.</span> It is not certain that the writer means anything more by this than that "Jehoiakim died." His body may, however, possibly have been found by the Jews after the Babylonians had withdrawn from before Jerusalem, and have been entombed with those of Manasseh, Amen, and Josiah. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead, Josephus says</span> (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) that Nebuchadnezzar placed him upon the throne, which is likely enough, since he would certainly not have quitted Jerusalem without setting up some king or other. Jehoiachin has in Scripture the two other names of Jeconiah (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16, 17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/27-20.htm">Jeremiah 27:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/28-4.htm">Jeremiah 28:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>) and Coniah (<a href="/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24, 28</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>). Jehoiachin and Jeconiah differ only, as Jehoahaz and Ahaziah, by a reversal of the order of the two elements. Both mean "Jehovah will establish (him)." "Conlah" cuts off from "Jeconiah" the sign of futurity, and means "Jehovah establishes." It is used only by Jeremiah, and seems used by him to signify that though "Jehovah establishes," Jeconiah he would <span class="accented">not</span> establish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/24-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Jehoiakim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3079.htm">Strong's 3079: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehoiakim -- 'the LORD raises up', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rested</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;ka&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
