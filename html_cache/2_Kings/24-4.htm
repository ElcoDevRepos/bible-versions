The shedding of innocent blood is a grave sin in the biblical context, as it violates the sanctity of life, which is a gift from God. This act is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, where God establishes the principle of justice for murder. The innocent blood here symbolizes the extreme moral corruption and apostasy of Judah under Manasseh's reign, which ultimately led to divine judgment.<p><b>For he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood,</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the extent of the violence and injustice that permeated Jerusalem. The city, meant to be a holy place where God's presence dwelt in the temple, had become a place of rampant sin and bloodshed. This filling of Jerusalem with innocent blood signifies a complete moral decay and a society that has turned away from God's commandments. The historical context shows that such actions were not isolated incidents but part of a broader pattern of rebellion against God. This mirrors the warnings given by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, who called out the leaders and people of Judah for their sins and warned of impending judgment.<p><b>and the LORD was unwilling to forgive.</b><br>This phrase highlights the severity of Judah's sin and the point at which God's patience had been exhausted. Theologically, it underscores the concept of divine justice and the limits of God's forbearance. While God is merciful and forgiving, persistent and unrepentant sin can lead to a point where judgment becomes inevitable. This is consistent with the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's obedience or disobedience. The unwillingness to forgive here is not due to a lack of mercy on God's part but rather the people's refusal to repent and turn back to Him. This serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin and the importance of repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this period, known for his evil practices and disobedience to God, which included shedding innocent blood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, which became filled with innocent blood due to the actions of its leaders and people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is depicted as just and unwilling to forgive the shedding of innocent blood without repentance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/innocent_blood.htm">Innocent Blood</a></b><br>Refers to the unjust killing of those who were not guilty of any crime, a grave sin in the eyes of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_invasion.htm">Babylonian Invasion</a></b><br>The context of this verse is the impending judgment and invasion by Babylon as a consequence of Judah's sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_life.htm">The Sanctity of Life</a></b><br>The shedding of innocent blood is a grave sin that God takes seriously.

Jeremiah, an eyewitness, echoed this: &#8220;On your skirts is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Widespread violence deforms an entire society. <a href="/psalms/11-5.htm">Psalm 11:5</a> reminds us, &#8220;The LORD hates the wicked and the one who loves violence.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The prophets repeatedly tied national collapse to the treatment of the helpless (<a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15-17</a>; <a href="/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>). When murder becomes commonplace, the moral fabric unravels, inviting judgment.<p>&#8226; By allowing&#8212;and even promoting&#8212;bloodshed, the king led the nation into collective guilt (<a href="/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the LORD was unwilling to forgive</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s default posture is mercy (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/86-5.htm">Psalm 86:5</a>), yet persistent, unrepentant sin can harden a people past the point of turning back (<a href="/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Manasseh himself later humbled himself and found personal pardon (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-12.htm">2 Chronicles 33:12-13</a>), but the public damage he caused outlived him. Choices have consequences that even sincere later repentance cannot always erase (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The LORD was unwilling to forgive&#8221; means the national sentence was now irrevocable. Babylon&#8217;s invasion (<a href="/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10-16</a>) became the instrument of divine justice, just as God forewarned through prophets like <a href="/isaiah/39-5.htm">Isaiah 39:5-7</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-11</a>.<p>&#8226; This sober line also warns every generation: rejecting God&#8217;s gracious calls eventually leaves only judgment (<a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a> teaches that God passionately defends innocent life. Manasseh&#8217;s reign drenched Jerusalem in blood, and the nation&#8217;s refusal to turn back pushed it beyond the limit of divine patience. While the Lord is overflowing in mercy, He is also perfectly just; habitual, hardened sin that despises human life will meet certain judgment. The passage urges us to honor life, practice justice, and respond quickly to God&#8217;s conviction, knowing He still offers forgiveness through the finished work of Christ to all who truly repent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">The innocent blood.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">blood of the innocent</span>; an expression like <span class= "ital">hand of the right, i.e.</span>, the right hand; or, <span class= "ital">day of the sixth, i.e.</span>, the sixth day. Thenius thinks the murder of some prominent personage, such as Isaiah, may be intended, and wishes to distinguish between the statement of the first clause of the verse and the second; but <a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm" title="Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.">2Kings 21:16</a>, where the two statements are connected more closely, does not favour this view.<p><span class= "bld">Which the Lord would not pardon.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and Jehovah willed not to pardon</span>. We must not soften the statement of <a href="/context/2_kings/24-3.htm" title="Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;">2Kings 24:3-4</a>, as Bahr does, by asserting the meaning to be that the nation was punished, not for the sins of Manasseh, but for its persistence in the same kind of sins. The sins of Manasseh are regarded as a climax in Judah's long course of provocation: the cup was full, and judgment ready to fall. It was only suspended for a time, not revoked, in the reign of the good king Josiah. In short, the idea of the writer is that the innocent blood shed by Manasseh cried to heaven for vengeance, and that the ruin of the kingdom was the answer of the All righteous Judge. It is no objection to say, that in that case children suffered for their fathers' misdeeds; that was precisely the Old Testament doctrine, until Ezekiel proclaimed another (<a href="/ezekiel/18-19.htm" title="Yet say you, Why? does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.">Ezekiel 18:19</a>; comp. <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-9.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,">Deuteronomy 5:9</a>). Looking at the catastrophe from a different standpoint, <span class= "ital">we</span> may remember that national iniquities must be chastised in the present life, if at all; and that the sufferings of the exile were necessary for the purification of Israel from its inveterate tendency to apostatise from Jehovah. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And also for the innocent blood that he shed</span> (comp. <a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.).
