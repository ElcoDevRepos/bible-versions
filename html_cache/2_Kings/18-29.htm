The Assyrian Empire was a dominant power during this period, known for its military prowess and conquests. The king's message is a direct challenge to the authority and faith of the people of Judah, as well as to their king, Hezekiah. This reflects the common practice of ancient Near Eastern kings to assert their dominance through proclamations and psychological warfare.<p><b>Do not let Hezekiah deceive you;</b><br>Hezekiah was the king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to reform the religious practices of his people by removing idolatry. The Assyrian king's statement is an attempt to undermine Hezekiah's leadership and the trust the people have in him. This tactic of sowing doubt is reminiscent of the serpent's words to Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, where deception is used to lead people away from trusting God's appointed leaders.<p><b>he cannot deliver you from my hand.</b><br>The Assyrian king boasts of his power and the futility of resistance against his forces. Historically, Assyria had a reputation for its brutal conquests and the subjugation of many nations, which would have made this threat seem credible. However, this statement sets the stage for a demonstration of God's power, as seen later in the narrative when God delivers Jerusalem from the Assyrian threat (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35-37</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance found in Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from the power of sin and death, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to reform the religious practices of his people by removing idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The King of Assyria, who invaded Judah and sent his officials to intimidate and demoralize the people of Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabshakeh.htm">Rabshakeh</a></b><br>The Assyrian official who delivered the message from Sennacherib to the people of Jerusalem, attempting to undermine their trust in Hezekiah and God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, under siege by the Assyrian army during this event.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrian_invasion.htm">Assyrian Invasion</a></b><br>A significant military campaign by Assyria against Judah, aiming to conquer Jerusalem and expand Assyrian control.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god_over_human_leaders.htm">Trust in God Over Human Leaders</a></b><br>Hezekiah's faithfulness contrasts with the Assyrian message of doubt.
