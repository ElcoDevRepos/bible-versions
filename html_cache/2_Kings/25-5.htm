Their pursuit of King Zedekiah represents the fulfillment of God's judgment against Judah for their persistent idolatry and disobedience, as prophesied by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>). The Chaldeans were known for their military prowess and strategic capabilities, which allowed them to effectively pursue and capture fleeing enemies.<p><b>and overtook him in the plains of Jericho</b><br>The plains of Jericho, located near the Jordan River, were a significant geographical area in biblical history. Jericho was one of the first cities conquered by the Israelites under Joshua (Joshua 6). The capture of Zedekiah in this location symbolizes the reversal of Israel's fortunes due to their unfaithfulness. The plains provided little cover for escape, making it an ideal location for the Chaldeans to overtake the fleeing king.<p><b>and his whole army deserted him</b><br>The desertion of Zedekiah's army highlights the complete collapse of Judah's military and political structure. This abandonment fulfills the warnings given by the prophets, such as Jeremiah, who foretold the consequences of Judah's rebellion against God (<a href="/jeremiah/38-22.htm">Jeremiah 38:22</a>). The desertion also underscores the isolation and helplessness of Zedekiah, contrasting with the faithfulness of Jesus Christ, who, despite being abandoned by His disciples, remained steadfast in His mission (<a href="/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Refers to King Zedekiah of Judah, the last king before the Babylonian exile.
