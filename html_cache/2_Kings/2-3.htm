These groups were prevalent during the time of Elijah and Elisha, serving as centers for spiritual training and guidance. Bethel, meaning "House of God," was a significant religious site in Israel, though it had become a center for idolatrous worship after Jeroboam set up a golden calf there (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-29</a>). The presence of a prophetic community in Bethel indicates a remnant of true worshippers amidst widespread apostasy. Elisha, a prominent prophet, was recognized as Elijah's successor, and his presence among the prophets signifies his leadership and the continuation of Elijah's ministry.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Do you know that the LORD will take your master away from you today?&#8221;</b><br>The prophets at Bethel were aware of the impending departure of Elijah, indicating that God had revealed this event to them. This knowledge underscores the prophetic insight and communication with God that these communities possessed. Elijah's departure is a significant event, as he is one of the few individuals in the Bible who did not experience death but was taken up by God (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>). This event prefigures the ascension of Jesus Christ, who also was taken up into heaven (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>). The phrase "the LORD will take your master away" highlights the divine initiative in Elijah's departure, emphasizing God's sovereignty over the lives of His servants.<p><b>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; he replied.</b><br>Elisha's response indicates his awareness of the situation, showing his close relationship with God and his mentor, Elijah. This acknowledgment reflects Elisha's preparedness for the transition of leadership and his acceptance of the prophetic mantle. Elisha's knowledge of Elijah's departure also demonstrates the unity and shared revelation among the prophets, as God had communicated this event to multiple individuals. Elisha's calm acknowledgment contrasts with the anxiety or uncertainty that might be expected, illustrating his faith and trust in God's plan.<p><b>&#8220;Do not speak of it.&#8221;</b><br>Elisha's request to "not speak of it" suggests a desire to focus on the present moment and the tasks at hand rather than dwelling on the impending separation. This response may also reflect a sense of reverence and solemnity regarding the divine event about to occur. Elisha's instruction to remain silent can be seen as an expression of humility and submission to God's will, recognizing that some matters are beyond human discussion and should be approached with quiet faith. This attitude is reminiscent of Jesus' teachings on the importance of focusing on God's work and trusting in His timing (<a href="/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet and the successor of Elijah.

(See <a href="/1_kings/19-21.htm" title="And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.">1Kings 19:21</a>; <a href="/acts/22-3.htm" title="I am truly a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day.">Acts 22:3</a>.) Others again, but very improbably, take the words literally as a reference to Elijah's ascension, "away over thine head." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sons of the prophets that were at Bethel</span> (On the expression, "sons of the prophets," see the comment upon <a href="/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35</a>.) The institution of the "schools of the prophets," or theological colleges where young prophets were brought up, is usually assigned to Samuel, one of whose habitual residences for a part of the year was Bethel (<a href="/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>). Probably he had established a "school" there which continued to this time. <span class="cmt_word">Came forth to Elisha, and said unto him</span>. The students did not venture to address the master himself, who was a person of too much dignity to be intruded on; but sought out the servant, to give him a warning of what their prophetic instinct assured them was about to happen. <span class="cmt_word">Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> from his position as teacher and master) today? There was, perhaps, something a little officious and self-assertive in this question. They might have felt sure, if they had been properly modest, that Elisha would have at least as much prophetic instinct and foresight as themselves. Hence he answers them with something of rebuke: <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Yea, I know it</span> - literally, <span class="accented">I too know it</span> - <span class="cmt_word">hold ye your peace</span>; or, "Hush - do not chatter about what is so sacred; do not suppose that you are wiser than any one else; be a little modest and a little reticent." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/2-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the prophets</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
