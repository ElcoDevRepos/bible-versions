The priests mentioned here were likely those who served at the high places, which were unauthorized worship sites. By gathering them, Josiah aimed to centralize worship in Jerusalem, in accordance with <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>, which emphasizes a single place of worship.<p><b>and desecrated the high places, from Geba to Beersheba</b><br>The high places were local shrines often associated with idolatry.

Geba and Beersheba mark the northern and southern boundaries of Judah, indicating a comprehensive reform throughout the kingdom.<p><b>where the priests had burned incense</b><br>Burning incense was a common practice in both legitimate and illegitimate worship. In the context of high places, it was often associated with idolatry.

High places at the gates suggest that idolatrous practices had infiltrated public life. By tearing them down, Josiah was purging idolatry from both religious and civic spaces.<p><b>at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city</b><br>This specific location indicates that even prominent leaders were involved in or tolerated idolatrous practices. Joshua the governor may have been a significant figure, and the mention of his gate highlights the extent of the reform needed to cleanse the city from idolatry.<p><b>which was to the left of the city gate</b><br>The detail of the location underscores the thoroughness of Josiah's reform.

The Levitical priests, who in various cities of Judah had conducted the worship at the high places, were summoned to Jerusalem by Josiah, and forced to remain there, that the unauthorized worship which they had conducted might be brought to an end. <span class="cmt_word">And defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense.</span> Hezekiah had "removed the high places, and broken the images, and cut down the groves" throughout his dominions (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>), but he had not in any way "defiled the high places;" and therefore no sooner did a king take a different view of his duties than the worship was at once restored (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>), and flourished as before. Josiah conceived the idea that, if the high places were "defiled," it would be impossible to renew the worship at them. <span class="cmt_word">From Geba to Beersheba.</span> Geba takes here the place of Bethel as the northern limit of Judah. It was situated at a very short distance from Bethel, and was made to supersede it on account of the idolatries by which Bethel had been disgraced. The exact site is probably the modern <span class="accented">Jeba</span>, on the southern edge of the Wady Suweinit. <span class="cmt_word">And brake down the high places of the gates.</span> The high-place worship had, it would seem, invaded Jerusalem itself. In some of the gates of the city, which were "large open buildings for public meetings and intercourse" (Bahr), altars, or more elaborate places of worship, had been established, and an unauthorized ritual of the high-place type had been set up. That were - rather, <span class="accented">that which was - <span class="cmt_word"></span>in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city.</span> This and the succeeding clauses are limitations of the general statement concerning the "high places of the gates," and indicate that two gates only had been polluted by high-place worship, viz. "the gate of Joshua," and the gale known <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> as "the city gate."
