The covenant refers to the agreements made at Mount Sinai, where God gave the Law to Moses (Exodus 19-24). This covenant was central to Israel's identity as God's chosen people and included promises of blessing for obedience and consequences for disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). The call to remember is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-23.htm">Deuteronomy 4:23</a> and <a href="/joshua/23-11.htm">Joshua 23:11-16</a>, where the Israelites are reminded of their obligations to God. Forgetting the covenant often led to idolatry and apostasy, as seen in the history of Israel and Judah, culminating in the exile. This phrase also foreshadows the New Covenant prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who established a new relationship between God and humanity through His death and resurrection.<p><b>Do not worship other gods,</b><br>This command underscores the monotheistic foundation of Israel's faith, as articulated in the Shema: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one" (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). Worshiping other gods was a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>) and was a persistent issue throughout Israel's history. The allure of surrounding pagan cultures and their deities often led Israel astray, as seen in the worship of Baal and Asherah (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>, <a href="/1_kings/18-18.htm">1 Kings 18:18-21</a>). This command is a call to exclusive loyalty to Yahweh, who alone is worthy of worship. The prohibition against idolatry is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are warned against the worship of anything other than God (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14, 1</a> <a href="/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a>). This phrase also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is the true image of the invisible God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>) and the one through whom believers have access to the Father (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom of Israel, which was experiencing spiritual decline and idolatry, leading to its eventual exile by the Assyrians.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who had established a relationship with Israel, emphasizing exclusive worship and obedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrian_exile.htm">Assyrian Exile</a></b><br>The event where the Northern Kingdom was conquered and its people were taken into exile due to their persistent idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Messengers sent by God to warn Israel of the consequences of their idolatry and to call them back to covenant faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The solemn agreement between God and Israel, which included blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_faithfulness.htm">Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>God calls His people to remember and uphold the covenant.

Jesus declared, &#8220;This cup is the new covenant in My blood&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>). Forgetting that covenant drains our worship of power and our witness of credibility (<a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not worship other gods</b><p>&#8226; Idolatry was the inevitable outcome of covenant amnesia. &#8220;Do not worship other gods&#8221; reiterates the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>) and the Shema&#8217;s call to exclusive love (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-14.htm">Deuteronomy 6:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29-33</a> the people blended pagan rituals with nominal allegiance to the LORD&#8212;a syncretism God never tolerates (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Idolatry today may appear in subtler forms&#8212;money, status, pleasure&#8212;but the heart-issue is unchanged: anything that competes with the Lord&#8217;s rightful supremacy is a rival god (<a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical safeguards:<p>&#8211; Examine affections in light of <a href="/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>, &#8220;where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Expose counterfeit gods with the truth of <a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10-11</a>, which contrasts the living God with lifeless idols.<p>&#8211; Engage in wholehearted worship, as modeled in <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1-2</a>, offering our bodies &#8220;as a living sacrifice.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The command carries both warning and promise: turning from idols invites the discipline seen in Israel&#8217;s exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>), but wholehearted devotion ushers in covenant blessing (<a href="/psalms/16-4.htm">Psalm 16:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/17-38.htm">2 Kings 17:38</a> is a twin command: keep God&#8217;s covenant and refuse every rival.

He expects his words to reach the ears of the mixed race inhabiting Samaria in his day, and would fain warn them against their idolatrous practices, and point them to the pure worship of Jehovah. It is pleasing to remember that ultimately the mixed race was won to the true faith, and that the Samaritans of our Lord's time were as true worshippers of Jehovah, and as zealous followers of the Law, as the Jews themselves. The interesting community at Nablous still maintains Samaritan forms, and reads the Samaritan Pentateuch. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/17-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">forget</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;i&#353;&#183;k&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7911.htm">Strong's 7911: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mislay, to be oblivious of, from want of memory, attention</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the covenant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hab&#183;b&#601;&#183;r&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
