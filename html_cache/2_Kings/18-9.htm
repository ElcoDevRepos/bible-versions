His reign is often contrasted with that of the kings of Israel, who were generally more idolatrous. The fourth year of his reign would place this event around 725 BC. Hezekiah's reign is significant for its religious reforms and his trust in God during times of crisis, such as the Assyrian threat.<p><b>which was the seventh year of the reign of Hoshea son of Elah over Israel</b><br>Hoshea was the last king of the northern kingdom of Israel. His reign was marked by political instability and idolatry, which ultimately led to the downfall of Israel. The seventh year of Hoshea's reign would be around 725 BC, aligning with the timeline of Assyrian aggression. Hoshea's reign ended with the fall of Samaria, fulfilling the warnings given by prophets like Hosea and Amos about the consequences of Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>Shalmaneser king of Assyria</b><br>Shalmaneser V was the Assyrian king who reigned from 727 to 722 BC. The Assyrian Empire was a dominant power in the ancient Near East, known for its military prowess and harsh treatment of conquered peoples. Shalmaneser's campaigns against Israel were part of Assyria's broader strategy to expand its influence and control over the region. The Assyrian kings are often depicted in the Bible as instruments of God's judgment against Israel and Judah for their sins.<p><b>marched against Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel. It was strategically located and well-fortified, making it a significant target for Assyrian expansion. The march against Samaria was a decisive move by Shalmaneser to subdue Israel and bring it under Assyrian control. This event is a pivotal moment in biblical history, marking the end of the northern kingdom and the beginning of the Assyrian exile.<p><b>and besieged it</b><br>The siege of Samaria lasted for about three years, from 725 to 722 BC. This prolonged siege reflects the strength of Samaria's defenses and the determination of the Assyrians to capture the city. The fall of Samaria was a fulfillment of prophetic warnings and a demonstration of God's judgment on Israel for its persistent idolatry and disobedience. The siege and subsequent exile of the Israelites are significant in biblical history, as they led to the dispersion of the ten tribes and the loss of their distinct identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah known for his faithfulness to God and reforms to restore proper worship in Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hoshea_son_of_elah.htm">Hoshea son of Elah</a></b><br>The last king of Israel, reigning during the time of the Assyrian conquest of Samaria.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shalmaneser.htm">Shalmaneser</a></b><br>The king of Assyria who initiated the siege against Samaria, leading to the fall of the Northern Kingdom of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which fell to the Assyrians during this period.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A dominant empire during this time, known for its military conquests and expansion, including the conquest of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_vs._unfaithfulness.htm">Faithfulness vs. Unfaithfulness</a></b><br>Hezekiah's reign is marked by faithfulness to God, contrasting with the unfaithfulness of Israel under Hoshea.

While Hezekiah&#8217;s fourth year marked the rise of reform in Judah, Hoshea&#8217;s seventh year marked the final countdown for Israel. Assyria&#8217;s siege of Samaria fulfilled long-standing prophetic warnings, proving that every promise of Scripture stands firm&#8212;encouraging God&#8217;s people today to walk in wholehearted obedience and confident trust.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9-12) The account of the captivity of northern Israel is repeated here, because the editor faithfully reproduces what he found in the abstract of the <span class= "ital">Jud?an</span> history of the kings.

According to all probable human calculation, the fall of Samaria should have been followed <span class="accented">at once</span> by an attack on Judaea; and but for the change of dynasty, and troubles on all sides which ensued thereupon, this would naturally have taken place. As it was, Judaea was allowed a Breathing-space, during which she strengthened her power in Philistia (see the comment on the preceding verse), and otherwise prepared herself to resist attack (see <a href="/2_chronicles/33-3.htm">2 Chronicles 33:3-6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8-11</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah King of Israel.</span> Hezekiah Began to reign before Hoshea had completed his third year (ver. 1).
