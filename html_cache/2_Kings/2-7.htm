These groups were common in Israel during the time of the prophets, serving as centers for training and spiritual instruction. The number fifty may symbolize completeness or a significant group, indicating a substantial gathering of witnesses to the events about to unfold.<p><b>went and stood at a distance</b><br>Standing at a distance suggests reverence and respect for the prophetic office and the significant event they anticipated. It also indicates their awareness of the sacred nature of what was about to occur. This distance allowed them to observe without interfering, highlighting the separation between the prophetic leaders and their followers.<p><b>facing Elijah and Elisha</b><br>Elijah and Elisha were central figures in the prophetic tradition of Israel. Elijah, known for his powerful miracles and confrontation with idolatry, was nearing the end of his earthly ministry. Elisha, his chosen successor, was about to receive the mantle of leadership. The sons of the prophets facing them signifies their recognition of the authority and transition of prophetic leadership.<p><b>as the two of them stood by the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River holds significant biblical symbolism, often representing transition and transformation. It was the site of Israel's crossing into the Promised Land under Joshua, symbolizing new beginnings. Here, it marks the transition of prophetic authority from Elijah to Elisha. The Jordan also prefigures the baptism of Jesus, where He began His public ministry, drawing a typological connection between Elijah's ascension and Christ's later work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A major prophet in Israel, known for his powerful miracles and his role in turning the hearts of the people back to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>The successor of Elijah, chosen by God to continue the prophetic ministry in Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_the_prophets.htm">Sons of the Prophets</a></b><br>A group or school of prophets who were disciples or followers of the prophetic tradition, often associated with Elijah and Elisha.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jordan_river.htm">Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant geographical and spiritual landmark in Israel, often associated with miraculous events and transitions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/company_of_fifty_men.htm">Company of Fifty Men</a></b><br>A specific group from the sons of the prophets who witnessed the events from a distance, symbolizing the broader community of believers observing God's work.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/witnessing_god's_work.htm">Witnessing God's Work</a></b><br>The sons of the prophets stood at a distance, observing the work of God through Elijah and Elisha.

For the sons of the prophets to have approached nearer, and hung on the skirts of Elijah, would have been an impertinence, Elisha's persistence is only justified by his strong affection, and the special office which he held, of attendant minister. The fifty students showed a courteous sense of what was due to the prophet's desire of seclusion by not pressing on his footsteps, and at the same time a real interest in him, and a reasonable curiosity, by quitting their college and "standing to view" on some eminence which commanded a prospect of the lower Jordan valley. There were many such eminences within a short distance of Jericho. <span class="cmt_word">And they two stood by Jordan.</span> At length all other human companionship was shaken off - "<span class="accented">they two"</span> stood, side by side, on the banks of the sacred stream, which had played so important a part, and was still to play so far more important a part, in the theocratic history. All the world, except their two selves, was remote - was beyond their ken; the master and the servant, the prophet of the past and the prophet of the coming generation, were together, with none to disturb them, or interfere between them, or separate them. Jordan rolled its waters before their eyes, a seeming barrier to further advance; and Elisha may naturally have looked to see the final scene transacted in that "plain below a plain," the Jordan bed, sunk beneath the general level of the Ghor, green with lush grass and aquatic plants, and with beds of reeds and osiers, but squalid with long stretches of mud and masses of decaying vegetation, brought down from the upper river, and with rotting trunks of trees torn from the banks higher up. But the end was not yet. Jordan was to be crossed, and the ascension to take place from the plain whence Moses, when about to quit earth, had made his ascent to Pisgah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then a company</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_582.htm">Strong's 582: </a> </span><span class="str2">Man, mankind</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of fifty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
