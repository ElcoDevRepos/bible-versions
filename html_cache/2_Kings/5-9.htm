His arrival with horses and chariots signifies his wealth, authority, and the seriousness of his condition, as he was seeking healing from leprosy. Horses and chariots were symbols of military might and prestige in ancient Near Eastern cultures, indicating Naaman's importance and the resources at his disposal. This scene contrasts with the humble means of the prophet Elisha, highlighting the difference between worldly power and spiritual authority.<p><b>and stood at the door of Elisha&#8217;s house</b><br>Elisha was a prophet in Israel, known for his miracles and as a successor to Elijah. Naaman's standing at the door signifies a moment of humility and expectation, as he seeks help from a foreign prophet despite his high status. This act of standing at the door can be seen as a metaphor for seeking divine intervention and guidance. The location, Elisha's house, suggests simplicity and a departure from the grandeur associated with Naaman's position. This setting emphasizes the theme of God's power working through humble means, a recurring motif in the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naaman.htm">Naaman</a></b><br>A commander of the army of the king of Aram, Naaman was a man of great importance and valor but suffered from leprosy.

In one representation of a fight between the Egyptians and a people invading Egypt from' Syria, the war-chariots of the latter are drawn by four oxen; but generally the horse was used on both sides. Syria imported her horses and chariots from Egypt (<a href="/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>), and, as appears from this passage, employed them for peaceful as well as for warlike purposes. There was a similar employment of them from a very early time in Egypt (see <a href="/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>; <a href="/genesis/50-9.htm">Genesis 50:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And stood at the door of the house of Elisha</span>.

His abode was probably a humble one; and when the great general, accompanied by his cavalcade of followers, drew up before it, he had, we may be sure, no intention of dismounting and entering. What he expected he tells us himself in ver. 11. The prophet regarded his pride and self-conceit as deserving of a rebuke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/5-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Naaman</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;m&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5283.htm">Strong's 5283: </a> </span><span class="str2">Naaman -- a descendant of Benjamin, also an Aramean (Syrian) general</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
