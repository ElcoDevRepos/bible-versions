His reign is noted for its significant departure from the religious reforms of his father, Hezekiah. Manasseh's acts included the reintroduction of idolatry and pagan practices, which had a profound impact on the spiritual state of Judah. His reign is often seen as a period of moral and spiritual decline, setting the stage for the eventual Babylonian exile.<p><b>along with all his accomplishments</b><br>Despite his negative spiritual influence, Manasseh's long reign suggests he was politically and administratively successful. He may have maintained stability and prosperity in Judah, which could explain his lengthy rule. However, his accomplishments are overshadowed by his religious failures, which are emphasized in the biblical narrative.<p><b>and the sin that he committed</b><br>Manasseh's sins were numerous and grave, including the worship of Baal, Asherah, and the host of heaven, as well as the practice of child sacrifice. These actions were in direct violation of the covenantal laws given to Israel. His sins are seen as a catalyst for divine judgment upon Judah, as they led the nation further away from God.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><br>This phrase indicates that the detailed account of Manasseh's reign, including his acts and sins, was recorded in an official historical document of the time. The "Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah" is a source frequently referenced in the biblical narrative, though it is not part of the canonical scriptures. It suggests that the biblical authors had access to historical records when compiling the accounts of the kings.

Kings hints at&#8212;while Chronicles details&#8212;his building projects and military defenses (2 Chron 33:14).<p>&#8226; He fortified Jerusalem&#8217;s walls, stationed commanders in every fortified city, and amassed wealth that kept the nation politically afloat.<p>&#8226; These &#8220;accomplishments,&#8221; however, could not cancel the moral weight of his earlier choices; earthly success never offsets spiritual rebellion (compare <a href="/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the sin that he committed</b><p>2 Kings has already summarized his transgressions (21:2-9):<p>&#8226; He did &#8220;evil in the sight of the LORD&#8221; like the nations God expelled (v.2).<p>&#8226; He rebuilt the high places Hezekiah had torn down, erected altars to Baal, made an Asherah, and worshiped &#8220;all the host of heaven.&#8221;<p>&#8226; He practiced sorcery, consulted mediums, and even sacrificed his own son in the fire (v.6).<p>&#8226; He placed pagan altars inside the very temple where God said, &#8220;In Jerusalem I will put My Name&#8221; (v.4; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>).<p>Sin&#8217;s record is kept just as carefully as any accomplishment, underscoring <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>&#8212;each of us will give an account.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are they not written</b><p>This question isn&#8217;t doubting but affirming.

From him we learn that, after prophetical warnings had been in vain addressed to him and to his people (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-10.htm">2 Chronicles 33:10</a>), he was visited with a Divine judgment, an Assyrian army under "captains" being sent against him, who took him prisoner, and carried him to Babylon - the city where Esarheddon, the successor of Sennacherib, and contemporary of Manasseh, ordinarily held his court. Here he remained for some considerable time "in affliction" (ver. 12), and, becoming convinced of sin and deeply penitent for his manifold transgressions, he turned to God in sincerity and truth, and being restored by the Assyrians to his kingdom, he put away the idolatrous practices and emblems which he had previously introduced, "repaired the altar of the Lord" which had gone to decay, and re-established, so far as he could, the worship of Jehovah (ver. 16). A special prophet, Hosai, seems to have chronicled his sins and his repentance in a work which survived the Captivity, and is twice quoted by the compiler of the Books of Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-18.htm">2 Chronicles 33:18, 19</a>). The submission of Manasseh to Esarhaddon is noted in the latter's annals, about the year <span class="date">B.C. 680</span> (see 'Eponym Canon,' p. 139, line 13). Other "acts" of Manasseh were the fortification of Jerusalem "on the west side of Gihon in the valley" the strengthening of the defenses of Ophel, and the occupation with strong garrisons of the various fortresses within his dominions. He thus played his part of tributary ally to Assyria With zeal, placing the south-eastern frontier in an excellent condition to resist the assaults of Egypt. Manasseh outlived Esarhaddon, and was for many years contemporary with Asshur-bani-pal, his son, whose inscriptions, however, contain no mention of him. Most likely his name occurred on Cylinder C, line 3, which is now illegible (see G. Smith's' History of Asshur-bani-pal,' p. 31,line c). <span class="cmt_word">And all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> The "sin which he sinned" is probably his persecution, which was viewed as his worst sin (see ver. 16;
