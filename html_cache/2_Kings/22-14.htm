Spiritual and civic leaders, led by Hilkiah, immediately seek prophetic confirmation of the discovered Law. Their visit to Huldah highlights (1) reverence for Scripture, (2) the duty of leadership to submit to God&#8217;s word, (3) God&#8217;s freedom to speak through whomever He chooses, and (4) the reliability of the historical account. The verse models how a nation&#8212;and every believer&#8212;should respond when confronted by the clear, authoritative voice of God: seek Him earnestly, listen humbly, and prepare to obey fully.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Went unto Huldah the prophetess.</span>--Why not to Jeremiah or Zephaniah?

It might have been expected that the matter would have been laid before one of these two persons. Possibly, however, neither of them was at Jerusalem.
