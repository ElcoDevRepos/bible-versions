After the death of Josiah, who was a reformer king, Judah was vulnerable to external powers. Neco's decision to appoint Eliakim as king demonstrates Egypt's control over Judah, a vassal state at this time. This act fulfilled the prophecy of Judah's subjugation to foreign powers due to their disobedience to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>).<p><b>and he changed Eliakim&#8217;s name to Jehoiakim</b><br>The changing of Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim by Pharaoh Neco is significant. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, renaming someone was a demonstration of authority and control. The name "Jehoiakim" means "Yahweh raises up," which is ironic given that it was Pharaoh, not God, who elevated him to the throne. This act symbolizes the loss of Judah's autonomy and foreshadows the spiritual decline under Jehoiakim's reign, contrasting with the godly leadership of his father, Josiah.<p><b>But Neco took Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt, where he died</b><br>Jehoahaz, also known as Shallum, was the younger brother of Eliakim and had been made king by the people of Judah after Josiah's death. His reign was short-lived, lasting only three months. Pharaoh Neco's decision to remove Jehoahaz and take him to Egypt, where he eventually died, underscores the political instability and the consequences of Judah's disobedience. This event is reminiscent of earlier prophecies about exile and death in foreign lands (<a href="/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10-12</a>).

It is against this that Shallum was not a Judean prince, but an obscure adventurer who usurped the throne of Samaria a hundred and fifty years previously, so that the allusion would not be very clear. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34-37.</span> - ACCESSION AND EARLY YEARS OF JEHOIAKIM. Pharaoh-Nechoh, when he deposed Jehoahaz, at once supplied his place by another king. He had no intention of altering the governmental system of Palestine, or of ruling his conquests in any other way than through dependent monarchs. His choice fell on Josiah's eldest surviving son (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>), Eliakim, who was the natural successor of his father. Eliakim, on ascending the throne, changed his name, as Jehoahaz appears to have done (see the comment on ver. 31), and reigned as Jehoiakim. For three years (B.C. 608-605) he continued a submissive vassal of the Egyptian monarch, and remitted him his tribute regularly (ver. 36). But his rule was in all respects an evil one. He "did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord" (ver. 37). He leant towards idolatry (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-8.htm">2 Chronicles 36:8</a>); he was oppressive and irreligious (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.' 10:5. &sect; 2); he "shed innocent blood" (<a href="/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>); he was luxurious (<a href="/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14, 15</a>), covetous (<a href="/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>), and tyrannical (<a href="/ezekiel/19-6.htm">Ezekiel 19:6</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh-Nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father.</span> (On the general inclination of Oriental monarchs to support the hereditary principle, and to establish sons in their fathers' governments, even when the father's had been rebels or enemies, see Herod., 3:15.) <span class="cmt_word">And turned his name to Jehoiakim.</span> We may understand that Nechoh required him to take a new name, as a mark of subjection (comp. <a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>; <a href="/ezra/5-14.htm">Ezra 5:14</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>; and also <a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>), but left the choice of the name to himself. He made the change as slight as possible, merely substituting "Jehovah" for "El" as the initial element. The sense of the name remained the same, "God will set up." The idea that Nechoh was pleased with the new name on account of its apparent connection with the Egyptian moon-god, Aah (Menzel), is very fanciful. <span class="cmt_word">And took Jehoahaz away</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> carried him captive to Egypt (see <a href="/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10, 11</a>;
