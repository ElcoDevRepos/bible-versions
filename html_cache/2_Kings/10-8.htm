The arrival of a messenger often signified important news. In this context, the messenger brings news to Jehu, who is in the midst of consolidating his power after being anointed king of Israel. This reflects the urgency and gravity of the situation as Jehu seeks to eliminate the house of Ahab.<p><b>he told Jehu, &#8220;They have brought the heads of the sons of the king.&#8221;</b><br>This gruesome act was part of Jehu's campaign to eradicate the lineage of Ahab, fulfilling the prophecy given by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-22</a>). The "sons of the king" refers to the seventy sons of Ahab, who were potential threats to Jehu's rule. The act of beheading and presenting the heads was a common practice in ancient warfare to demonstrate victory and instill fear. It also served as a public declaration of the end of Ahab's dynasty, aligning with God's judgment against Ahab's house.<p><b>And Jehu ordered, &#8220;Pile them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.&#8221;</b><br>The entrance of the gate was a significant location in ancient cities, often serving as a place for legal matters, public announcements, and gatherings. By ordering the heads to be piled at the gate, Jehu was making a public statement of his authority and the fulfillment of divine judgment. This act would have been a powerful visual reminder to the people of the consequences of idolatry and rebellion against God. It also served to legitimize Jehu's rule by showing that he was carrying out God's will, as prophesied by Elijah. The display until morning ensured that the message was seen by all, reinforcing Jehu's position as the new king and the end of Ahab's lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The newly anointed king of Israel, tasked with eradicating the house of Ahab as part of God's judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_messenger.htm">The Messenger</a></b><br>An unnamed individual who reports to Jehu about the execution of the king's sons.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king's_sons.htm">The King's Sons</a></b><br>The seventy sons of Ahab, whose execution was ordered by Jehu to fulfill God's judgment against Ahab's house.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gate.htm">The Gate</a></b><br>The entrance of the city, a significant place for public announcements and judgments in ancient Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, where these events take place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's justice, though sometimes delayed, is certain and thorough.
