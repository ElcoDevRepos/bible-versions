The events that befell Judah were not random but were orchestrated by God. This aligns with the biblical theme that God is in control of history (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>). The LORD's command reflects His authority and justice, as seen throughout the Old Testament, where God uses nations to execute His judgment (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>). The Babylonian exile was a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, who had long cautioned Judah about the consequences of their disobedience.<p><b>to remove them from His presence</b><br>The removal from God's presence signifies a severe judgment, as God's presence was central to Israel's identity and blessing (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14-16</a>). The temple in Jerusalem was the symbolic dwelling place of God among His people (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). Being removed from His presence meant losing the covenant blessings and protection. This exile is a reversal of the Exodus, where God brought His people into His presence. It also foreshadows the ultimate separation from God due to sin, which is addressed through Christ's redemptive work (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>).<p><b>because of the sins of Manasseh</b><br>Manasseh, one of Judah's most notorious kings, led the nation into idolatry and abominations (<a href="/2_kings/21-11.htm">2 Kings 21:11-16</a>). His reign is marked by the introduction of pagan worship, child sacrifice, and desecration of the temple. Despite his later repentance (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-12.htm">2 Chronicles 33:12-13</a>), the consequences of his actions had a lasting impact on Judah. This highlights the biblical principle that leaders bear significant responsibility for the spiritual direction of their people (<a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a>).<p><b>and all that he had done</b><br>This phrase encompasses the full extent of Manasseh's transgressions, which included leading Judah into sin and provoking God's anger (<a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>). The cumulative effect of his actions set a precedent for future generations, illustrating the concept of corporate responsibility and the long-term effects of sin (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>).
