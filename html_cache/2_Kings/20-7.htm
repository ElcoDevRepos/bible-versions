This instruction from Isaiah combines faith with action, showing that God can work through natural means to bring about His purposes.<p><b>So they brought it and applied it to the boil,</b><br>The boil, likely a severe infection or abscess, was a serious health issue. The application of the fig poultice represents obedience to the prophetic word, which is a recurring theme in Scripture.

It underscores the theme of divine healing and restoration found throughout the Bible.

"Many commentators suppose the figs to be mentioned as a remedy current at the time. But surely so simple and unscientific a medicine would have been thought of, without applying to the prophet by those about Hezekiah.
