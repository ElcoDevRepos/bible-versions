In the context of <a href="/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19</a>, this is part of a message from the Assyrian king, Sennacherib, to Hezekiah, king of Judah. The Assyrians were known for their military campaigns and conquests, which were widely recognized and feared throughout the ancient Near East. The phrase suggests that the reputation of Assyria's power and previous victories was well-known.<p><b>what the kings of Assyria have done</b><br>The Assyrian Empire was a dominant force in the ancient world, known for its military prowess and expansionist policies. The kings of Assyria, such as Tiglath-Pileser III, Shalmaneser V, and Sargon II, had successfully conquered many nations. This historical context underscores the threat posed by Sennacherib, who was continuing this legacy of conquest. The Assyrian kings were often seen as instruments of God's judgment in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>.<p><b>to all the other countries</b><br>This refers to the widespread conquests of the Assyrian Empire, which included regions such as Aram, Israel, and parts of Mesopotamia. The Assyrians were known for their brutal tactics, including deportation and destruction, which served to instill fear and ensure control over their territories. The mention of "all the other countries" emphasizes the comprehensive nature of Assyrian dominance.<p><b>devoting them to destruction</b><br>The phrase "devoting them to destruction" is reminiscent of the Hebrew concept of "herem," which involves the complete destruction of a city or people as an offering to God. In this context, it highlights the totality of the Assyrian conquests and their ruthless approach to warfare. This concept is also seen in the conquest narratives of the Israelites, such as in <a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>, where Jericho was devoted to destruction.<p><b>Will you then be spared?</b><br>This rhetorical question is intended to intimidate and demoralize Hezekiah and the people of Judah. It implies that, given the Assyrian track record, Judah's chances of survival are slim. However, this sets the stage for a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness, as Hezekiah's reliance on God leads to a miraculous deliverance. This theme of divine intervention is echoed in other biblical narratives, such as the deliverance of Israel from Egypt in Exodus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.
