The Assyrians had a policy of relocating conquered peoples to prevent rebellion, and they brought people from various regions to settle in the land of Israel. This relocation is documented in <a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>, where it mentions people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim. The settlers were unfamiliar with the land and its religious traditions, which sets the stage for the events that follow.<p><b>they did not worship the LORD</b><br>The settlers did not know or follow the worship practices of Yahweh, the God of Israel. This lack of worship is significant because it highlights the spiritual decline that had occurred in Israel, leading to its downfall. The Israelites had been warned repeatedly by prophets to turn from idolatry and return to the worship of the LORD (Yahweh), as seen in passages like <a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-15</a>. The settlers' ignorance of the LORD's worship underscores the loss of spiritual heritage and the consequences of Israel's disobedience.<p><b>so He sent lions among them</b><br>The sending of lions can be seen as a divine judgment or warning. In the ancient Near East, wild animals were often viewed as instruments of divine retribution. The presence of lions would have been a terrifying and unmistakable sign to the settlers that something was amiss. This act of sending lions is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God uses nature to communicate His displeasure or to bring about repentance, such as the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-11).<p><b>which killed some of them</b><br>The death of some settlers by lions served as a direct consequence of their failure to worship the LORD. This event would have been a powerful motivator for the settlers to seek understanding of the local deity and His requirements. It reflects the biblical principle that disobedience to God can lead to physical and spiritual consequences, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's obedience or disobedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The original inhabitants of the land who were exiled due to their disobedience to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_samaritans.htm">The Samaritans</a></b><br>A mixed population settled in the land of Israel by the Assyrian king after the Israelites were exiled.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is central to the account and whose fear and worship are required.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lions.htm">Lions</a></b><br>Sent by God as a form of judgment against the new inhabitants for not fearing Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrian_empire.htm">Assyrian Empire</a></b><br>The ruling power that conquered Israel and resettled the land with people from other nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_fearing_the_lord.htm">The Importance of Fearing the LORD</a></b><br>The fear of the LORD is foundational to a right relationship with Him.

Their ravages were understood by the colonists as a token of the wrath of the local deity on account of their neglect of his worship. The sacred writer endorses this interpretation of the incident, probably remembering <a href="/leviticus/26-22.htm" title="I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.">Leviticus 26:22</a>.

We may gather from what is said here that, though new settlers had been brought into the country by the Assyrians, yet still there had been a considerable decrease in the population, which had been favorable to the lions multiplying. The new settlers, it is to be noted, were placed in the towns (ver. 24); and it is probable that many of the country districts lay waste and desolate.
