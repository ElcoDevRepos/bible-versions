Her action of going up suggests that the prophet's room was on an upper level, a common architectural feature in ancient Israelite homes, where guest quarters were often located. This reflects her determination and urgency in addressing the crisis of her son's death.<p><b>and laid him on the bed of the man of God.</b><br>The bed of the man of God, Elisha, symbolizes a place of divine presence and power. By placing her deceased son on Elisha's bed, the Shunammite woman demonstrates her faith in the prophet's connection to God and her hope for a miracle. This act can be seen as an expression of her belief in the power of God working through His prophet, similar to how Elijah raised the widow's son in <a href="/1_kings/17-19.htm">1 Kings 17:19-23</a>.<p><b>Then she shut the door</b><br>Shutting the door indicates a private, sacred space, setting the stage for a divine encounter. It reflects a moment of faith and expectation, reminiscent of Jesus' instruction in <a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a> to pray in private. This action also prevents any interference or disturbance, allowing for a focused appeal to God through His prophet.<p><b>and went out.</b><br>Her departure signifies her next step of faith, seeking Elisha without delay. It underscores her proactive faith and determination to seek divine intervention. This mirrors the biblical theme of seeking God earnestly in times of need, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which emphasizes that God rewards those who earnestly seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shunammite_woman.htm">The Shunammite Woman</a></b><br>A notable woman from Shunem who showed great hospitality to Elisha, the prophet.

Elijah had placed on his own bed the child whom he restored to life (<a href="/1_kings/17-19.htm">1 Kings 17:19</a>); and the fact may have been known to the Shunammite.
