The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a peaceful passing and burial with ancestors. Jeroboam II's reign was marked by military success and territorial expansion, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23-28</a>. His rule brought a period of prosperity to Israel, though it was also a time of spiritual decline, as the people continued in the sins of Jeroboam I, who led Israel into idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). The mention of "the kings of Israel" places Jeroboam II within the northern kingdom's lineage, distinct from the southern kingdom of Judah. This distinction is crucial in understanding the divided monarchy period in Israel's history, which began after Solomon's reign.<p><b>And his son Zechariah reigned in his place.</b><br>Zechariah's ascension to the throne marks the continuation of the Jehu dynasty, fulfilling God's promise to Jehu that his descendants would sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>). Zechariah's reign, however, was short-lived, lasting only six months (<a href="/2_kings/15-8.htm">2 Kings 15:8</a>). His brief rule was characterized by the same idolatry and moral decline that plagued his predecessors, leading to his assassination by Shallum (<a href="/2_kings/15-10.htm">2 Kings 15:10</a>). This transition highlights the instability and frequent regime changes in the northern kingdom during this period. Theologically, Zechariah's reign and subsequent assassination underscore the consequences of Israel's persistent disobedience to God, as prophesied by the prophets Hosea and Amos, who ministered during this era.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam_ii.htm">Jeroboam II</a></b><br>He was the king of Israel who reigned for 41 years.

Yet, like the kings before him, he did not turn Israel from the sins of his namesake, Jeroboam I (<a href="/2_kings/14-24.htm">2 Kings 14:24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>).<p>&#8226; His death therefore closes a chapter of material blessing mixed with ongoing spiritual compromise&#8212;reminding us that no amount of success can offset disobedience to the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement also prepares readers for a rapid decline: when a leader who appears strong is removed, the true health of the nation is revealed (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his son Zechariah reigned in his place</b><p>&#8226; God had promised Jehu that four generations of his dynasty would sit on Israel&#8217;s throne (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>). Zechariah, Jeroboam II&#8217;s son, is the fourth and final link in that promise. His accession demonstrates the Lord&#8217;s absolute faithfulness to every word He speaks, even across decades (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>).<p>&#8226; Though the line continues, the text foreshadows instability. Within six months Zechariah will be assassinated (<a href="/2_kings/15-8.htm">2 Kings 15:8-10</a>). The northern kingdom is about to cycle through kings with alarming speed, fulfilling <a href="/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>: &#8220;They set up kings, but not by Me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Contrast this fleeting throne with the unbroken covenant God made with David for Judah&#8217;s line (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The brevity of Zechariah&#8217;s reign underscores the security found only in God&#8217;s chosen messianic line, ultimately fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; For today&#8217;s believer, the verse teaches that God&#8217;s promises are sure, but human leadership apart from wholehearted obedience quickly falters (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3-5</a>). Our confidence must rest in the eternal King, not in transient rulers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/14-29.htm">2 Kings 14:29</a> records a literal transition: King Jeroboam II dies, and his son Zechariah succeeds him.
