These priests were likely involved in syncretistic practices, blending the worship of Yahweh with pagan rituals. King Josiah's reforms aimed to centralize worship in Jerusalem, as prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>, to eliminate idolatry. The priests of the high places were not permitted to serve at the central altar in Jerusalem, signifying a separation from the true worship of Yahweh. This reflects the importance of purity in worship and the centralization of religious practices in the temple, which was the designated place for sacrifices and offerings.<p><b>they ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests</b><br>Unleavened bread is significant in Jewish tradition, particularly during Passover, symbolizing purity and the haste of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15-20</a>). Despite their exclusion from the altar service, these priests were still allowed to partake in certain communal religious activities, indicating a level of inclusion within the priestly community. This act of eating unleavened bread may symbolize a form of fellowship and shared identity among the priests, despite their different roles. It also underscores the theme of grace and restoration, as they were not completely cut off from the religious community. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers inclusion and redemption to those who turn back to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests_of_the_high_places.htm">Priests of the High Places</a></b><br>These were priests who served at local shrines or high places, which were often associated with idolatrous practices.
