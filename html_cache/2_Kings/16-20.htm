The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a joining with ancestors in the afterlife. Ahaz's reign was marked by idolatry and alliances with foreign powers, which were contrary to God's commands. His death signifies the end of a tumultuous period for Judah, characterized by spiritual decline and political instability.<p><b>and was buried with them in the City of David</b><br>The City of David refers to Jerusalem, specifically the area that was the original settlement of King David. Being buried in the City of David was an honor, indicating royal status and lineage. However, <a href="/2_chronicles/28-27.htm">2 Chronicles 28:27</a> notes that Ahaz was not buried in the tombs of the kings, suggesting a lack of honor due to his unfaithfulness to God. This burial location underscores the importance of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Judah.<p><b>and his son Hezekiah reigned in his place</b><br>Hezekiah's ascension to the throne marks a significant turning point for Judah. Unlike his father, Hezekiah is remembered as a righteous king who sought to restore the worship of Yahweh and purify the temple (<a href="/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18:1-6</a>). His reign is characterized by religious reforms and a return to covenant faithfulness. Hezekiah's leadership is often seen as a foreshadowing of Christ, as he acts as a savior figure for Judah, delivering them from Assyrian threats and leading a spiritual revival.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is known for his unfaithfulness to God, including idolatry and making alliances with foreign powers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The son of Ahaz, who succeeded him as king.

Even an unfaithful king could not nullify that promise (<a href="/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30-37</a>).<p>&#8211; The interment location also underscores that earthly honor can outlast personal righteousness&#8212;an implicit warning that God&#8217;s ultimate verdict matters more than human ceremony (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his son Hezekiah reigned in his place</b><p>&#8211; The throne passes smoothly to Hezekiah, illustrating God&#8217;s providence in preserving a Davidic successor (<a href="/2_kings/18-1.htm">2 Kings 18:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-1.htm">2 Chronicles 29:1</a>).<p>&#8211; A striking contrast unfolds: Ahaz led Judah into deeper idolatry, while Hezekiah &#8220;did what was right in the eyes of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3</a>).<p>&#8211; God often raises reformers after seasons of decline&#8212;renewing worship (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3-11</a>), cleansing the temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-15.htm">2 Chronicles 29:15-17</a>), and restoring covenant faithfulness (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4-6</a>).<p>&#8211; The seamless accession stresses divine sovereignty: human kings come and go, but the Lord&#8217;s redemptive plan moves forward (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/16-20.htm">2 Kings 16:20</a> closes the record of a troubled reign and opens the door to renewal. Ahaz dies and is buried in royal dignity, yet his life warns of the emptiness of compromise. The burial in the City of David reaffirms God&#8217;s unbroken covenant line. Hezekiah&#8217;s rise showcases the Lord&#8217;s ability to bring fresh obedience from the same lineage, proving that even after seasons of spiritual darkness, God&#8217;s faithfulness endures and His purposes prevail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David.</span> This must be taken in the same sense, and with the same limitations, as the same phrase in <a href="/2_kings/12-21.htm">2 Kings 12:21</a>.
