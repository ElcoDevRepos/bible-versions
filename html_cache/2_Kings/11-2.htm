Her father, King Joram (also known as Jehoram), was a king of Judah, and her brother Ahaziah was the king who had just been killed. This familial connection places her in a unique position of influence and risk. Her actions are significant in preserving the Davidic line, which is crucial for the fulfillment of the Messianic prophecy that the Messiah would come from the line of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>took Joash son of Ahaziah</b><br>Joash, also known as Jehoash, was the rightful heir to the throne of Judah. At this time, he was just an infant, making him vulnerable to the political upheaval and violence that followed his father's death. His survival was essential for the continuation of the Davidic dynasty, which had been promised an eternal throne (<a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3-4</a>).<p><b>and stole him away from among the sons of the king who were being murdered</b><br>Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah and grandmother of Joash, was executing a violent purge to secure her power by eliminating all potential claimants to the throne. This act of murder was not only a political move but also a spiritual attack against God's covenant with David. Jehosheba's intervention was a courageous act of defiance against Athaliah's tyranny and a preservation of God's promise.<p><b>She put him and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from Athaliah</b><br>The act of hiding Joash in a bedroom suggests a secretive and urgent effort to protect him. The presence of a nurse indicates the child's young age and need for care. This hiding place was likely within the temple precincts, as Jehosheba was married to Jehoiada, the high priest, providing a secure and sacred refuge. This setting underscores the theme of divine protection and providence.<p><b>and he was not killed</b><br>Joash's survival is a testament to God's faithfulness in preserving the Davidic line despite human attempts to thwart His plans. This preservation is a foreshadowing of the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who would come from this lineage.

So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.">2Chronicles 22:11</a>.)

At the time when the order for slaying the princes had been given, Jehosheba (or Jehoshabeath; Chronicles) concealed the infant Joash. The fact of his infancy caused him to be overlooked.

The Hebrew is, <span class= "ital">him and his nurse in the chamber of the beds; and they hid him from Athaliah, and he was not put to death.</span> Clearly the word, "and she put," supplied in Chronicles, has fallen out before this. The Targum and Syriac read, "and she hid him and his nurse," &c.<p><span class= "bld">In the bedchamber.</span>--<span class= "ital">In the chamber of beds, i.e.</span>, the room in the palace where the mattresses and the coverlets were kept, according to a custom still prevalent in the East.
