The context is a military campaign against Moab, which had rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. The inquiry reflects the need for strategic planning in warfare, a common practice in ancient times. The phrase also highlights the importance of seeking counsel and making decisions collaboratively, a principle seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>).<p><b>&#8220;By way of the Desert of Edom,&#8221; replied Joram.</b><br>Joram's response indicates the chosen route for the military campaign. The Desert of Edom, located to the south of the Dead Sea, was a challenging terrain, suggesting a strategic move to surprise the Moabites. Historically, Edom was a region often in conflict with Israel, yet at this time, it was under Judah's control, allowing safe passage. This route also underscores the alliance between Israel and Judah, despite their divided kingdoms. The choice of the desert path can be seen as a test of faith and endurance, reminiscent of Israel's wilderness journey in Exodus. The alliance and the chosen path reflect the complexities of political and military strategies in the ancient Near East.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram.htm">Jehoram (Joram) of Israel</a></b><br>The king of Israel who sought to join forces with Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom to fight against Moab.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God, who agreed to assist Jehoram in the battle against Moab.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_edom.htm">King of Edom</a></b><br>An unnamed king who allied with Israel and Judah in their campaign against Moab.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A neighboring nation that rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab, Jehoram's father.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/desert_of_edom.htm">Desert of Edom</a></b><br>The route chosen for the military campaign, a challenging and arid region that tested the faith and resolve of the allied kings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_godly_counsel.htm">Seeking Godly Counsel</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's involvement reminds us of the importance of seeking counsel from those who are faithful to God.

The query recognizes that route matters:<p>&#8226; Geography affects supply lines and morale.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, choosing a path without God&#8217;s guidance can end in disaster, as Asa learned when he relied on Syria instead of the LORD (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat had earlier sought prophetic direction before joining Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/22-5.htm">1 Kings 22:5</a>); his question here echoes that same caution.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By way of the Desert of Edom</b><p>Joram answers with a southern approach that skirts the Dead Sea, traveling through Edom&#8217;s arid wilderness:<p>&#8226; The route avoids Moab&#8217;s fortified northern border yet exposes the armies to water shortage, fulfilled in <a href="/2_kings/3-9.htm">2 Kings 3:9-10</a>.<p>&#8226; This hardship sets the stage for God&#8217;s miraculous provision (3:16-20), showing that even well-devised human plans still require divine intervention.<p>&#8226; Wilderness experiences frequently become arenas for God&#8217;s power&#8212;think of Israel at the Red Sea (<a href="/bsb/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>) or Jesus&#8217; temptation in the desert (<a href="/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>replied Joram</b><p>Joram&#8217;s response reflects leadership but also self-reliance.

The former was the shortest route for both kings. But Moab's strongest defences were on the north frontier, and the allies would be liable to attacks from the Syrians in Ramoth-gilead (<a href="/2_kings/8-28.htm" title="And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.">2Kings 8:28</a>). The longer and more difficult southern road may have been chosen partly on these grounds, and partly because Jehoshaphat wished to march as far as might be within his own territory, and to get a contingent from Edom, which was at this time subject to him (<a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm" title="Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.">1Kings 22:48</a>), and perhaps to hold it in check. Moreover, the Moabites were less likely to be on their guard on the southern border, which was more difficult of access.<p><span class= "bld">And he answered.</span>--<span class= "ital">Said</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, Jehoshaphat.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Which way shall we go up?</span> Jehoram asked Jehoshaphat's advice as to the plan of campaign. There 'were two ways in which Moab might be approached - the direct one across the Jordan and then southward through the country east of the Dead Sea to the Amen, which was the boundary between Moab and Israel; and a circuitous one through the desert west of the Red Sea, and across the Arabah south of it, then northwards through Northern Edom, to the brook Zered, or Wady-el- Ahsy, which was the boundary between Moab and Edom. If the former route were pursued, Moab would be entered on the north; if the latter, she would be attacked on the south. Jehoshaphat recommended the circuitous route. <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom</span>; probably for two reasons: Edom, though under a native king, was a dependency of Judah (<a href="/1_kings/22-47.htm">1 Kings 22:47</a>), and on passing through the Edomite country, an Edomite contingent might be added to the invading force; Moab, moreover, was mere likely to be surprised by an attack on this quarter, which was unusual, and from which she would not anticipate danger. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/3-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he asked,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1429;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
