This encounter is significant as it marks a turning point in Hazael's life and the history of Aram and Israel. Elisha, a successor of Elijah, is a prominent prophet in Israel, known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel. The meeting between Hazael and Elisha occurs during a time of political tension between Israel and Aram (modern-day Syria), highlighting the influence of prophets in political matters.<p><b>and went to his master,</b><br>Hazael returns to Ben-Hadad II, the king of Aram. This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Near Eastern courts, where officials served under the authority of a king. Ben-Hadad II is a historical figure known from both biblical and Assyrian records, indicating the interconnectedness of regional powers. The relationship between Hazael and Ben-Hadad is crucial, as it sets the stage for Hazael's eventual rise to power.<p><b>who asked him, &#8220;What did Elisha say to you?&#8221;</b><br>The king's inquiry shows his concern for Elisha's prophecy regarding his illness. In the ancient world, prophets were often consulted for divine insight, especially concerning health and political outcomes. This question underscores the king's reliance on prophetic words, reflecting the belief in the power of prophecy to influence royal decisions and the course of nations.<p><b>And he replied, &#8220;He told me that you would surely recover.&#8221;</b><br>Hazael's response is a partial truth, as Elisha had also foretold the king's death. This deception is pivotal, as it foreshadows Hazael's ambition and eventual usurpation of the throne. The phrase "surely recover" contrasts with the reality of Ben-Hadad's fate, illustrating the theme of human manipulation of divine messages. This moment is a turning point, leading to Hazael's fulfillment of Elisha's prophecy of becoming king, which aligns with God's sovereign plan despite human deceit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hazael.htm">Hazael</a></b><br>A servant of the king of Aram (Syria) who later becomes king himself.

Hazael fits the latter pattern.<p>&#8226; The trip back underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty: even pagan courts are arenas for the outworking of His word (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who asked him, &#8220;What did Elisha say to you?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s inquiry shows respect for the prophet&#8217;s credibility; even enemies of Israel feared Elisha&#8217;s insight (<a href="/2_kings/6-12.htm">2 Kings 6:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Ben-hadad&#8217;s question demonstrates how God&#8217;s truth pierces political boundaries (<a href="/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a>).<p>&#8226; It also reveals a moment of vulnerability: sickness has made the king eager for hope, echoing Ahaziah&#8217;s search for Elijah&#8217;s word in <a href="/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2&#8211;3</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he replied, &#8220;He told me that you would surely recover.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Hazael selectively reports Elisha&#8217;s message. Elisha had indeed said, &#8220;You will surely recover,&#8221; yet immediately added, &#8220;Nevertheless, the LORD has shown me that he will surely die&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/8-10.htm">2 Kings 8:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This half-truth exposes Hazael&#8217;s deceitful heart (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>) and foreshadows his violence in v. 15.<p>&#8226; The statement illustrates the danger of twisting God&#8217;s words for personal gain&#8212;Satan employed the same tactic in <a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a> and <a href="/matthew/4-6.htm">Matthew 4:6</a>.<p>&#8226; Though Ben-hadad hears encouraging news, the fuller prophecy will still come to pass, affirming the certainty of God&#8217;s word (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/8-14.htm">2 Kings 8:14</a> captures a pivotal moment: Hazael leaves God&#8217;s prophet, returns to his king, and offers a calculated half-truth. The verse unveils three themes&#8212;personal responsibility for revealed truth, the reach of God&#8217;s word into worldly power structures, and the peril of manipulating that word. While Ben-hadad hears only recovery, God&#8217;s complete prophecy marches on, soon elevating Hazael to the throne through treachery. The passage reminds us that every listener must steward God&#8217;s message honestly, for the Lord&#8217;s word remains sure whether embraced, ignored, or twisted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">That thou shouldest surely recover.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Thou wilt certainly live</span>, repeating Elisha's actual words, but <span class= "ital">not</span> the tone and gesture which accompanied them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee?
