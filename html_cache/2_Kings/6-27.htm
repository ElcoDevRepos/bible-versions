The king of Israel, likely Joram, acknowledges the limitations of human power and the necessity of divine intervention. This echoes the biblical theme that true deliverance comes from God alone, as seen in Psalms 121:1-2, where the psalmist looks to the Lord for help. The king's response also highlights a moment of desperation and recognition of human insufficiency, a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>where can I find help for you?</b><br>The rhetorical question underscores the helplessness of the king and the people. It suggests that without God's intervention, no earthly resource or strategy can provide salvation. This sentiment is mirrored in other biblical narratives, such as the plight of the Israelites in Egypt, where only God's power could deliver them from bondage (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>). The king's question also serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where reliance on God is paramount.<p><b>From the threshing floor or the winepress?&#8221;</b><br>Threshing floors and winepresses were symbols of agricultural abundance and prosperity in ancient Israel. However, during the siege, these places would be empty, symbolizing the famine and lack of resources. The mention of these locations highlights the severity of the situation, as they were typically associated with harvest and provision. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture to depict judgment or blessing, such as in <a href="/joel/2-24.htm">Joel 2:24</a>, where a future restoration is promised with overflowing threshing floors and winepresses. The king's mention of these places emphasizes the futility of seeking help from earthly means when divine intervention is absent.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel</a></b><br>The unnamed king during the time of the Aramean siege of Samaria, likely King Jehoram, who is faced with a dire situation and is approached by a desperate woman.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which is under siege by the Arameans, leading to severe famine and desperation among its inhabitants.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_desperate_woman.htm">The Desperate Woman</a></b><br>A woman who approaches the king with a grievous complaint, highlighting the extreme conditions and moral decay resulting from the siege.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whom the king references, acknowledging that ultimate help and deliverance can only come from Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/threshing_floor_and_winepress.htm">Threshing Floor and Winepress</a></b><br>Symbolic of agricultural abundance, these are mentioned rhetorically by the king to emphasize the lack of resources and human inability to provide help.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>The king's rhetorical question underscores the futility of relying on human resources in times of crisis.
