His role here highlights the importance of literacy and record-keeping in ancient Judah. The king referred to is Josiah, who reigned during a time of religious reform. This context is crucial as it sets the stage for the rediscovery of the Book of the Law, which would lead to significant religious reforms. The act of reporting to the king underscores the hierarchical structure of the kingdom and the importance of accountability in governance.<p><b>Your servants have paid out the money that was found in the temple</b><br>The money mentioned here was collected for the repair of the temple, a project initiated by King Josiah to restore the house of the LORD. This reflects the economic practices of the time, where funds were gathered for public works, especially religious ones. The temple, located in Jerusalem, was the central place of worship for the Israelites, and its maintenance was crucial for the religious life of the nation. The phrase also indicates a level of integrity and transparency in handling the funds, which is significant given the previous periods of corruption and idolatry in Judah.<p><b>and have put it into the hands of the workers and supervisors of the house of the LORD.</b><br>This phrase highlights the organized approach to the temple restoration project. The workers and supervisors were likely skilled laborers and overseers responsible for the physical repairs. This reflects the division of labor and the importance of skilled craftsmanship in ancient construction projects. The "house of the LORD" refers to Solomon's Temple, a central symbol of Israel's covenant relationship with God. The restoration of the temple can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate temple, the dwelling place of God with humanity. This act of restoration prefigures the redemptive work of Christ, who restores the broken relationship between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shaphan_the_scribe.htm">Shaphan the Scribe</a></b><br>A key figure in the court of King Josiah, Shaphan was responsible for reading the Book of the Law to the king and played a significant role in the religious reforms that followed.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_josiah.htm">King Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated significant religious reforms after the discovery of the Book of the Law in the temple.
