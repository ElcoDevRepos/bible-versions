The removal of these items signifies the end of the sacrificial system in Jerusalem at that time, highlighting the severity of the Babylonian conquest. This act fulfilled the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah about the impending judgment due to the people's disobedience.<p><b>shovels</b><br>Shovels were used for removing ashes from the altar, a necessary task to maintain the purity and function of the temple services. The taking of these items symbolizes the cessation of regular worship practices, emphasizing the complete disruption of religious life in Judah.<p><b>wick trimmers</b><br>Wick trimmers were used to maintain the lamps in the temple, ensuring they burned brightly. The removal of these tools indicates the extinguishing of the light of worship and the presence of God in the temple, a powerful image of spiritual desolation. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the spiritual darkness that would come over the nation.<p><b>dishes</b><br>Dishes in the temple were used for various offerings and rituals. Their confiscation represents the loss of the means to perform sacred duties, further illustrating the dismantling of the temple's function. This act underscores the thoroughness of the Babylonian destruction and the fulfillment of prophecies regarding the temple's desecration.<p><b>and all the articles of bronze used in the temple service</b><br>Bronze was a common material for temple articles, symbolizing strength and durability. The comprehensive removal of these items signifies the complete stripping away of the temple's glory and the fulfillment of God's judgment. This event connects to the broader biblical narrative of exile and restoration, as seen in the eventual return and rebuilding efforts led by figures like Ezra and Nehemiah.
