These groups were common during the time of Elijah and Elisha, serving as training centers for those called to prophetic ministry. Elisha, as the successor of Elijah, was a prominent leader and mentor to these prophets. This phrase highlights the communal and educational aspect of prophetic ministry in ancient Israel, where mentorship and learning were integral. The presence of such schools indicates a structured approach to maintaining and passing on the prophetic tradition.<p><b>Please take note that the place where we meet with you</b><br>The phrase suggests a regular gathering place for instruction and fellowship, indicating the importance of community and shared learning in the prophetic tradition. This location, likely a simple structure or open area, served as a hub for spiritual growth and guidance under Elisha's leadership. The request to "take note" implies respect and deference to Elisha's authority, acknowledging his role as a spiritual leader. This setting reflects the communal nature of ancient Israelite society, where learning and worship were often conducted in group settings.<p><b>is too small for us.</b><br>The statement about the space being "too small" indicates growth in the number of prophetic disciples, suggesting a successful ministry under Elisha's guidance. This growth can be seen as a sign of God's blessing and the increasing influence of the prophetic movement during this period. The need for a larger meeting place underscores the dynamic and expanding nature of the prophetic community, as well as the practical challenges of accommodating a growing group. This situation parallels other biblical instances where physical expansion is necessary due to divine blessing, such as the growth of the early church in Acts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_the_prophets.htm">Sons of the Prophets</a></b><br>A group of prophetic disciples or students who were under the mentorship of a leading prophet, in this case, Elisha.
