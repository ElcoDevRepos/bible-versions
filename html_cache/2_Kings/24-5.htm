His reign was marked by political turmoil and spiritual decline. He was placed on the throne by Pharaoh Necho of Egypt, indicating Judah's subservience to foreign powers. Jehoiakim's acts included heavy taxation and forced labor to pay tribute to Egypt and later Babylon, reflecting the oppressive conditions of his rule. His reign is characterized by a rejection of prophetic warnings, notably from Jeremiah, who condemned his idolatry and injustice.<p><b>along with all his accomplishments</b><br>Jehoiakim's accomplishments are often viewed negatively in the biblical narrative. He is known for building projects, possibly including the expansion of Jerusalem's walls, but these were achieved through exploitation. His reign saw the beginning of the Babylonian exile, as he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, leading to the first deportation of Jews to Babylon. His accomplishments are overshadowed by his failure to lead Judah in faithfulness to God, contrasting with the biblical ideal of a king who upholds justice and righteousness.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><br>This phrase suggests that a more detailed account of Jehoiakim's reign was recorded in a historical document now lost, known as the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. This book is distinct from the biblical Chronicles and served as a royal archive. The mention of this source indicates the historical practice of recording royal annals, similar to other ancient Near Eastern cultures. It underscores the biblical authors' reliance on historical records to compile the narrative, affirming the historical basis of the biblical account.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this period, known for his disobedience to God and his alliance with Egypt.

It reminds us that Scripture often gives only the highlights necessary for God&#8217;s redemptive narrative while pointing to fuller records elsewhere.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the acts of Jehoiakim</b><p>Jehoiakim&#8217;s &#8220;acts&#8221; include everything he did as Judah&#8217;s eighteenth king (<a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>). From the inspired record we know:<p>&#8226; He was placed on the throne by Pharaoh Necho and taxed the land to pay Egypt&#8217;s tribute (<a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; He &#8220;did evil in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/23-37.htm">2 Kings 23:37</a>), refusing covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226; In his fourth year, Nebuchadnezzar defeated Egypt and made Judah a vassal (<a href="/jeremiah/25-1.htm">Jeremiah 25:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; After three years Jehoiakim rebelled; God sent bands of Chaldeans, Arameans, Moabites, and Ammonites against him &#8220;to destroy Judah&#8221; in fulfilment of prophetic warning (<a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2&#8211;3</a>; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>).<p>Jeremiah paints an even darker picture: extortionate building projects, unjust bloodshed, and a godless funeral (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13&#8211;19</a>; 26:20&#8211;23).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with all his accomplishments</b><p>&#8220;Accomplishments&#8221; covers everything that might impress from a worldly standpoint&#8212;construction, diplomacy, or military maneuvers. Yet the biblical author leaves them unnamed, reminding us that earthly achievements cannot overshadow rebellion against God (<a href="/psalms/90-17.htm">Psalm 90:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>). From <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/36.htm">Jeremiah 36</a> we learn Jehoiakim brazenly cut up and burned the prophetic scroll, epitomizing his hard heart. Earth-bound gains did not count as true success.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are they not written</b><p>This rhetorical question, repeated throughout Kings (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/14-19.htm">1 Kings 14:19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-31.htm">2 Kings 15:31</a>), assumes the readers know where to find more data. It serves two purposes:<p>&#8226; Affirms there were ample historical sources, so the biblical account is not legend but anchored in verifiable history.<p>&#8226; Keeps the focus on God&#8217;s evaluation rather than human opinion; heaven&#8217;s verdict stands whether or not we consult other archives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><p>The &#8220;Book of the Chronicles&#8221; mentioned here is a royal annal distinct from the canonical 1&#8211;2 Chronicles, likely an official court record similar to Persian annals cited in <a href="/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1</a>. By pointing to that document, the author shows confidence that secular history corroborates inspired Scripture. Today the book is lost, yet its citation assures us the Bible was written in real time, addressing real kings, real politics, real sin (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>; <a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/24-5.htm">2 Kings 24:5</a> is more than a passing editorial note. It teaches that Jehoiakim&#8217;s life&#8212;though complex and recorded elsewhere&#8212;boils down to one decisive fact: he did evil and brought judgment on Judah. Scripture selectively records what matters for God&#8217;s purposes, but it does so within a framework of genuine history. The verse therefore invites us to trust the reliability of God&#8217;s Word and to measure our own &#8220;accomplishments&#8221; by the Lord&#8217;s standards, not by earthly chronicles.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim . . .</span>--Assuming with Hitzig that the passage <a href="/context/habakkuk/2-9.htm" title="Woe to him that covets an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!">Habakkuk 2:9-14</a> refers to him, we gather that he severely oppressed his people by his exactions of forced labour upon the defences of Jerusalem.
