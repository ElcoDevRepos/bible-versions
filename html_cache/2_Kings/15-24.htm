The "evil" refers to actions contrary to God's commandments, often involving idolatry and injustice. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" underscores God's omniscience and the accountability of leaders to divine standards. This evaluation is a recurring theme in the books of Kings, highlighting the spiritual decline of Israel and Judah.<p><b>and did not turn away from the sins</b><br>This suggests a continuation and persistence in sinful behavior, indicating a lack of repentance or reform. The concept of "turning away" is significant in biblical theology, often associated with repentance and returning to God. The failure to turn away from sin reflects a hardened heart and a rejection of God's call to righteousness. This phrase also implies a missed opportunity for redemption and change.<p><b>that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit</b><br>Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, is infamous for establishing idol worship, specifically the golden calves at Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). His actions set a precedent for idolatry that plagued Israel throughout its history. The phrase highlights the enduring influence of Jeroboam's sin, which became a benchmark for evaluating subsequent kings.

Like Saul before him (<a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24-26</a>), Pekahiah&#8217;s reign is summed up in one damning sentence because character, not circumstance, defines a life before God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the sight of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s deeds took place &#8220;in the sight of the LORD,&#8221; underscoring divine omniscience (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Public opinion in Samaria may have been mixed, but heaven&#8217;s verdict was settled. Similar language is used of Judah&#8217;s kings (e.g., <a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>), showing that the northern and southern kingdoms were judged by the same ruler of heaven and earth.<p>&#8226; This phrase also warns every reader that no action is hidden; God observes national policy and personal choices alike (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and did not turn away</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Turning&#8221; is the Old Testament picture of repentance (<a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30-32</a>; <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>). Pekahiah refused the course correction his predecessors ignored as well (<a href="/2_kings/14-24.htm">2 Kings 14:24</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s patience had given Israel repeated opportunities&#8212;through prophets like Amos and Hosea&#8212;to change direction (<a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6-11</a>; <a href="/hosea/14-1.htm">Hosea 14:1-2</a>). Pekahiah&#8217;s refusal shows deliberate persistence, not mere ignorance.<p>&#8226; The line also highlights that repentance is more than regret; it is an about-face that Pekahiah never made, echoing warnings Jesus later issued about fruitless lives (<a href="/luke/13-3.htm">Luke 13:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit</b><p>&#8226; Jeroboam I introduced golden-calf worship at Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). Every northern king after him, except none, walked that same idolatrous path.<p>&#8226; By clinging to Jeroboam&#8217;s precedent, Pekahiah reinforced national apostasy, leading future generations deeper into judgment (<a href="/2_kings/17-21.htm">2 Kings 17:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Idolatry always spreads; leaders who tolerate it &#8220;cause Israel to commit&#8221; sin, not merely engage privately (<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse therefore pinpoints the root problem: institutionalized false worship that looked convenient and patriotic but contradicted God&#8217;s explicit command to worship only in Jerusalem (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Pekahiah&#8217;s reign is etched in Scripture with a single verdict: he practiced evil, lived under God&#8217;s watchful eye, refused to repent, and perpetuated Jeroboam&#8217;s idolatry.
