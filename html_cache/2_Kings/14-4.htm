These locations were prevalent in ancient Israel and Judah, despite God's command to worship exclusively at the temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-5</a>). The persistence of these sites indicates a failure to fully adhere to God's law, reflecting a recurring theme of partial obedience among the kings of Israel and Judah. This phrase highlights the incomplete religious reforms during the reign of King Amaziah, who, despite doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord, did not remove these unauthorized worship sites (<a href="/2_kings/14-3.htm">2 Kings 14:3</a>). The high places often became centers for idolatry, which was a significant issue throughout Israel's history, leading to spiritual decline and eventual judgment.<p><b>and the people continued sacrificing and burning incense on the high places</b><br>This practice of sacrificing and burning incense on high places was a syncretistic blend of Yahweh worship with Canaanite religious customs. Sacrifices and incense were integral parts of worship, intended to honor God, but when performed at unauthorized sites, they represented disobedience and a deviation from prescribed worship. The people's continued use of these sites suggests a deep-seated cultural and religious attachment to local traditions, which often conflicted with the centralized worship God commanded. This behavior is reminiscent of the Israelites' earlier struggles with idolatry, as seen in the time of the Judges (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>). The persistence of high places serves as a reminder of the human tendency to compromise and the challenge of maintaining pure worship. It also foreshadows the eventual downfall of both Israel and Judah, as their failure to fully commit to God's commands led to their exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>; <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25:1-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>- King of Judah during this time, who did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, but not wholeheartedly.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places.htm">High Places</a></b><br>- Elevated sites where people engaged in worship, often associated with idolatry and practices contrary to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>- The southern kingdom of Israel, where Amaziah reigned.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificing_and_burning_incense.htm">Sacrificing and Burning Incense</a></b><br>- Acts of worship that were supposed to be conducted in the temple in Jerusalem, but were being improperly performed at the high places.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>- Continued in practices that were not fully aligned with God's commands, reflecting a partial obedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/partial_obedience_is_disobedience.htm">Partial Obedience is Disobedience</a></b><br>Amaziah's failure to remove the high places demonstrates that partial obedience to God is not enough.

<a href="/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s standard is complete conformity to His commands, not selective compliance (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-32.htm">Deuteronomy 12:32</a>; <a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the high places</b><p>- High places were elevated sites first used by Canaanites and later adopted by Israel for worship (<a href="/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2</a>).<p>- Even when sacrifices there were directed toward the LORD, they violated His clear instruction to worship only at the chosen place&#8212;ultimately the temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-5</a>;

Amaziah&#8217;s reign had commendable aspects, yet he left the high places intact. Because those unauthorized sites remained, the people persisted in worship that directly contradicted God&#8217;s clear command to gather at the temple. The verse reminds us that genuine faithfulness means removing every rival to God&#8217;s exclusive worship&#8212;anything less invites compromise and long-term spiritual decline.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Howbeit.</span>--The same word was rendered "yet" in the last verse.
