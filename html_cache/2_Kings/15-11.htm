His reign was short, lasting only six months, and is noted for its instability and violence. The phrase "the rest of the acts" suggests that there were additional deeds and events during his reign that are not detailed in the biblical narrative. This is a common biblical expression indicating that the recorded history in the Bible is selective and not exhaustive.<p><b>they are indeed written</b><br>This phrase underscores the practice of recording royal histories in ancient times. It implies that there was a more comprehensive account of Zechariah's reign available to the original audience, which was not included in the biblical text. This reflects the historical method of documenting the reigns of kings, which was common in the ancient Near East.<p><b>in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</b><br>This book is not the same as the biblical books of 1 and 2 Chronicles. It is a separate historical record that is frequently referenced in the books of Kings. The existence of such a record suggests that the kings of Israel maintained official annals or records of their reigns, similar to other ancient cultures. This practice provided a source for the biblical authors to draw from when compiling the historical narratives found in the Bible. The mention of this book highlights the historical context of the biblical narrative and the importance of written records in preserving history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>The king of Israel, son of Jeroboam II, and the last of Jehu's dynasty.
