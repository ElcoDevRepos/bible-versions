His ministry was marked by numerous miracles and a strong emphasis on the power of God. Elisha's role as a prophet was to convey God's messages to the people and the kings of Israel, often calling them back to faithfulness. His actions in this chapter are part of God's plan to bring judgment on the house of Ahab.<p><b>summoned one of the sons of the prophets</b><br>The "sons of the prophets" were members of prophetic communities or guilds that existed in Israel. These groups were likely schools or associations where individuals were trained in the prophetic tradition. They played a significant role in maintaining the spiritual life of Israel during times of apostasy. This particular son of the prophets was chosen for a specific mission, indicating the trust and authority Elisha had over these groups.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;Tuck your cloak under your belt</b><br>This phrase indicates readiness and urgency. In ancient times, long garments were tucked into the belt to allow for quick movement, often in preparation for travel or action. This instruction suggests that the task at hand required swiftness and decisiveness, reflecting the seriousness of the mission.<p><b>take this flask of oil</b><br>Oil in the Bible often symbolizes the Holy Spirit and is used for anointing, signifying consecration and empowerment by God. The use of oil here is significant as it is meant for anointing Jehu, setting him apart for a divine purpose. Anointing with oil was a common practice for kings and priests, indicating God's choice and blessing.<p><b>and go to Ramoth-gilead</b><br>Ramoth-gilead was a strategically important city located east of the Jordan River. It was a site of conflict between Israel and Aram (Syria) and had been a focal point in previous battles. The city's mention here is significant as it was a military outpost, and Jehu, who was to be anointed, was a commander in the army stationed there. This location sets the stage for the political and military upheaval that would follow Jehu's anointing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha_the_prophet.htm">Elisha the Prophet</a></b><br>A prominent prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_the_prophets.htm">Sons of the Prophets</a></b><br>A group or school of prophets who were disciples or followers of major prophets like Elisha, often involved in prophetic ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/ramoth-gilead.htm">Ramoth-gilead</a></b><br>A city of refuge in the territory of Gad, east of the Jordan River, significant in Israel's military and prophetic history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/flask_of_oil.htm">Flask of Oil</a></b><br>Symbolic of anointing and consecration, often used in the Old Testament to set apart individuals for God's purposes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tucking_cloak_into_belt.htm">Tucking Cloak into Belt</a></b><br>A cultural practice indicating readiness for action or travel, symbolizing urgency and preparedness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/readiness_for_god's_call.htm">Readiness for God's Call</a></b><br>Just as the son of the prophet was instructed to prepare for his mission, believers should be spiritually ready and willing to act when God calls.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_anointing.htm">The Role of Anointing</a></b><br>Anointing with oil in the Old Testament signifies God's choice and empowerment.
