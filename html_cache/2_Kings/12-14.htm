The context here is King Joash's initiative to restore the temple, which had been neglected and damaged over time, particularly during the reign of Athaliah when Baal worship was prominent. The decision to pay the workers directly reflects a practical and honest approach to ensure the funds were used appropriately. This method of direct payment can be seen as a precursor to modern accountability practices. It also highlights the importance of stewardship and integrity in handling resources dedicated to God's work, a principle echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>, which emphasizes faithfulness in stewardship.<p><b>and with it they repaired the house of the LORD</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The repairs were necessary due to the neglect and desecration it suffered, particularly under the influence of idolatrous practices. This restoration effort symbolizes a return to proper worship and reverence for God. The act of repairing the temple can be seen as a type of spiritual renewal, paralleling the New Testament call for believers to be temples of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>). The physical restoration of the temple foreshadows the ultimate restoration and redemption brought by Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), signifying the new covenant and the indwelling of God's presence in believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>King of Judah who initiated repairs to the temple, demonstrating a commitment to restoring the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_of_the_lord.htm">The Temple of the LORD</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, which had fallen into disrepair and needed restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests_and_levites.htm">Priests and Levites</a></b><br>Religious leaders responsible for the temple's upkeep and the collection of funds for its repair.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/workers/repairers.htm">Workers/Repairers</a></b><br>Skilled laborers who were entrusted with the funds to carry out the physical repairs of the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada_the_priest.htm">Jehoiada the Priest</a></b><br>The high priest who played a significant role in guiding King Joash and ensuring the proper use of funds for temple repairs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_of_resources.htm">Stewardship of Resources</a></b><br>The passage highlights the importance of using resources wisely and faithfully for God's purposes.

Rather than diverting the silver for ornamental pieces or palace expenses (see <a href="/2_kings/12-13.htm">2 Kings 12:13</a>), the leadership redirected it to a far more pressing purpose. This echoes Moses&#8217; earlier priority in <a href="/exodus/36-3.htm">Exodus 36:3&#8211;7</a>, where gifts brought for the tabernacle were funneled straight into construction. The passage reminds us that resources entrusted for God&#8217;s work must be used for God&#8217;s work&#8212;nothing less, nothing more.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It was paid to those doing the work</b><p>&#8226; Skilled laborers received the funds directly&#8212;carpenters, masons, stone-cutters, and suppliers of timber and quarried stone (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-12.htm">2 Chronicles 24:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; By compensating the workers, Joash followed the principle later articulated in <a href="/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>: &#8220;The worker is worthy of his wages.&#8221; Fair payment protected the integrity of the project and honored those who served.<p>&#8226; Verses 5&#8211;7 of <a href="/bsb/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a> show a similar model a century later under Josiah, where money was placed in the hands of trustworthy supervisors who then paid the craftsmen. Scripture repeatedly highlights transparency and accountability in stewardship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With it they repaired the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The temple had suffered years of neglect under Athaliah&#8217;s reign (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>). Rebuilding re-centered Judah&#8217;s worship life, just as rebuilding the wall under Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/2-5.htm">Nehemiah 2:5</a>; 4:6) later re-centered Jerusalem&#8217;s security and identity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/haggai/1-4.htm">Haggai 1:4&#8211;8</a> rebukes post-exilic Jews for living in paneled houses while God&#8217;s house lay in ruins. Joash&#8217;s repairs pre-figure that message: honoring God&#8217;s dwelling signals reverence for God Himself.<p>&#8226; Practical upkeep of a physical sanctuary never replaces spiritual devotion (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>), but it visibly testifies to it. When the temple stands strong, it proclaims that the Lord&#8217;s presence is valued above all.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/12-14.htm">2 Kings 12:14</a> shows faithful stewardship: offerings meant for God&#8217;s house were not siphoned off for secondary uses but handed to skilled laborers, resulting in real, measurable restoration. The verse commends transparent management, fair wages, and a heart that prioritizes God&#8217;s dwelling&#8212;principles that still instruct today&#8217;s believers in handling resources and honoring the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">But they gave that to the workmen.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">for to the doers of the work they used to give it, and they used to repair, &c.</span> In Chronicles it is added that, <span class= "ital">after the repairs were finished</span>, the money that was left was applied to the purpose of making "spoons and vessels of gold and silver" for the house of the Lord.
