The "hill" likely refers to a secluded place near the city, possibly a location where Gehazi could discreetly manage the gifts he had deceitfully acquired. Hills often served as places of significance in biblical narratives, symbolizing moments of decision or revelation. This setting underscores Gehazi's attempt to conceal his actions from Elisha, highlighting the theme of hidden sin.<p><b>he took the gifts from the servants</b><br>Gehazi's actions here are a direct result of his greed and deception. He had pursued Naaman, the Syrian commander, under false pretenses to obtain gifts that Elisha had refused. This act of taking the gifts signifies a breach of trust and integrity, contrasting with Elisha's earlier refusal to accept any reward for the healing of Naaman. The gifts, which included silver and garments, symbolize the material temptation that led Gehazi astray.<p><b>and stored them in the house</b><br>By storing the gifts in the house, Gehazi attempts to hide his wrongdoing. This act of concealment is reminiscent of Achan's sin in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, where hidden spoils led to dire consequences. The house represents a place of supposed safety and secrecy, yet it becomes a witness to Gehazi's sin. This phrase highlights the futility of trying to hide sin from God, who sees all.<p><b>Then he dismissed the men</b><br>Gehazi's dismissal of the servants indicates his desire to cover up his actions completely. By sending them away, he removes any witnesses to his deceit. This action reflects a common biblical theme where individuals attempt to manage the consequences of their sin through further deception. It also underscores Gehazi's isolation in his sin, as he distances himself from others who might hold him accountable.<p><b>and they departed</b><br>The departure of the men signifies the temporary success of Gehazi's scheme. However, it also foreshadows the impending judgment and exposure of his sin. This moment of departure is a turning point, as Gehazi believes he has successfully hidden his actions. Yet, it serves as a reminder that human plans cannot thwart divine justice, as Gehazi's sin will soon be revealed by Elisha, illustrating the biblical principle that sin will ultimately be brought to light.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gehazi.htm">Gehazi</a></b><br>The servant of Elisha, the prophet.

Gehazi waits until he is out of view&#8212;echoing how sin often seeks privacy (<a href="/luke/12-3.htm">Luke 12:3</a>; <a href="/job/24-15.htm">Job 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; His choice of location shows conscious planning. He is already thinking through how to hide what he is about to do (<a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, hills around Elisha were scenes of revelation, not secrecy (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). Gehazi flips that pattern, turning a place of spiritual insight into one of deception.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He took the gifts from the servants</b><p>Gehazi &#8220;took the gifts from the servants,&#8221; accepting what Elisha had refused (<a href="/2_kings/5-16.htm">2 Kings 5:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The action violates the prophetic witness that healing is God&#8217;s free grace (<a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Achan seizing Jericho&#8217;s spoil (<a href="/joshua/7-20.htm">Joshua 7:20&#8211;21</a>) and Ananias keeping back part of the sale (<a href="/acts/5-2.htm">Acts 5:2</a>), Gehazi&#8217;s grasping hand signals a heart already corrupted by greed (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>).<p>&#8226; By taking the silver and garments, he aligns himself with Naaman&#8217;s old worldview of buying favor, rather than Elisha&#8217;s declaration that &#8220;there is a prophet in Israel&#8221; who serves the living God free of charge (<a href="/2_kings/5-8.htm">2 Kings 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He stored them in the house</b><p>Next, he &#8220;stored them in the house,&#8221; hiding the ill-gotten items.<p>&#8226; Concealment shows forethought; he plans to integrate the gifts into his life later, hoping no one will notice (<a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The house&#8212;meant for family blessing&#8212;becomes a hiding place for sin, recalling Achan burying treasure in his tent (<a href="/joshua/7-21.htm">Joshua 7:21</a>) and Jesus&#8217; warning not to &#8220;store up for yourselves treasures on earth&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19</a>).<p>&#8226; What is hidden in private soon endangers every occupant of the household (<a href="/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He dismissed the men, and they departed</b><p>Finally, &#8220;he dismissed the men, and they departed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Removing the witnesses is an effort to seal the cover-up (<a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Gehazi assumes success because human observers are gone, yet &#8220;nothing in all creation is hidden from God&#8217;s sight&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; His smooth dismissal contrasts sharply with Elisha&#8217;s earlier transparency toward Naaman (<a href="/2_kings/5-9.htm">2 Kings 5:9&#8211;10</a>). What began with a secret lie now leads to complete isolation, a path <a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a> warns against.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/5-24.htm">2 Kings 5:24</a> captures the anatomy of hidden sin: choosing a secluded spot, grasping what God forbids, hiding it at home, and dismissing witnesses. Gehazi&#8217;s calculated steps remind us that secrecy cannot outwit divine omniscience. What he thought was safely stashed soon brought public judgment (<a href="/2_kings/5-25.htm">2 Kings 5:25&#8211;27</a>). The verse calls believers to honest, open lives that reflect God&#8217;s free grace, rejecting any temptation to profit from what He intends as a gift.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">The tower.</span>--Heb., the '<span class= "ital">?phel</span>, the mound, on which the prophet's house may have stood. There would be no window in the exterior wall from which Gehazi and his companions might have been observed approaching. Perhaps, however, a fortified hill, forming part of the system of defences surrounding Samaria, like the Ophel at Jerusalem, is to be understood. (Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm" title="He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.">2Chronicles 27:3</a>.) Elisha's house lay within the city wall (<a href="/2_kings/6-30.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by on the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within on his flesh.">2Kings 6:30</a>, seq.).

(Comp. <a href="/isaiah/32-14.htm" title="Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;">Isaiah 32:14</a>, and Cheyne's Note; <a href="/micah/4-8.htm" title="And you, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.">Micah 4:8</a> : "And thou, O tower of the flock; O mound of the daughter of Zion.")
