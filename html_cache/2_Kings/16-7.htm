This action reflects a significant political and spiritual decision, as it indicates Ahaz's reliance on a foreign power rather than trusting in God for deliverance. Historically, Assyria was a dominant empire during this period, known for its military prowess and expansionist policies. The decision to seek Assyrian help would have long-term consequences for Judah, as it led to increased Assyrian influence and eventual subjugation.<p><b>saying, &#8220;I am your servant and your son.</b><br>By referring to himself as a "servant" and "son," Ahaz is expressing submission and loyalty to Tiglath-pileser. This language indicates a vassal relationship, where Ahaz acknowledges the superiority of the Assyrian king. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such terms were often used in treaties to denote allegiance and dependency. This act of submission contrasts with the biblical ideal of Israelite kings relying on God as their ultimate sovereign.<p><b>Come up and save me</b><br>Ahaz's plea for salvation from Tiglath-pileser highlights his desperation and lack of faith in God's protection. The request for military intervention underscores the immediate threat faced by Judah. Biblically, this reliance on human power rather than divine intervention is often criticized, as seen in other scriptures where trust in God is emphasized as the true source of deliverance (e.g., <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><b>from the hands of the kings of Aram and Israel</b><br>The kings of Aram (Syria) and Israel formed a coalition against Judah, posing a significant threat to Ahaz's reign. This alliance is part of the Syro-Ephraimite War, where Rezin of Aram and Pekah of Israel sought to pressure Judah into joining their resistance against Assyria. The geopolitical tension of the time is evident, as smaller states navigated the pressures of larger empires and regional conflicts.<p><b>who are rising up against me.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase indicates the active aggression and imminent danger posed by the coalition of Aram and Israel. This conflict is a pivotal moment in the history of Judah, as it leads to Ahaz's controversial decision to seek Assyrian aid. The rising threat also fulfills the prophetic warnings given by Isaiah, who advised Ahaz to trust in God rather than foreign alliances (<a href="/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7:1-9</a>). This situation foreshadows the eventual downfall of both Aram and Israel, as Assyria would later conquer them, fulfilling God's judgment against these nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>King of Judah, known for his unfaithfulness to God and reliance on foreign powers for security.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tiglath-pileser.htm">Tiglath-pileser</a></b><br>King of Assyria, a powerful ruler who expanded the Assyrian Empire and was often involved in the politics of the region.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram</a></b><br>A kingdom located in modern-day Syria, often at odds with Israel and Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, distinct from Judah, often in conflict with its southern neighbor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/messengers.htm">Messengers</a></b><br>Representatives sent by Ahaz to communicate his plea for help to the Assyrian king.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reliance_on_god_vs._human_alliances.htm">Reliance on God vs. Human Alliances</a></b><br>Ahaz's decision to seek help from Assyria rather than trusting in God serves as a cautionary tale about where we place our trust.

(<span class= "ital">Robertson Smith.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> <span class="accented">- Expedition of Tiglath-pileser against Pekah and Rezin</span>. In the extremity of his danger, when the confederacy had declared itself, or perhaps later, when he had suffered terrible defeats, and was about. to be besieged in his capital (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">2 Chronicles 28:5, 6</a>), Ahaz invoked the aid of Tiglath-pileser, sent him all the treasure on which he could lay his hands (ver. 8), offered to place himself and his kingdom under the Assyrian monarch's suzerainty, and entreated him to come and "save him out of the hands" of his enemies (ver. 7). Humanly speaking, he might be justified. He had not called in one foreign power until Pekah had called in another. There was no other prospect (again humanly speaking) of escape. But, had he accepted the offers of <a href="/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4-16</a>, and relied wholly on Jehovah, his position would have been far better. However, he was unable to see this; he made his application; and Tiglath-pileser "came up," and utterly crushed the Syro-Israelite confederacy (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria, saying.</span> This appeal to man rather than to God, this trust in "an arm of flesh," was exactly what Isaiah had been endeavoring to prevent, what he viewed as unfaithfulness, and as inevitably drawing down God's wrath both upon king and kingdom. Ahaz was young, was weak, and had no doubt a large body of advisers, who considered the prophet to be a fanatic, who had no belief in supernatural aid, and who thought that in any emergency recourse was to be had to the measures which human prudence and human policy dictated. The aid of Tiglath-pileser seemed to them, under the circumstances, the only thing that could save them; and they persuaded the weak prince to adopt their views. <span class="cmt_word">I am thy servant and thy son.</span> The offer of submission was unmistakable. "Servant," in the language of the time, meant "slave." Complete subjection, enrollment among Assyria's feudatories, the entire loss of independence, was well understood to be the price that had to be paid for Assyria's protection. Ahaz and his worldly advisers were prepared to pay it. They surrendered themselves, body and soul, into the hands of the great world-power of the period. <span class="cmt_word">Come up, and save me out of the hand of the King of Syria, and out of the hand of the King of Israel, which rise up against me.</span> Syria is put forward as at once the more formidable of the two foes, and the one most open to Assyrian attack. Already Damascus had been more than once menaced by Assyrian armies ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 113, 115, 116), while the kingdom of Samaria had only suffered at her extremities (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>).
