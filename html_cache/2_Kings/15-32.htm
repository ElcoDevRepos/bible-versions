Pekah, son of Remaliah, was a king of Israel who came to power through a coup, overthrowing Pekahiah. His reign is marked by political instability and conflict with Assyria. The reference to Pekah's second year helps to synchronize the events in Judah with those in Israel, providing a chronological framework for understanding the historical context. This period was characterized by significant tension between the two kingdoms, often leading to alliances with foreign powers.<p><b>Jotham son of Uzziah became king of Judah</b><br>Jotham's ascension to the throne marks a continuation of the Davidic line in Judah, emphasizing the stability and continuity of Judah's monarchy compared to Israel's frequent changes in leadership. Jotham was the son of Uzziah (also known as Azariah), who was a generally good king but was struck with leprosy for his pride. Jotham is noted for his righteous reign, following in the ways of his father but avoiding his mistakes. His rule is characterized by building projects and military successes, as recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/27.htm">2 Chronicles 27</a>. Jotham's reign is a period of relative peace and prosperity for Judah, contrasting with the turmoil in Israel.
