He became king after assassinating Ben-hadad I, as prophesied by Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/8-7.htm">2 Kings 8:7-15</a>). Hazael's reign was marked by military campaigns against Israel and Judah, fulfilling God's judgment against Israel for their idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32-33</a>). His death marks the end of a period of oppression for Israel, as Hazael was a formidable adversary. Historically, Hazael is also mentioned in Assyrian records, confirming his prominence and the threat he posed to neighboring nations.<p><b>his son Ben-hadad reigned in his place</b><br>Ben-hadad, likely Ben-hadad III, succeeded Hazael. The name "Ben-hadad" was a dynastic title used by Aramean kings, similar to "Pharaoh" in Egypt. This transition of power is significant as it marks a shift in the political landscape. Ben-hadad's reign is noted for the weakening of Aram's power, which allowed Israel to regain territories lost during Hazael's campaigns (<a href="/2_kings/13-25.htm">2 Kings 13:25</a>). This change in leadership fulfilled Elisha's prophecy that Israel would recover cities from Aram (<a href="/2_kings/13-17.htm">2 Kings 13:17-19</a>). The cyclical nature of Israel's oppression and deliverance is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, illustrating God's sovereignty and faithfulness despite Israel's unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hazael.htm">Hazael</a></b><br>King of Aram (Syria) who was an adversary of Israel.

Hazael&#8217;s life and Ben-hadad&#8217;s reign unfold exactly within the boundaries God set, advancing both discipline and deliverance for Israel.
