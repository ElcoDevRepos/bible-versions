The Assyrians were known for their military prowess and psychological warfare, often using intimidation to weaken their enemies' resolve. The claim of having a strategy and strength for war is challenged here, suggesting that Judah's military capabilities are insufficient against the might of Assyria. Historically, Assyria was a dominant empire during this period, known for its advanced military tactics and formidable army. This phrase highlights the futility of relying solely on human strength and strategy without divine support, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>but these are empty words</b><br>The Rabshakeh dismisses Judah's confidence as baseless, implying that their plans and preparations are ineffective. This reflects a common biblical theme where human boasting and self-reliance are contrasted with the need for dependence on God. In the broader biblical narrative, empty words often signify promises or boasts that lack substance or divine backing. This can be seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>, which states, "There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the LORD."<p><b>In whom are you now trusting</b><br>This question challenges the foundation of Judah's confidence. Trust is a central theme in the Bible, often associated with faith in God rather than in human alliances or resources. The Assyrian envoy is questioning whether Hezekiah's trust is in Egypt, a common but unreliable ally, or in the LORD, the God of Israel. This echoes the biblical principle found in <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, "Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God."<p><b>that you have rebelled against me?</b><br>The rebellion mentioned here refers to Hezekiah's refusal to continue paying tribute to Assyria, an act of defiance against the empire's authority. Historically, this rebellion was a significant political and military risk, as Assyria was known for its brutal suppression of insubordination. Theologically, this rebellion can be seen as an act of faith, as Hezekiah sought to rely on God's deliverance rather than submit to foreign oppression. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative of God's people being called to trust in Him rather than in oppressive powers, as seen in the Exodus story where God delivers Israel from Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who is known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to rid Judah of idolatry.

The verse challenges us to ground every plan, every source of confidence, and every act of courage in the living Word that never fails.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Thou sayest (but they are but vain Words).</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">thou hast said</span>--<span class= "ital">a mere lip-word it was</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> insincere language, an utterance which thou knewest to be false.

We must suppose that Sennacherib has either heard from his spies that Hezekiah is speaking to the people as he represents him to be speaking, or conjectures what he is likely to say. According to the writer of Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-7.htm">2 Chronicles 32:7, 8</a>), what he did say was very different. He neither boasted of "counsel" nor of material "strength;" but simply said, "There be more with us than with him: with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles." <span class="cmt_word">I have counsel and strength for the war.</span> Sennacherib imagines that Hezekiah's real trust is in the "fleshly arm" of Egypt, and in the counselors who have advised and brought about the alliance. And perhaps he is not far wrong. Hezekiah, it would seem, "halted between two opinions." He hoped for aid from Egypt; but, if it failed, then he hoped for the Divine help promised by Isaiah. <span class="cmt_word">Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/18-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You claim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1433;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[to have] a strategy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1510;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#183;&#7779;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6098.htm">Strong's 6098: </a> </span><span class="str2">Advice, plan, prudence</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and strength</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7713;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
