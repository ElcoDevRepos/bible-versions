His reign follows that of his father, Jehoram, who had led the nation into idolatry. The age of twenty-two suggests a lack of experience, which may have contributed to his short and troubled reign. This period in Judah's history is marked by political instability and spiritual decline, as the influence of the house of Ahab in Israel extended into Judah.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem one year</b><br>Ahaziah's brief reign of one year indicates a time of significant upheaval. His short rule is a consequence of the alliances and enmities formed by his predecessors. Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, was the center of worship and governance, yet during Ahaziah's reign, it was also a place of political intrigue and religious compromise. His reign was cut short by his involvement in the conflicts between Israel and Aram, leading to his death.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Athaliah</b><br>Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, brought the influence of the northern kingdom's idolatry into Judah. Her marriage to Jehoram was likely a political alliance, but it also introduced the worship of Baal into Judah. Athaliah's role as queen mother was significant, as she later seized power for herself, furthering the apostasy in Judah. Her influence on Ahaziah would have been substantial, steering him towards the practices of her family in Israel.<p><b>the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel</b><br>Omri, a powerful and influential king of Israel, established a dynasty known for its political strength and idolatrous practices. His legacy included the construction of Samaria and the establishment of alliances through marriage, such as that of his son Ahab to Jezebel. Athaliah, as Omri's granddaughter, represents the continuation of this legacy. The mention of Omri highlights the political and religious entanglements between Israel and Judah during this period, as well as the ongoing struggle between the worship of Yahweh and the idolatry introduced by Omri's descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaziah.htm">Ahaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who began his reign at the age of twenty-two.

The writer of Chronicles says, "two and forty" (<a href="/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a>), which is absolutely impossible, since his father was but forty when he died (see ver. 17, and setup. <a href="/2_chronicles/21-5.htm">2 Chronicles 21:5, 20</a>). Even "two and twenty" is a more advanced age than we should have expected, since Ahaziah was the youngest of Jehoram's sons (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>); he must therefore have been born in his father's nineteenth year. Yet he had several elder brothers (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/22-1.htm">2 Chronicles 22:1</a>)! To explain this, we have to remember <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the early age at which marriage is contracted in the East (twelve years); and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the fact that each prince had, besides his wife, several concubines.

He was, no doubt, regarded of a sort of second founder of the kingdom of Israel, having been the first monarch to establish anything like a stable dynasty. His "statutes" were looked upon as the fundamental laws of the kingdom, and were "kept" down to the time of its destruction (<a href="/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>). Foreigners knew Samaria as <span class="accented">Beth</span>. <span class="accented">Khumri</span>, or "the house of Omri." He is the only Israelite king mentioned by name on the Moabite Stone (line 5), and the earliest mentioned in the inscriptions of Assyria. Even Jehu, who put an end to his dynasty, was regarded by the Assyrians as his descendant, and known under the designation of" Yahua, the son of Khnmri" (Black Obelisk, epig. 2.).
