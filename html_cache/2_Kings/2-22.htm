Jericho, located near the Jordan River, was a significant city in biblical history, known for its conquest by Joshua. The water source was previously causing death and unfruitfulness, which could symbolize spiritual barrenness. The healing of the waters signifies God's power to restore and bring life. This miracle demonstrates the enduring nature of God's intervention, as the waters remained healthy long after the event, emphasizing the lasting impact of divine action.<p><b>according to the word spoken by Elisha</b><br>Elisha, the successor of Elijah, was a prophet known for performing miracles that often prefigured the works of Jesus Christ. His word, empowered by God, brought about the healing of the waters. This highlights the authority of God's prophets and the power of spoken word in biblical tradition. Elisha's role as a prophet is crucial, as he acts as a mediator of God's will, similar to how Jesus is seen as the ultimate mediator in the New Testament. The fulfillment of Elisha's word underscores the reliability and truth of prophetic declarations in Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet and successor of Elijah, known for performing miracles and being a powerful voice for God in Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>A city in the Jordan Valley, known for its historical significance and the miraculous fall of its walls during Joshua's conquest.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_waters_of_jericho.htm">The Waters of Jericho</a></b><br>The water source in Jericho that was previously unhealthy and causing harm to the land and its people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle_of_healing_the_waters.htm">The Miracle of Healing the Waters</a></b><br>Elisha performs a miracle by purifying the waters of Jericho, making them healthy and life-sustaining.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_the_lord.htm">The Word of the Lord</a></b><br>The authority and power behind Elisha's actions, emphasizing the divine source of the miracle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>Elisha's miracle demonstrates the transformative power of God's word.
