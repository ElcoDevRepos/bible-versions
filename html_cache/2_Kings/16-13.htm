The burnt offering and grain offering were central to Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God (Leviticus 1, 2). However, Ahaz's actions reflect a departure from the prescribed worship in the temple, indicating a shift towards pagan practices. This act of offering on a foreign altar signifies a compromise in faith and a move towards syncretism, which was condemned by the prophets (<a href="/isaiah/7-10.htm">Isaiah 7:10-13</a>).<p><b>poured out his drink offering</b><br>The drink offering, typically wine, was poured out as a libation accompanying other sacrifices (<a href="/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5-10</a>). It symbolized the outpouring of one's life in service to God. Ahaz's use of this offering on a non-sanctioned altar further illustrates his deviation from the covenantal worship established by God. This act can be seen as a metaphor for Ahaz's life being poured out in service to foreign gods, contrasting with the Apostle Paul's description of his life as a drink offering in service to Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>).<p><b>and splattered the blood of his peace offerings on the altar</b><br>The peace offering, or fellowship offering, was meant to symbolize reconciliation and communion with God (Leviticus 3). By splattering the blood on an altar modeled after a pagan design, Ahaz was not only violating the sanctity of the temple worship but also misrepresenting the peace and fellowship that should exist between God and His people. This act of defilement is reminiscent of the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13-14</a>, where God commands that sacrifices be made only at the place He chooses. Ahaz's actions foreshadow the eventual downfall of Judah due to idolatry and unfaithfulness, as prophesied by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/7-30.htm">Jeremiah 7:30-34</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is central to this passage.

A burnt offering speaks of total surrender to God (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>; <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). Ironically, Ahaz was surrendering&#8212;but not to the LORD. By ignoring the divinely appointed bronze altar (<a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13-14</a>) and using this foreign model, he mixed true ritual with false worship, a pattern already condemned in the history of Jeroboam&#8217;s counterfeit altars (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31-33</a>). The verse shows how zeal can be misplaced when Scripture&#8217;s clear boundaries are set aside.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his grain offering</b><p>Alongside the burnt animal, Ahaz brought the customary grain (or meal) offering (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-10</a>). This offering symbolized gratitude and recognition that daily bread comes from God (<a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14-15</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>). In God&#8217;s design it followed a sacrifice that dealt with sin, underscoring thankfulness rooted in redemption. Ahaz kept the form&#8212;flour, oil, and frankincense&#8212;but the substance was hollow because his heart clung to idols (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-22.htm">2 Chronicles 28:22-25</a>). The scene warns that religious gestures, even thankful ones, lose meaning when detached from obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>poured out his drink offering</b><p>Next, the king &#8220;poured out his drink offering.&#8221; A libation of wine, normally added to daily or festival sacrifices (<a href="/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5-10</a>; <a href="/joel/1-9.htm">Joel 1:9</a>), expressed gladness and fellowship with God (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). Paul later used the image to describe his own life being poured out in faithful service (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>). Ahaz&#8217;s libation, however, was poured on a counterfeit altar, illustrating how the right symbolism can be emptied of its joy when directed to the wrong object of worship (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>). It reminds us that celebration must be anchored in truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and splattered the blood of his peace offerings on the altar</b><p>Finally, he &#8220;splattered the blood&#8221; of peace (or fellowship) offerings&#8212;sacrifices meant for shared meals in God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1-17</a>; 7:11-21). Sprinkling blood signified cleansing and covenant (<a href="/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6-8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>). Ahaz imitated the motions, but fellowship with the LORD was broken because he rejected God&#8217;s exclusive claim on the altar (<a href="/2_kings/16-14.htm">2 Kings 16:14-16</a>). Instead of enjoying true peace, he modeled a religion that tries to secure blessing while rewriting God&#8217;s terms&#8212;an approach Jesus later exposed in <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8-9</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Verse 13 catalogs a full suite of sacrifices&#8212;burnt, grain, drink, and peace&#8212;showing Ahaz&#8217;s energetic religiosity. Yet every act took place on an altar of his own choosing, not the one God ordained. Scripture affirms that worship pleasing to the LORD is never merely about the volume of offerings but about obedience from a devoted heart. <a href="/2_kings/16-13.htm">2 Kings 16:13</a> therefore stands as a cautionary snapshot: even the most elaborate worship becomes empty when God&#8217;s clear instructions are replaced by human invention.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And he burnt his burnt offering</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--The verse describes the thank-offering of Ahaz for his late deliverance from deadly peril. From the present narrative it does not appear but that he offered it to Jehovah.
