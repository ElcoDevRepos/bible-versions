The men referred to here were likely overseers or treasurers responsible for the funds collected for temple repairs. The lack of required accounting suggests a high level of trust in their character. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where individuals are entrusted with resources and responsibilities. In the broader biblical narrative, trustworthiness is a valued trait, as seen in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<p><b>who received the money to pay the workmen,</b><br>The funds were collected for the specific purpose of repairing the temple, which had fallen into disrepair. This task was significant, as the temple was not only a place of worship but also a symbol of God's presence among His people. The workmen were likely skilled laborers, possibly including carpenters and masons, who were essential for the restoration work. This reflects the biblical theme of using one's skills and resources for the service of God, as seen in the construction of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-11</a>).<p><b>because they acted with integrity.</b><br>Integrity is a key biblical virtue, often associated with righteousness and faithfulness. The men&#8217;s integrity ensured that the funds were used appropriately, highlighting the importance of honesty in financial dealings. This mirrors the character of God, who is described as faithful and true (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>). The emphasis on integrity also connects to the New Testament teachings on honesty and transparency, such as in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-21.htm">2 Corinthians 8:21</a>, which speaks of doing what is right in the eyes of both the Lord and man.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_joash.htm">King Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated the repair of the temple.
