The act of saddling a donkey indicates preparation and urgency. This woman, the Shunammite, is taking decisive action, reflecting her determination and faith. Her initiative is reminiscent of other biblical figures who took immediate action in times of crisis, such as Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>.<p><b>and told her servant</b><br>The presence of a servant highlights the social status of the Shunammite woman, indicating she was of some means. Servants were often entrusted with important tasks, and her command shows her authority and the trust she placed in her servant. This mirrors the relationship between other biblical figures and their servants, such as Eliezer with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/24.htm">Genesis 24</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Drive onward;</b><br>The phrase suggests urgency and determination. The Shunammite woman is focused on reaching the prophet Elisha without delay. This urgency is similar to the haste seen in other biblical narratives, such as the Israelites' exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>).<p><b>do not slow the pace for me</b><br>Her insistence on maintaining speed underscores the critical nature of her mission. It reflects her resolve and the seriousness of her situation, akin to the urgency seen in the New Testament when Jesus sets His face toward Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>).<p><b>unless I tell you.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates her control over the journey and her awareness of her own limits. It shows wisdom and foresight, ensuring that the journey is as swift as possible while still allowing for necessary adjustments. This balance of urgency and prudence is a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/21-5.htm">Proverbs 21:5</a>, which speaks to the value of diligent planning.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shunammite_woman.htm">The Shunammite Woman</a></b><br>A notable woman from Shunem who showed great faith and hospitality.
