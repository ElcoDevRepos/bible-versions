The act of setting the food before them demonstrates obedience and faith in the prophetic word. This mirrors the actions of Jesus in the New Testament, particularly in the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19</a>), where He also instructed His disciples to distribute food to the crowd. The act of setting food before others is a recurring biblical theme symbolizing provision and hospitality.<p><b>and they ate</b><br>The people eating signifies the fulfillment of God's promise through Elisha. In the context of a famine, as described earlier in <a href="/2_kings/4.htm">2 Kings 4</a>, this act of eating is not just a physical necessity but a divine provision. It reflects God's care for His people, reminiscent of the manna provided in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-15.htm">Exodus 16:15</a>). Eating together also signifies community and fellowship, a central aspect of Israelite culture and religious practice.<p><b>and had some left over</b><br>The abundance of food, with leftovers remaining, highlights the miraculous nature of God's provision. This abundance is a sign of divine blessing and parallels the miracles of Jesus, where after feeding the multitudes, there were baskets of leftovers (<a href="/john/6-12.htm">John 6:12-13</a>). It underscores the theme that God's provision is not only sufficient but overflowing, a testament to His generosity and power.<p><b>according to the word of the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and reliability of God's word. The miracle occurred precisely as Elisha had prophesied, demonstrating that God's promises are trustworthy and will come to pass. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that God's word is infallible and sovereign (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). It also reinforces the role of prophets as God's messengers, whose words carry divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah.

Bahr denies any miraculous increase of the food. He makes the miracle consist in the fact that the one hundred men were satisfied with the little they received, and even had some to spare. Similarly, Thenius thinks that the provisions were not inconsiderable for a hundred men (?), and that the emphasis of the narrative lies rather on Elisha's absolute confidence in God than on His wonder-working powers; but this is certainly opposed to the sacred writer's intention. Keil rightly calls attention to the fact that Elisha does not <span class= "ital">perform</span>, but only <span class= "ital">predicts</span>, this miracle.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the Lord.</span> We are not expressly told how the miracle was wrought, whether by an augmentation of the quantity of the food supernaturally produced, or by a lessening of the appetites of the men, as Bahr supposes. But the analogy of our Lord's miracles of feeding the multitudes, whereof this is a manifest type, makes it probable that in this case also there was a miraculous increase of the food. The object of the writer in communicating the account is certainly not merely to show how the Lord cared for his servants, but to relate another miracle wrought by Elisha, of a different kind from those previously related. He is occupied with Elisha's miracles through this entire chanter and through the three next. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/4-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So he set [it]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1447;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
