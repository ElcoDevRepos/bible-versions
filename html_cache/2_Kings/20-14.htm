His involvement with Hezekiah is well-documented, particularly in the context of Assyrian threats and Hezekiah's illness. Isaiah's approach to Hezekiah here is direct, reflecting the prophet's role as a messenger of God, often bringing both guidance and rebuke. This interaction underscores the close relationship between prophets and kings in ancient Israel, where prophets served as God's mouthpiece to the rulers.<p><b>&#8220;Where did those men come from, and what did they say to you?&#8221;</b><br>Isaiah's question is probing and discerning, indicating his awareness of the potential implications of foreign envoys visiting the king. The inquiry suggests a concern for the political and spiritual ramifications of Hezekiah's interactions. In the ancient Near East, alliances and communications with foreign powers were fraught with danger, often leading to idolatry or reliance on human strength rather than God. This question sets the stage for a deeper revelation of Hezekiah's actions and their consequences.<p><b>&#8220;They came from a distant land,&#8221; Hezekiah replied,</b><br>Hezekiah's response highlights the geographical and political significance of Babylon. At this time, Babylon was rising in power, though not yet the dominant empire it would become. The mention of a "distant land" emphasizes the far-reaching influence and ambition of Babylon, foreshadowing its future role in the exile of Judah. This interaction is a pivotal moment, revealing Hezekiah's openness to foreign influence and the potential for misplaced trust.<p><b>&#8220;from Babylon.&#8221;</b><br>Babylon, known for its grandeur and later as the captor of Judah, represents both a literal and symbolic threat. Historically, Babylon was a center of culture and power, and its mention here is prophetic, hinting at the future Babylonian captivity. This encounter with Babylonian envoys is a critical moment, as it reflects Hezekiah's failure to fully grasp the spiritual and political dangers of aligning with foreign powers. The reference to Babylon also connects to the broader biblical narrative of exile and restoration, themes central to the prophetic literature and the history of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah served as a messenger of God, delivering His words and warnings to the people of Judah and their leaders, including King Hezekiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_hezekiah.htm">King Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah known for his faithfulness to God, his reforms to restore proper worship, and his reliance on God during times of crisis.

God again dispatches His prophet to speak truth into the king&#8217;s life, confirming that &#8220;Surely the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets&#8221; (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This scene underscores spiritual accountability: even kings answer to God&#8217;s word (see <a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7-9</a> when Nathan confronted David).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and asked, &#8220;Where did those men come from, and what did they say to you?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Isaiah&#8217;s twin questions are diagnostic, not because he lacks information&#8212;<a href="/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a> notes that God left Hezekiah &#8220;to test him and to know what was in his heart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses probing questions to expose motives (<a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>; <a href="/luke/24-19.htm">Luke 24:19</a>). Isaiah invites confession, giving Hezekiah a chance to acknowledge any pride or misplaced trust.<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s order is significant:<p>&#8211; &#8220;Where&#8230;from?&#8221; surfaces the source of influence entering Judah.<p>&#8211; &#8220;What did they say&#8230;?&#8221; presses for the substance of the alliance conversation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;They came from a distant land,&#8221; Hezekiah replied</b><p>&#8226; The king answers only the first half of Isaiah&#8217;s inquiry.

Pride often downplays compromising details (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; His brief response hints at self-defense: &#8220;distant land&#8221; sounds innocuous, but God sees through every veneer (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;from Babylon.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Naming Babylon triggers a prophetic alarm.

Trust in God alone, not in foreign applause, safeguards the people of God (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Isaiah&#8217;s brief exchange with Hezekiah unmasks the king&#8217;s pride and foreshadows Judah&#8217;s captivity. God uses His prophet to confront misplaced trust, reminding every believer that even small compromises&#8212;welcoming flattery, boasting in possessions, downplaying sin&#8212;set the stage for greater loss. The passage calls us to transparent honesty before the Lord, humble dependence on His protection, and confidence that His word will unfailingly come to pass.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">What said these men?</span>--"Isaiah, with that fearless assumption of a superior position which we have noticed in Isaiah 7, at once challenges the king to explain his conduct.
