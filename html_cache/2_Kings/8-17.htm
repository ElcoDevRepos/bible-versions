His ascension to the throne at the age of thirty-two marks a significant transition in the Davidic line. This age suggests a level of maturity and experience, as he likely served alongside his father before taking full control. The age of thirty-two is notable in biblical numerology, often associated with leadership and authority. Jehoram's reign is marked by a departure from the godly ways of his father, aligning more closely with the practices of the northern kingdom of Israel, particularly through his marriage to Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel. This alliance with the house of Ahab brought idolatry and moral decline into Judah, fulfilling the warnings given by prophets about the dangers of such unions (<a href="/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25-26</a>).<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, holds immense historical and spiritual significance as the city of David and the location of the Temple. Jehoram's reign in Jerusalem is a reminder of the covenant promises God made to David regarding his descendants and the enduring nature of his throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). However, Jehoram's reign is characterized by turmoil and spiritual decline, contrasting with the intended role of Jerusalem as a center of worship and righteousness. His rule in this sacred city underscores the tension between God's promises and human failure, highlighting the need for a righteous king, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who would reign in justice and peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<p><b>eight years</b><br>Jehoram's eight-year reign is relatively short compared to other kings of Judah, reflecting the instability and challenges of his rule. This period was marked by internal strife, including the murder of his brothers to secure his throne (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4</a>), and external threats, such as invasions by the Philistines and Arabians (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16-17</a>). The brevity of his reign can be seen as a divine judgment for his idolatry and wickedness, as prophesied by Elijah (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-12.htm">2 Chronicles 21:12-15</a>). The number eight in biblical symbolism often represents new beginnings or a new order, yet in Jehoram's case, it signifies the end of a period of relative peace and the beginning of greater troubles for Judah, setting the stage for future reforms under his successors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram.htm">Jehoram (also known as Joram)</a></b><br>The son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.
