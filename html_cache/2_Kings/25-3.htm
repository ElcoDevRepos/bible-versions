The fourth month is Tammuz in the Hebrew calendar, corresponding to June-July. The ninth day of Tammuz marks a significant point in the siege, as it was when the city&#8217;s defenses were critically weakened. This date is historically significant as it marks the beginning of the end for Jerusalem, leading to its eventual fall and destruction. The precision of the date underscores the chronicler's intent to highlight the severity and historical importance of the event.<p><b>the famine in the city was so severe</b><br>The siege of Jerusalem led to a devastating famine, a common consequence of prolonged sieges in the ancient world. The Babylonians cut off supplies, leading to extreme scarcity of food. This famine fulfills the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/14-15.htm">Jeremiah 14:15-18</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16-17</a>), who foretold the dire consequences of the people's disobedience to God. The severity of the famine is a reflection of the judgment that had been prophesied due to the nation's persistent idolatry and rebellion against God.<p><b>that the people of the land had no food</b><br>The phrase highlights the desperation and suffering of the inhabitants of Jerusalem. The "people of the land" refers to the general population, including those who were not part of the ruling class. This situation is reminiscent of previous famines in Israel's history, such as during the time of Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a>), and serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God. The lack of food symbolizes the spiritual famine that had also taken hold of the nation, as they had rejected the sustenance of God's word. This dire situation foreshadows the ultimate destruction of the city and the temple, leading to the Babylonian exile, a pivotal moment in Israel's history that would shape their identity and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, under siege by the Babylonians, leading to severe famine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonians.htm">Babylonians</a></b><br>The empire led by King Nebuchadnezzar, besieging Jerusalem as a judgment from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, whose reign ended with the fall of Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>A severe lack of food resulting from the prolonged siege, symbolizing God's judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ninth_day_of_the_fourth_month.htm">The Ninth Day of the Fourth Month</a></b><br>A specific time marker indicating the depth of the crisis during the siege.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The famine in Jerusalem was a direct result of the people's disobedience to God.

As I have elsewhere observed, "The intensity of the suffering endured may be gathered from Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Josephus. The complexions of the men grew black with famine (<a href="/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>; <a href="/lamentations/5-10.htm">Lamentations 5:10</a>); their skin was shrunk and parched (<a href="/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>); the rich and noble women searched the dunghills for setups of offal (<a href="/lamentations/4-5.htm">Lamentations 4:5</a>); the children perished for want, or were even devoured by their parents (<a href="/lamentations/2-20.htm">Lamentations 2:20</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3, 4, 10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10</a>); water was scarce, as well as food, and was sold at a price (<a href="/lamentations/5-4.htm">Lamentations 5:4</a>); third part of the inhabitants died of the famine, and the plague which grew out of it (<a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>)" (see the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. it. p. 147). <span class="cmt_word">And there was no bread for the people of the land.</span> Bread commonly fails comparatively early in a siege. It was some time before the fall of the city that Ebed-Meleeh expressed his fear that Jeremiah would starve, since there was no more bread in the place (see <a href="/jeremiah/38-9.htm">Jeremiah 38:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/25-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">By the ninth [day]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7791;i&#353;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
