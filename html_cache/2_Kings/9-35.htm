Jezebel, the wife of King Ahab, was a notorious queen known for promoting Baal worship in Israel and persecuting the prophets of Yahweh. Her death was prophesied by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>), and Jehu, anointed as king, was the instrument of her demise. The act of going out to bury her indicates a customary respect for the dead, even for someone as reviled as Jezebel, reflecting the cultural norms of burial practices in ancient Israel.<p><b>they found nothing but her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands</b><br>This gruesome discovery fulfills Elijah's prophecy that dogs would devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel (<a href="/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>). The specific mention of the skull, feet, and palms suggests a divine judgment, leaving only the parts of her body that symbolize her thoughts, actions, and deeds. The dogs consuming her body can be seen as a sign of ultimate disgrace and divine retribution, as dogs were considered unclean animals.

Dogs in Oriental countries are ever prowling about, especially in the vicinity of towns, on the lookout for food, and will eat flesh or offal of any kind. They have been called "the scavengers of the East," and the phrase well describes them.
