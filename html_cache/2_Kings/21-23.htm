His reign was marked by idolatry and evil practices, similar to those of his father. The term "servants" refers to his officials or those who served in his court. This reflects the political instability and internal strife within the kingdom of Judah during this period. The discontent among his servants suggests a lack of loyalty and possibly a reaction to his policies or personal behavior.<p><b>conspired against him</b><br>Conspiracy in the ancient Near East was not uncommon, especially in monarchies where power struggles were frequent. This phrase indicates a secret plan or plot by Amon's own officials to overthrow him. Such conspiracies often arose from dissatisfaction with a ruler's decisions or character. In the biblical context, conspiracies against kings are seen in other instances, such as the assassination of King Joash (<a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>). This reflects the broader theme of divine judgment and the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>and killed the king</b><br>The act of killing a king was a serious and treasonous act, often leading to significant political upheaval. In the biblical narrative, the death of a king often signifies divine judgment or the fulfillment of prophecy. Amon's assassination can be seen as a direct consequence of his evil reign, as described earlier in the chapter. The violent end of his rule serves as a warning against idolatry and unfaithfulness to God.<p><b>in his palace</b><br>The palace was the center of royal power and authority, making it a significant location for Amon's assassination. This setting underscores the betrayal by those closest to him, as the palace was supposed to be a place of security and protection for the king. The palace's mention highlights the gravity of the conspiracy and the breach of trust within the royal court. The palace's archaeological remains in Jerusalem provide insights into the grandeur and political significance of such structures during the period.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amon.htm">Amon</a></b><br>Amon was the king of Judah, the son of Manasseh, and father of Josiah.
