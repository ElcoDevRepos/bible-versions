Shunem was a town in the territory of Issachar, located in the Jezreel Valley. This area was fertile and strategically important, often mentioned in the context of various biblical events. Shunem is also known from the story of the Shunammite woman in <a href="/1_samuel/28-4.htm">1 Samuel 28:4</a>, where the Philistines camped before the battle of Gilboa. Elisha's journey to Shunem signifies his active ministry and the spread of God's word throughout Israel.<p><b>and a prominent woman who lived there</b><br>The woman is described as "prominent," indicating her wealth, influence, or social standing. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, women of prominence often had significant roles in their households and communities. Her prominence may also suggest her ability to provide for Elisha, reflecting the biblical theme of hospitality. This woman is later identified as the Shunammite woman, who plays a significant role in Elisha's ministry, demonstrating faith and hospitality.<p><b>persuaded him to have a meal</b><br>Hospitality was a crucial aspect of ancient Near Eastern culture, and sharing a meal was a sign of friendship and respect. The woman's persuasion indicates her eagerness to serve the man of God, reflecting the biblical principle of showing kindness to strangers, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>. Her hospitality foreshadows the blessings she will receive, illustrating the principle that those who bless God's servants are themselves blessed.<p><b>So whenever he would pass by, he would stop there to eat</b><br>Elisha's repeated visits to the woman's home suggest a relationship of mutual respect and trust. This regular hospitality provided Elisha with physical sustenance and a place of rest, enabling him to continue his prophetic ministry. The woman's consistent generosity is reminiscent of the widow of Zarephath's support for Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/17-8.htm">1 Kings 17:8-16</a>, highlighting the theme of God's provision through faithful individuals. This relationship also prefigures the New Testament practice of supporting itinerant ministers, as seen in 3 <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5-8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God, successor to Elijah, known for performing miracles and being a spiritual leader in Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shunem.htm">Shunem</a></b><br>A town in the territory of Issachar, located in the northern part of ancient Israel.

And they said, No; but we will abide in the street all night.">Genesis 19:2</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-37.</span> - 2. <span class="accented">The promise of a child to the Shunammite woman</span>, <span class="accented">and the restoration of the child to life</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it fall on a day, that.</span> The expression seems to be archaic. It occurs only here and in the opening chapters of the Book of Job (Job 1:6, 13; 2:1). The most literal rendering would be, <span class="accented">and the day came when</span>. Elisha passed to Shunem. Shunem was a village of Galilee, situated in the territory assigned to Issachar (<a href="/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>). It is reasonably identified with the modern <span class="accented">Solam</span>, at the south-eastern foot of the Gebel Duhy, or "Little Hermon," a "flourishing village encompassed by gardens" (Porter), and "in the midst of the finest corn-fields in the world" (Grove), on the edge of the Plain of Esdraelon. Elisha, in his progression to different parts of the northern kingdom, happened to come on one occasion to Shunem. <span class="cmt_word">Where was a great woman.</span> Houbigant strangely translates, "a tan woman," maintaining that a woman would not be called "great" in the sense of "wealthy" during her husband's lifetime; but no other commentator has accepted his view. The meaning seems to be that she was a woman of substance, one well-to-do, perhaps one that had brought her husband the bulk of his wealth. <span class="cmt_word">And she constrained him to eat bread</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she invited him in as he passed her house, and would take no denial. Compare Lot's pressing hospitality, as related in <a href="/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1-3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</span> Elisha, it appears, had frequent occasion to pass through Shunem on his way from Carmel to visit the cities of Galilee, or <span class="accented">versa</span>. It became his habit, on these journeys, to eat his meals at the house of the rich Shunammite. Hence arose a kindly feeling on both sides and a close intimacy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1436;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
