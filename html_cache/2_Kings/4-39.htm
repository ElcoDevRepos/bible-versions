The sons of the prophets, a group of disciples under Elisha, were likely in need of sustenance. Gathering herbs suggests a reliance on the land for food, reflecting the agrarian lifestyle of ancient Israel. This act of gathering also echoes the provision of God in the wilderness, where manna was collected daily.<p><b>and he found a wild vine</b><br>The wild vine represents the unknown and potentially dangerous elements in the natural world. In biblical symbolism, vines often represent Israel or spiritual fruitfulness, but a "wild" vine suggests something outside of God's cultivated provision. This can be seen as a metaphor for false teachings or influences that appear beneficial but are ultimately harmful.<p><b>from which he gathered as many wild gourds as his garment could hold</b><br>The act of gathering wild gourds in abundance shows a lack of discernment, driven by desperation. The use of the garment as a container highlights the resourcefulness and urgency of the situation. Wild gourds, likely colocynths, are known to be bitter and potentially toxic, symbolizing the dangers of relying on human understanding rather than divine guidance.<p><b>Then he came back and cut them up into the pot of stew</b><br>This action demonstrates the communal living and shared resources among the sons of the prophets. The pot of stew represents the collective sustenance of the community. The cutting and adding of the gourds without knowledge of their nature suggests a lack of spiritual discernment, paralleling the need for spiritual leaders to be vigilant against false doctrines.<p><b>though no one knew what they were</b><br>This phrase underscores the ignorance and potential peril of the situation. It serves as a warning about the consequences of spiritual blindness and the importance of seeking God's wisdom. The lack of knowledge about the gourds can be seen as a type of the hidden dangers of sin or false teachings that can infiltrate a community. This incident foreshadows the miraculous intervention of God through Elisha, pointing to Christ as the ultimate source of wisdom and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah and performed many miracles, demonstrating God's power and provision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_the_prophets.htm">The Sons of the Prophets</a></b><br>A group of prophets or disciples who were under the tutelage of Elisha, often seen as a community of believers seeking to learn and grow in their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_field.htm">The Field</a></b><br>Represents the world or environment where resources are gathered, but also where dangers and unknowns exist.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wild_vine.htm">The Wild Vine</a></b><br>Symbolizes the unknown or potentially harmful influences that can be inadvertently introduced into our lives or communities.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pot_of_stew.htm">The Pot of Stew</a></b><br>A communal meal that signifies shared resources and the importance of discernment in what we consume spiritually and physically.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_gathering.htm">Discernment in Gathering</a></b><br>Just as the man gathered unknown gourds, we must exercise discernment in what we allow into our lives, ensuring it aligns with God's truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The incident highlights the importance of community vigilance and shared responsibility in maintaining spiritual health.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_protection.htm">God's Provision and Protection</a></b><br>Despite the potential danger, God provides a solution through Elisha, reminding us of His constant care and provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_ignorance.htm">The Danger of Ignorance</a></b><br>Ignorance of what we consume, whether physically or spiritually, can lead to harm.

Awake and sing, you that dwell in dust: for your dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.">Isaiah 26:19</a>.) The Targum renders "greens." The LXX. retains the Hebrew word; the Syriac and Arabic render "mallows." Thenius thinks that <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>, the reading of the LXX., points to another word derived from a different root, and meaning "to pluck," so that the word would denote <span class= "ital">legumina</span>.<p><span class= "bld">A wild vine.</span>--Vulg., "quasi vitem silvestrem," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, a running plant, like a vine.<p><span class= "bld">Wild gourds.</span>--In <a href="/1_kings/6-18.htm" title="And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.">1Kings 6:18</a> a related word is used to describe one of the decorations of the Temple ("knops").<p>Wild gourds, or cucumbers (<span class= "ital">cucumeres agrestes</span>, or <span class= "ital">asinini</span>), are oval in shape, and taste bitter. Their Hebrew name (<span class= "ital">paqq-'oth</span>) is expressive of the fact that when ripe they are apt to <span class= "ital">burst</span> upon being touched. If eaten they act as a violent purgative. They were mistaken on the present occasion for edible gourds, a favourite food of the people (<a href="/numbers/11-5.htm" title="We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:">Numbers 11:5</a>). The Vulg. renders "colocynth," or coloquintida, a plant of the same family, bearing large orange-like fruits, which are very bitter, and cause colic (<span class= "ital">cucumis colocynthi, L</span>.). Keil supposes this to be the "wild vine" intended.<p><span class= "bld">They knew them not.</span>--And so did not stop the young man from his shredding.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And one went out into the field to gather herbs.</span> One of the sons of the prophets, probably, went out into the neighboring country, and looked about for any wild fruits or vegetables that he could see anywhere. <span class="cmt_word">And found a wild vine.</span> Not a wild grape vine (<span class="accented">Vitis labrusea</span>), the fruit of which would have been harmless, but some cucurbitaceous plant, with tendrils, and a growth like that of the vine. <span class="cmt_word">And gathered thereof wild gourds.</span> The exact kind of gourd is uncertain. Recent critics have mostly come to the conclusion that the vegetable intended is the <span class="accented">Cucumis agrestis</span> or <span class="accented">Ecbalium elaterium</span>, the "squirting cucumber" of English naturalists. This is a kind of gourd, the fruit of which is egg-shaped, has a bitter taste, and bursts when ripe at a slight touch, squirting out sap and seeds. The main ground for this conclusion is etymologieal, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> being derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e7;&#x5e2;</span>, "to crack" or "split." Another theory, and one which has the ancient versions in its favor, identifies the "gourd" in question with the fruit of the colocynth, which is a gourd-like plant that creeps along the ground, and has a round yellow fruit of the size of a large orange. This fruit is exceedingly bitter, produces colic, and affects the nerves<span class="cmt_word">.
