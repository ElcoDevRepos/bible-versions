His illness occurred during a time of political and military tension, as the Assyrian Empire was a looming threat. The phrase "in those days" refers to a period after Hezekiah's significant religious reforms and the miraculous deliverance of Jerusalem from the Assyrians. The nature of his illness is not specified, but it was severe enough to be considered life-threatening. This event is also recorded in <a href="/isaiah/38.htm">Isaiah 38</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/32.htm">2 Chronicles 32</a>, highlighting its importance in Hezekiah's life and reign.<p><b>The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him and said,</b><br>Isaiah was a major prophet in Judah, serving during the reigns of several kings, including Hezekiah. His role as a prophet was to convey God's messages to the people and their leaders. Isaiah's involvement underscores the seriousness of Hezekiah's condition, as prophets were often sent by God to deliver messages of significant consequence. Isaiah's relationship with Hezekiah was one of mutual respect, and he played a crucial role in advising the king during times of crisis.<p><b>&#8220;This is what the LORD says:</b><br>The phrase indicates the divine authority behind Isaiah's message. Prophets often prefaced their messages with this phrase to emphasize that they were speaking on behalf of God, not from their own authority. It underscores the belief that God is actively involved in the affairs of His people and communicates His will through chosen messengers.<p><b>&#8216;Put your house in order,</b><br>This directive implies that Hezekiah should prepare for his impending death by settling his affairs, both personal and political. In ancient Near Eastern culture, this would involve ensuring a smooth succession, addressing any unresolved issues, and making peace with God and others. The instruction reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and responsibility, emphasizing the importance of being prepared for the end of life.<p><b>for you are about to die;</b><br>The message is clear and direct, leaving no room for ambiguity. It serves as a reminder of the mortality that all humans face, regardless of their status or achievements. In the context of Hezekiah's reign, his death would have significant implications for the kingdom of Judah, especially given the external threats from Assyria.<p><b>you will not recover.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This statement underscores the finality of God's message through Isaiah. It suggests that, without divine intervention, Hezekiah's illness would lead to his death. However, the subsequent narrative reveals that Hezekiah's fervent prayer and repentance lead to God granting him an additional fifteen years of life. This outcome highlights themes of divine mercy, the power of prayer, and the possibility of God's will being influenced by human intercession.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and reforms to restore proper worship in the kingdom.

The verse therefore invites earnest petition without denying divine foreknowledge (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>).<p>&#8226; It exposes the difference between prognosis and God&#8217;s ultimate decision; medicine declares impossibility, but the Lord holds final authority (<a href="/luke/18-27.htm">Luke 18:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/20-1.htm">2 Kings 20:1</a> announces a life-ending crisis for Hezekiah, delivered with full prophetic authority.

That Hezekiah recovered <span class= "ital">before</span> the catastrophe recorded at the end of the last chapter, is evident from the fact that no allusion to the destruction of his enemies is contained in his hymn of thanksgiving (<a href="/context/isaiah/38-10.htm" title="I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.">Isaiah 38:10-20</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Set thine house in order.</span>--The margin is right (Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/17-23.htm" title="And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and got him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.">2Samuel 17:23</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In those days.</span> This is a very vague note of time, and cannot be regarded as determining the position of the events here related with respect to the preceding narrative. Ver. 6, however, shows that a time anterior to Sennacherib's discomfiture is intended; and the same verse also fixes the date to Hezekiah's fourteenth year, which was <span class="date">B.C. 713</span>. If the date in <a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a> be regarded as genuine, we must consider that the illness happened in the year of Sennacherib's first expedition against Palestine; but if we regard that date as interpolated, and accept the Assyrian inscriptions as our chronological authorities, we must place the events of the present chapter twelve years earlier than that expedition, in the reign of Sargon over Assyria, and in the first reign of Merodach-Baladan over Babylon. It belongs, at any rate, to the middle part of Hezekiah's reign, while his treasures were intact (vers. 13-17), and had not been carried off to Nineveh. <span class="cmt_word">Was Hezekiah sick unto death</span>; stricken, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by a malady which, in the ordinary course of nature, would have been fatal. <span class="cmt_word">And the Prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him.</span> The designation of Isaiah as "the prophet," and" the son of Amoz," as if previously unknown to the reader, indicates the original independency of the narrative, which the writer of Kings probably obtained from a separate source. <span class="cmt_word">And said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.</span> The statement was a warning, not a prophecy. It is parallel to that of Jonah to the Ninevites, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/20-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In those</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;h&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
