The context is the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah. The Assyrians, led by King Sennacherib, were a dominant military power, known for their brutal conquests. This statement underscores God's sovereignty over nations and kings, a recurring theme in the Bible (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/40-23.htm">Isaiah 40:23</a>). It also reflects the prophetic tradition where God communicates His will through prophets, in this case, Isaiah.<p><b>&#8216;He will not enter this city</b><br>This assurance from God directly counters the threat posed by the Assyrian army. Jerusalem, the city in question, holds significant religious and political importance as the capital of Judah and the location of the Temple. Historically, cities under siege often fell to powerful empires like Assyria, but God's promise here highlights His protection over Jerusalem. This echoes other instances where God defends His people, such as in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, where God fights for Israel against the Egyptians.<p><b>or shoot an arrow into it.</b><br>The imagery of an arrow signifies warfare and aggression. In ancient warfare, arrows were among the first weapons used in an assault, often signaling the beginning of an attack. God's promise that not even an arrow will be shot underscores the totality of His protection. This phrase can be seen as a testament to God's ability to prevent even the smallest act of aggression against His chosen city, reflecting His omnipotence and care.<p><b>He will not come before it with a shield</b><br>The shield represents the defensive preparations of an army ready to engage in battle. In ancient times, soldiers would advance with shields to protect themselves from enemy projectiles. The assurance that the Assyrian king will not come with a shield indicates that there will be no need for such preparations, as the battle will not occur. This highlights God's intervention in human affairs, preventing conflict before it begins, similar to how He intervened in the battle against the Midianites in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>.<p><b>or build up a siege ramp against it.</b><br>Siege ramps were crucial in ancient warfare, allowing armies to breach city walls. The construction of a siege ramp was a significant military undertaking, often leading to the fall of a city. God's promise that no siege ramp will be built signifies that Jerusalem will not face the typical fate of besieged cities. This divine protection is reminiscent of God's deliverance of Israel in other dire situations, such as the miraculous fall of Jericho's walls in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who provides spiritual protection and victory over sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Isaiah to deliver a message of assurance and protection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_assyria.htm">King of Assyria</a></b><br>Refers to Sennacherib, the Assyrian king who threatened Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, under threat from the Assyrian army but promised divine protection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_isaiah.htm">Prophet Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message of deliverance to King Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_hezekiah.htm">King Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who seeks God's intervention against the Assyrian threat.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and their leaders.

The authority is unmistakable&#8212;no counsel or military strategy can override the decree of the Sovereign LORD (cf. <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24&#8211;27</a>). Earlier in the chapter, Isaiah had already delivered God&#8217;s word: &#8220;Do not be afraid of the words you have heard&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/19-6.htm">2 Kings 19:6</a>). Now the Lord zeros in on Sennacherib, king of the Assyrian empire, assuring Hezekiah that the threat will be neutralized at its source.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will not enter this city</b><p>Jerusalem&#8217;s gates will remain unbreached. God promises literal, physical protection&#8212;Assyria will not even step inside. In <a href="/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a> we hear the same confidence: &#8220;God is within her; she will not be moved.&#8221; What looked like certain doom (<a href="/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17&#8211;19</a>:13) is reversed by divine intervention, and verse 34 underscores why: &#8220;For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for the sake of My servant David&#8221;. God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness overrides Assyria&#8217;s military prowess.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor shoot an arrow into it</b><p>Not a single projectile will fly over Jerusalem&#8217;s walls. The promise is total. In <a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>, Moses declared, &#8220;The Egyptians you see today, you will never see again,&#8221; and here God makes a similarly sweeping guarantee. Isaiah&#8217;s parallel account repeats the wording verbatim (<a href="/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33</a>), doubling down on its certainty. Humanly speaking, arrows were inevitable; divinely speaking, they were impossible.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will not come before it with a shield</b><p>Assyrian soldiers often approached fortified cities under large shields that sheltered them from defending archers, yet God forbids even that first step. Sennacherib&#8217;s army had bragged, &#8220;With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/37-25.htm">Isaiah 37:25</a>), but their shields will never darken Jerusalem&#8217;s horizon. <a href="/2_chronicles/32-7.htm">2 Chronicles 32:7&#8211;8</a> echoes Isaiah&#8217;s message: &#8220;With him is merely an arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor build up a siege ramp against it</b><p>A siege ramp signaled a long, grinding assault. God cancels the blueprint before it&#8217;s drafted. Earlier, Assyria had successfully built ramps against Lachish (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-9.htm">2 Chronicles 32:9</a>), but the same engineering feats will not touch Zion. Jesus later warned Jerusalem of future siege works (<a href="/luke/19-43.htm">Luke 19:43</a>), proving this promise was specific to Sennacherib&#8217;s campaign, not a blanket exemption for all time. On this occasion, the Lord puts an unscalable wall around His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every phrase in <a href="/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32</a> layers a fresh guarantee: no entry, no arrows, no shields, no ramps. God shuts down every tactic in the Assyrian playbook, demonstrating His absolute sovereignty and covenant love. The angel of the LORD will strike 185,000 Assyrian troops that very night (19:35), validating the promise word for word. When God speaks, His people can rest; the most formidable threats are powerless before His decree.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32-34) This may be, as Mr. Cheyne supposes, an after <span class= "ital">addition</span> to the original prophecy.
