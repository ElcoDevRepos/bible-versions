His father, Hezekiah, was a righteous king who enacted significant religious reforms, but Manasseh's reign marked a dramatic shift back to idolatry and pagan practices. The age of twelve indicates that he likely relied heavily on advisors, who may have influenced his early decisions. This young age for a king is not unprecedented in the Bible, as seen with Joash, who became king at seven (<a href="/2_kings/11-21.htm">2 Kings 11:21</a>).<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years</b><br>Manasseh's fifty-five-year reign is the longest of any king in Judah or Israel, indicating a period of relative political stability despite his religious apostasy. This long reign allowed for the entrenchment of idolatrous practices, which had lasting negative effects on Judah. His reign is often seen as a time of moral and spiritual decline, setting the stage for future judgment. The length of his reign is significant in biblical history, as it contrasts with the short reigns of many other kings, highlighting the patience and long-suffering nature of God despite Manasseh's evil actions.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Hephzibah</b><br>The mention of Hephzibah, Manasseh's mother, provides a personal detail that may indicate her influence or status. The name Hephzibah means "My delight is in her," which is also used in <a href="/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a> as a symbolic name for Jerusalem, suggesting a connection to the city's destiny. While little is known about her, the inclusion of her name may imply her importance in the royal court or her potential role in Manasseh's upbringing. The naming of mothers in the accounts of kings often highlights their significance in the narrative, whether for their positive or negative influence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The son of Hezekiah, Manasseh became king of Judah at a young age.

The sharp contrast between father and son reminds us that every generation must choose obedience for itself (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; His name, tied to Joseph&#8217;s firstborn (<a href="/genesis/41-51.htm">Genesis 41:51</a>), points to God&#8217;s faithfulness to the tribes, even when individuals rebel.<p>&#8226; Though Manasseh will lead Judah into deep idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/21-2.htm">2 Kings 21:2&#8211;9</a>), God&#8217;s Word records his story to warn and instruct (<a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The historical record in 2 Chron 33 shows that even such a king could find mercy when he humbled himself, highlighting the boundless grace of God (<a href="/psalms/86-5.htm">Psalm 86:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was twelve years old when he became king</b><p>&#8220;was twelve years old when he became king&#8221;<p>&#8226; A twelve-year-old on the throne underscores the literal, historical detail of Scripture.
