Bethel was a major center of idolatry in the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The altar at Bethel was established by Jeroboam I as a rival worship site to Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-29</a>). This act of pulling down the altar demonstrates a return to the worship of Yahweh and a rejection of syncretism and idolatry.<p><b>the high place set up by Jeroboam son of Nebat</b><br>Jeroboam son of Nebat was the first king of the Northern Kingdom after the division of Israel. He established high places at Bethel and Dan to prevent his subjects from going to Jerusalem to worship (<a href="/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-30</a>). These high places were centers of idol worship and were condemned by the prophets (<a href="/1_kings/13.htm">1 Kings 13:1-3</a>).<p><b>who had caused Israel to sin</b><br>Jeroboam's establishment of these high places led Israel into sin by promoting idolatry. This phrase highlights the spiritual decline initiated by Jeroboam, which had long-lasting effects on the nation. The sin of Jeroboam became a recurring theme in the evaluation of subsequent kings of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/15-34.htm">1 Kings 15:34</a>).<p><b>Then he burned the high place</b><br>Burning the high place was a symbolic act of purification and destruction of idolatry. It was a common practice to destroy objects associated with false worship to prevent their reuse (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>). This act signifies a complete eradication of the idolatrous practices that had taken root in Israel.<p><b>ground it to powder</b><br>Grinding the high place to powder indicates a thorough and irreversible destruction. This mirrors Moses' destruction of the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-20.htm">Exodus 32:20</a>) and signifies the total rejection of idolatry. It emphasizes the seriousness of the reform and the commitment to eradicate sin.<p><b>and burned the Asherah pole</b><br>The Asherah pole was a wooden symbol associated with the Canaanite goddess Asherah, often placed near altars of Baal. Burning the Asherah pole was a direct attack on the Canaanite religious practices that had infiltrated Israelite worship.
