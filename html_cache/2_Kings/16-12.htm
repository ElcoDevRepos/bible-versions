This journey signifies a political alliance and submission to Assyria, which was a dominant power at the time. Damascus was the capital of Aram, a region that had been conquered by Assyria. Ahaz's visit indicates his reliance on foreign powers rather than trusting in God, contrasting with the faithfulness expected of a king of Judah.<p><b>and saw the altar</b><br>Ahaz saw an altar in Damascus that impressed him, leading him to replicate it in Jerusalem. This altar was likely associated with Assyrian or Aramean religious practices, which were contrary to the worship of Yahweh as prescribed in the Mosaic Law. The introduction of a foreign altar into the temple precincts represents a significant departure from the religious traditions of Israel, highlighting Ahaz's syncretism and disregard for the covenantal laws.<p><b>he approached it</b><br>Ahaz's approach to the altar signifies his personal involvement and endorsement of this new form of worship. This act symbolizes a shift in religious practices and priorities, as the king himself leads the nation in adopting foreign rituals. It reflects a broader theme in the Old Testament of leaders influencing the spiritual direction of the people, often leading them away from true worship.<p><b>and presented offerings on it</b><br>By presenting offerings on the altar, Ahaz actively participates in a form of worship that is not sanctioned by God. This act of offering sacrifices on a foreign altar is a direct violation of the commands given to Israel regarding worship and sacrifices, which were to be conducted at the altar in the temple as prescribed by God. This action can be seen as a type of idolatry, drawing parallels to other instances in Scripture where leaders led the people into false worship, such as Jeroboam's golden calves (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>).

While there he admired Assyria&#8217;s grandeur and, most significantly, its altar. Returning &#8220;from Damascus,&#8221; he carried the memory&#8212;and a sketch&#8212;of that pagan structure. His homecoming is not just a travel note; it exposes a heart that had wandered. Instead of seeking guidance from the LORD as David did in <a href="/2_samuel/5-19.htm">2 Samuel 5:19</a>, Ahaz depended on foreign alliances (compare <a href="/2_chronicles/28-16.htm">2 Chronicles 28:16-21</a>) and foreign worship. The text highlights how quickly compromise abroad becomes compromise at home.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and saw the altar</b><p>Uriah the priest had already finished the replica (<a href="/2_kings/16-11.htm">2 Kings 16:11</a>). When Ahaz &#8220;saw&#8221; it, several things were happening:<p>&#8226; He was visually approving what God had never commanded (contrast <a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>, where the bronze altar&#8217;s design came directly from God).<p>&#8226; He was placing a man-made copy above the divinely ordained original, ignoring <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-6</a>, which insists worship occur at the place God chooses.<p>&#8226; He was signaling to the nation that Assyrian syncretism was now acceptable, foreshadowing the later charge in <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a> that Judah &#8220;built the high places of Baal &#8230; which I did not command.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he approached it</b><p>The king&#8217;s movement toward the altar is deliberate. In <a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a> God restricts altar service to Aaron&#8217;s descendants, yet Ahaz steps right in. His behavior echoes Saul&#8217;s unlawful sacrifice in <a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8-13</a> and Uzziah&#8217;s temple intrusion in <a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-20</a>&#8212;both warnings against leaders who blur the line between civil and priestly roles. By &#8220;approaching,&#8221; Ahaz declares, &#8220;I will decide how worship is done,&#8221; rejecting God&#8217;s clear boundaries.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and presented offerings on it</b><p>Verse 13 details the acts that follow: &#8220;He offered his burnt offering and grain offering, poured out his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar&#8221;. Every element mimics legitimate Levitical sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>; 2:1-2; 3:1-2) yet takes place on a counterfeit platform. The blend of correct ritual with a corrupt setting intensifies the offense (see <a href="/deuteronomy/12-30.htm">Deuteronomy 12:30-31</a>). Instead of leading Judah in covenant faithfulness, Ahaz leads them into deeper idolatry, a path that, according to <a href="/2_chronicles/28-22.htm">2 Chronicles 28:22-23</a>, only multiplies their troubles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/16-12.htm">2 Kings 16:12</a> captures the decisive moment when King Ahaz trades God&#8217;s pattern for an Assyrian one. His return from Damascus sets the stage; seeing the foreign altar stirs desire; approaching it reveals presumption; offering on it completes the rebellion. The verse warns that borrowed worship, no matter how impressive, dethrones God&#8217;s revealed will. True worship respects the place, the pattern, and the Person God Himself has ordained.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">The king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.</span>--So the Targum renders. But all the other versions: "The king approached to the altar, <span class= "ital">and went up</span> thereon." (Comp. <a href="/context/1_kings/12-32.htm" title="And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like to the feast that is in Judah, and he offered on the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.">1Kings 12:32-33</a>.) It thus appears that Ahaz, like Uzziah, personally exercised the priestly function of sacrifice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.</span> It is not necessarily implied in these words that Ahaz, like Uzziah, usurped the priestly functions, though conceivably he may have done so, and Urijah may have stood tamely by. What the writer has it in his mind to record is that the king, on his return from Damascus, at once made use of the new' altar for his private sacrifices. If he had meant to tax Ahaz with so great a sin as that which brought the curse of leprosy upon Uzziah, he would almost certainly have made his meaning clearer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/16-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1433;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
