In biblical terms, a "tender heart" signifies humility and openness to divine instruction. This is reminiscent of the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>, where Jesus blesses the meek and those who are poor in spirit. A tender heart is contrasted with a hardened heart, which is often associated with rebellion and disobedience in Scripture, such as Pharaoh's heart in Exodus.<p><b>and you humbled yourself before the LORD</b><br>Humility before God is a recurring theme throughout the Bible. It is a recognition of God's sovereignty and one's own limitations. This act of humbling oneself is seen in other biblical figures like Moses and David, who acknowledged their dependence on God. <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a> encourages believers to humble themselves before the Lord, promising that He will lift them up.<p><b>when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its people</b><br>This refers to the prophetic words of judgment pronounced against Judah and Jerusalem due to their idolatry and disobedience. The historical context is the reign of King Josiah, who discovered the Book of the Law and realized the nation's sins. The phrase underscores the importance of responding to God's warnings, as seen in the prophetic ministries of Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>that they would become a desolation and a curse</b><br>The language of desolation and curse is common in the Old Testament, often used to describe the consequences of breaking the covenant with God. <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> outlines blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience, which include becoming a desolation. This prophecy was fulfilled with the Babylonian exile, a pivotal event in Jewish history.<p><b>and because you have torn your clothes and wept before Me</b><br>Tearing one's clothes and weeping were traditional expressions of grief, repentance, and humility in ancient Israel. This act signifies genuine sorrow for sin and a desire for reconciliation with God. Similar expressions of repentance are seen in the story of Nineveh in <a href="/jonah/3.htm">Jonah 3</a>, where the people fasted and wore sackcloth.<p><b>I have heard you,&#8217; declares the LORD</b><br>God's response to Josiah's repentance is a testament to His mercy and willingness to forgive. This assurance of being heard by God is echoed in 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, which promises forgiveness and cleansing from sin for those who confess. It also reflects the relational nature of God, who listens to the cries of His people, as seen in the Psalms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who initiated religious reforms and sought to restore the worship of Yahweh.

Confronted with the nation&#8217;s long-ignored covenant obligations, he tore his robes in grief. Huldah the prophetess then delivered God&#8217;s word, including the line we are studying (<a href="/2_kings/22-15.htm">2 Kings 22:15-20</a>). The surrounding chapters show God ready to pour out the same judgments foretold in <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> and earlier announced because of Manasseh&#8217;s wickedness (<a href="/2_kings/21-10.htm">2 Kings 21:10-15</a>).

Josiah did not rationalize or delay; he trembled at what he heard (<a href="/isaiah/66-5.htm">Isaiah 66:5</a>).<p>&#8226; God repeatedly favors such sensitivity&#8212;seen earlier in David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>) and later commended in the church (<a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And You Humbled Yourself Before the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Humility is the reflex of a tender heart. Josiah lowered himself under divine authority (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>).<p>&#8226; He did not appeal to royal privilege or national history; he acknowledged guilt and need (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture portrays humility as the doorway to grace. Where pride resists, humility invites God&#8217;s mercy (<a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When You Heard What I Spoke Against This Place</b><p>&#8226; Josiah responded at the moment of hearing, not after disaster struck (<a href="/hebrews/3-15.htm">Hebrews 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;This place&#8221; refers to Jerusalem and the temple, now under threat of becoming &#8220;like Samaria&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/21-13.htm">2 Kings 21:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Hearing God&#8217;s warnings is designed to provoke immediate repentance (<a href="/ezekiel/33-10.htm">Ezekiel 33:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That They Would Become a Desolation and a Curse</b><p>&#8226; The terms echo covenant sanctions&#8212;desolation (<a href="/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31-33</a>) and curse (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness includes judgment as well as blessing (<a href="/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>). Josiah grasped that certainty and let it break him.<p>&#8226; The threat was national, yet an individual king&#8217;s response still mattered, illustrating personal accountability within corporate judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because You Have Torn Your Clothes and Wept Before Me</b><p>&#8226; Tearing clothes signified deep sorrow (<a href="/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a>; <a href="/esther/4-1.htm">Esther 4:1</a>). Josiah&#8217;s outward act matched inward anguish (<a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; His tears were not for lost comfort but for offended holiness&#8212;paralleling Peter&#8217;s weeping (<a href="/luke/22-62.htm">Luke 22:62</a>) and Paul&#8217;s sorrow over sin (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-9.htm">2 Corinthians 7:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Authentic repentance engages both heart and action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I Have Heard You, Declares the LORD</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s hearing is covenantal: He listens to the contrite (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Verse 20 affirms the result&#8212;Josiah would die in peace, spared from witnessing the exile (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-27.htm">2 Chronicles 34:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; This showcases divine responsiveness: judgment delayed because one man humbled himself (<a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>). It underscores prayer&#8217;s effectiveness when aligned with repentance (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/22-19.htm">2 Kings 22:19</a> reveals a timeless principle: God notices and responds to a tender, humble, repentant heart. Josiah&#8217;s quick submission to Scripture, visible grief over sin, and earnest appeal moved the LORD to postpone judgment. The verse teaches that no matter how severe the announced consequences, genuine contrition invites divine mercy. God&#8217;s character remains consistent&#8212;He opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble&#8212;and His ear is always open to those who tremble at His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Tender.</span>--See <a href="/1_chronicles/29-1.htm" title="Furthermore David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.">1Chronicles 29:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/13-7.htm" title="And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.">1Chronicles 13:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/20-8.htm" title="And the officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return to his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart.">Deuteronomy 20:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Hast humbled thyself.</span>--Comp. the behaviour of Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.">1Kings 21:27</a> <span class= "ital">seq</span>.).<p><span class= "bld">Become a desolation and a curse.</span>--See <a href="/jeremiah/44-22.htm" title="So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.">Jeremiah 44:22</a>.
