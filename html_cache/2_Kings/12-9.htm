The verse underscores transparent stewardship, accountability, and the integral link between worship and generous giving. God honors both leaders who establish righteous systems and worshipers who respond with obedient, heartfelt offerings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">But.</span>--<span class= "ital">And</span>.<p><span class= "bld">Jehoiada the priest took a chest.</span>--By order of the king (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-8.htm" title="And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 24:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the Lord.</span>--Chronicles says: "in the gate of the house of the Lord outwards." This can hardly refer to the same position. It probably describes where the chest, which became a permanent feature of the sanctuary, stood in the time after the return from the Captivity. The chronicler adds that offerings were asked by proclamation throughout the country, and that the princes and people readily contributed.<p><span class= "bld">Put.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">used to put</span>. The chest was kept locked, and the Levitical doorkeepers received the money from those who offered it, and dropped it at once into the chest.

The chest was placed outside the sanctuary (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-8.htm">2 Chronicles 24:8</a>), and, indeed, outside the porch, on the right hand as one entered into the court by the north door. It was thus very conspicuous. <span class="cmt_word">And the priests that kept the door</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the door of the court - <span class="cmt_word">put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the Lord.</span> The priests received the money from those who offered, at the gate of the court, and, proceeding to the chest, dropped it in through the aperture. A man could not see that all which he had given was put in, but he reckoned on the good faith of the priest, and was satisfied. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/12-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Jehoiada</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1444;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3077.htm">Strong's 3077: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehoiada -- 'the LORD knows', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
