His insistence on giving a gift reflects the cultural norm of offering a reward for services rendered, especially for miraculous healing. A talent was a significant amount of money, indicating Naaman's wealth and gratitude. This act also highlights the contrast between Naaman's generosity and Gehazi's greed, which is later revealed.<p><b>And he urged Gehazi to accept them.</b><br>Gehazi, Elisha's servant, initially refused the gift on behalf of Elisha, who had declined any reward to demonstrate that God's grace cannot be bought. Naaman's urging shows his earnest desire to express gratitude, but it also sets the stage for Gehazi's moral failure. This moment foreshadows Gehazi's succumbing to temptation, which is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating the human struggle with sin.<p><b>Then he tied up two talents of silver in two bags along with two sets of clothing</b><br>The act of tying up the silver and clothing signifies preparation and intention. Clothing in ancient times was a valuable commodity, often used as a form of wealth. The two sets of clothing may symbolize Naaman's respect and acknowledgment of Gehazi's service. This detail also emphasizes the substantial nature of the gift, which Gehazi later deceitfully acquires.<p><b>and gave them to two of his servants, who carried them ahead of Gehazi.</b><br>Naaman's servants carrying the gifts ahead of Gehazi indicates the importance and weight of the offering. It also reflects the hierarchical social structure of the time, where servants played a crucial role in executing the will of their masters. This action foreshadows Gehazi's deceitful plan to take the gifts for himself, contrasting with the integrity expected of a servant of a prophet.

His persistence shows:<p>&#8226; A transformed heart that now longs to bless Israel&#8217;s God-appointed servants (cf. <a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Recognition that &#8220;the laborer is worthy of his wages&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>), even though Elisha had chosen to decline reward to keep God&#8217;s grace unmistakably free (<a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>Naaman&#8217;s insistence exposes the tension between genuine generosity and the danger of greed lying in wait for Gehazi (compare <a href="/acts/8-18.htm">Acts 8:18&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Please, take two talents.&#8221;</b><p>A talent of silver weighed roughly 75 pounds; two talents represent an extraordinary sum. Naaman&#8217;s &#8220;please&#8221; underscores humility; he is no longer the proud commander of verse 11 but a grateful servant. Similar doubled language of generosity appears in <a href="/genesis/43-12.htm">Genesis 43:12</a> (&#8220;Take double the money&#8221;) and <a href="/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a> (&#8220;A generous soul will prosper&#8221;).

The verse foreshadows the destructive power of covetousness (<a href="/joshua/7-21.htm">Joshua 7:21</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then he tied up two talents of silver in two bags</b><p>The careful packaging emphasizes both the value and the legitimacy of the gift; Naaman treats the offering with dignity (cf. <a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>&#8212;gifts opened and presented). Tangible preparation also removes any excuse for Gehazi to refuse, pressing the test of his character (<a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Along with two sets of clothing</b><p>In ancient culture garments were wealth and status symbols (<a href="/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>; <a href="/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12</a>). New clothes for Gehazi could signify honor, but they will instead cloak deceit (contrast <a href="/zechariah/3-4.htm">Zechariah 3:4</a> where clean garments symbolize righteousness). Jesus later warns, &#8220;Life does not consist in an abundance of possessions&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gave them to two of his servants</b><p>Naaman delegates the heavy load&#8212;an act of thoughtful courtesy and efficiency (compare <a href="/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>; <a href="/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a>). It also provides witnesses, underscoring Naaman&#8217;s transparency versus Gehazi&#8217;s impending secrecy (<a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who carried them ahead of Gehazi</b><p>The servants go &#8220;ahead,&#8221; placing Gehazi in a position of following rather than leading&#8212;an ironic picture of a servant of God being led by worldly treasure (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>). The procession underscores how sin often travels in plain sight before the fall is exposed (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/5-23.htm">2 Kings 5:23</a> shows Naaman&#8217;s sincere, even lavish gratitude meeting Gehazi&#8217;s developing greed.
