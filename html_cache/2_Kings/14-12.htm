Historically, this event occurs during the reign of Amaziah, king of Judah, and Jehoash, king of Israel. The conflict between these two kingdoms reflects the ongoing division and tension following the split of the united monarchy after Solomon's reign. The term "routed" suggests a complete and overwhelming defeat, emphasizing the power imbalance in this particular battle. This defeat can be seen as a consequence of Amaziah's pride and failure to heed prophetic warnings, as seen earlier in the chapter. The division between Israel and Judah serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God's covenant, which initially led to the split of the kingdom.<p><b>and every man fled to his home</b><br>This phrase highlights the totality of the defeat, as the soldiers of Judah did not regroup or attempt a counterattack but instead fled individually to their homes. This reflects a breakdown in military discipline and morale, often seen in ancient warfare when an army is decisively beaten. The scattering of the troops signifies a lack of unity and leadership, which can be contrasted with the ideal of a united Israel under a godly king. The imagery of each man fleeing to his home also underscores the personal impact of the defeat, affecting not just the nation but individual families and communities. This event foreshadows the eventual downfall of both kingdoms due to their continued disobedience and internal strife, as prophesied in various parts of the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
