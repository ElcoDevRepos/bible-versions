The Arameans, also known as Syrians, had besieged Samaria, leading to severe famine. The sudden departure of the Arameans, caused by divine intervention, left their camp abandoned and full of supplies. This event demonstrates God's power to deliver His people and fulfill His promises, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6-7</a>, where the Lord caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses, prompting their flight.<p><b>It was then that a seah of fine flour sold for a shekel,</b><br>A seah is a unit of measure for dry goods, approximately 7.3 liters or 1.9 gallons. The sale of fine flour at this price indicates a dramatic reversal of the famine conditions. Previously, food was so scarce that a donkey's head and dove's dung were sold at exorbitant prices (<a href="/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a>). The shekel, a standard unit of currency, suggests a return to normalcy and economic stability. This fulfillment of Elisha's prophecy (<a href="/2_kings/7.htm">2 Kings 7:1</a>) underscores the reliability of God's word.<p><b>and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel,</b><br>Barley, often considered a less desirable grain than wheat, was a staple food for the poor. The availability of barley at this price further illustrates the abundance that followed the lifting of the siege. The economic turnaround highlights God's provision and the miraculous nature of the event, as the city moved from extreme scarcity to surplus overnight.<p><b>according to the word of the LORD.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin and authority of the prophecy given by Elisha. The fulfillment of the prophecy serves as a testament to God's sovereignty and faithfulness. Throughout Scripture, God's word is shown to be powerful and true, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where it is stated that God's word will not return void but will accomplish His purposes. This event also prefigures the ultimate provision and deliverance found in Jesus Christ, who fulfills God's promises and provides spiritual sustenance to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_samaria.htm">The People of Samaria</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the city who were suffering from a severe famine due to the Aramean siege.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_arameans.htm">The Arameans</a></b><br>The enemy army that besieged Samaria, causing the famine, but fled after hearing the sound of a great army, leaving their camp abandoned.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>The prophet of God who foretold the end of the famine and the abundance of food.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp_of_the_arameans.htm">The Camp of the Arameans</a></b><br>The location where the Arameans had set up their siege, which was later plundered by the people of Samaria.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_the_lord.htm">The Word of the LORD</a></b><br>The prophecy given by Elisha that the famine would end and food would be plentiful.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_word.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Word</a></b><br>The fulfillment of Elisha's prophecy demonstrates that God is faithful to His promises.
