His actions fulfilled the prophecy given to Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16-17</a>) and later confirmed by Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6-10</a>). Jehu's reign marked a significant turning point in Israel's history, as he was an instrument of divine judgment against idolatry and apostasy. His acts included the destruction of Ahab's family and the execution of Jezebel, which were pivotal in purging Israel of Baal worship.<p><b>along with all his accomplishments</b><br>Jehu's accomplishments were not limited to his military conquests and purges. He also established a dynasty that lasted for four generations, as promised by God (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>). His political maneuvers and alliances, such as paying tribute to Shalmaneser III of Assyria, helped secure his reign and maintain relative stability in Israel during a turbulent period. Jehu's reign is a testament to the complex interplay of divine sovereignty and human agency in biblical history.<p><b>and all his might</b><br>Jehu's might is evident in his decisive and often ruthless actions. His military prowess and strategic acumen were crucial in his rise to power and the consolidation of his kingdom. The biblical narrative highlights his determination and strength, which were instrumental in executing God's judgment. However, his might also serves as a cautionary tale about the potential for human power to be wielded without regard for God's ultimate purposes, as Jehu failed to fully turn Israel back to the worship of Yahweh (<a href="/2_kings/10-31.htm">2 Kings 10:31</a>).<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</b><br>This phrase indicates that the detailed records of Jehu's reign were documented in an official annal, the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. This book, now lost, was a historical source that chronicled the reigns of the kings of Israel, similar to the annals of other ancient Near Eastern cultures. The mention of this book underscores the historical reliability of the biblical narrative and reflects the common practice of recording royal achievements and events. It also highlights the importance of written records in preserving the history and lessons of God's dealings with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was anointed by God to destroy the house of Ahab and eradicate Baal worship from Israel.
