In the context of <a href="/2_kings/4.htm">2 Kings 4</a>, Elisha is a prophet in Israel during the 9th century BC, a time when the nation was divided into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. The widow's obedience to Elisha's instructions demonstrates her faith in God's provision through His prophet. This act of leaving to follow divine instruction is reminiscent of other biblical figures who acted in faith, such as Abraham leaving his homeland (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>).<p><b>and after she had shut the door behind her and her sons</b><br>Shutting the door signifies privacy and a focus on the task at hand, free from distractions or interruptions. This act of closing the door is similar to Jesus' instruction in <a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a> about praying in private, emphasizing a personal and intimate encounter with God. The presence of her sons highlights the family unit's involvement in the miracle, teaching them about faith and reliance on God.<p><b>they kept bringing jars to her</b><br>The act of bringing jars is a direct response to Elisha's earlier command to gather as many vessels as possible (<a href="/2_kings/4-3.htm">2 Kings 4:3</a>). This reflects the principle of preparation and expectation for God's provision. The jars symbolize the capacity to receive God's blessings, and the number of jars collected would directly impact the extent of the miracle. This mirrors the principle found in <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>, where the measure given is the measure received.<p><b>and she kept pouring</b><br>The continuous pouring of oil represents the miraculous provision of God, reminiscent of the manna provided to the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 16). The oil, a valuable commodity in ancient Israel used for cooking, lighting, and anointing, symbolizes the Holy Spirit and God's abundant grace. This miracle foreshadows the New Testament account of Jesus multiplying the loaves and fishes (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>), demonstrating God's power to provide beyond natural limitations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_widow.htm">The Widow</a></b><br>A woman whose husband, a prophet, had died, leaving her in debt.
