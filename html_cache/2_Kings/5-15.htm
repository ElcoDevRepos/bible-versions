This return to Elisha signifies a transformation in Naaman's understanding and belief. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a military leader like Naaman would have been accompanied by a retinue, indicating his high status. His return to Elisha, the "man of God," shows humility and gratitude, as well as a recognition of the true source of his healing.<p><b>stood before him</b><br>Standing before Elisha symbolizes respect and acknowledgment of Elisha's authority as a prophet. In biblical times, standing before someone was a posture of submission and readiness to listen or serve. This act also reflects Naaman's acknowledgment of the power of the God of Israel, as represented by His prophet.<p><b>and declared, &#8220;Now I know for sure that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel.</b><br>Naaman's declaration is a profound confession of faith, especially coming from a Gentile. It highlights the exclusivity of the God of Israel, contrasting with the polytheistic beliefs prevalent in Aram and other surrounding nations. This statement echoes the monotheistic theme found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." Naaman's acknowledgment serves as a foreshadowing of the inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan of salvation, a theme further developed in the New Testament.<p><b>So please accept a gift from your servant.&#8221;</b><br>Offering a gift was a customary way to show gratitude and honor in the ancient Near East. Naaman's use of "your servant" indicates his humility and recognition of Elisha's higher spiritual authority. However, Elisha's refusal to accept the gift (as seen in the following verses) underscores the principle that God's grace and miracles cannot be bought or repaid, emphasizing the free and sovereign nature of divine grace. This act prefigures the New Testament teaching of salvation as a free gift from God, not earned by human effort or wealth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naaman.htm">Naaman</a></b><br>A commander of the army of the king of Aram, who was healed of leprosy after following the prophet Elisha's instructions to wash in the Jordan River.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>The prophet of God in Israel who instructed Naaman on how to be healed, demonstrating God's power and grace.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>The river in which Naaman was instructed to wash seven times to be cleansed of his leprosy, symbolizing obedience and faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram (Syria)</a></b><br>The nation from which Naaman came, often in conflict with Israel, highlighting the reach of God's power beyond Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_attendants.htm">The Attendants</a></b><br>Naaman's servants who accompanied him, witnessing the miracle and Naaman's transformation in faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_god's_sovereignty.htm">Recognition of God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Naaman's declaration acknowledges the supremacy of the God of Israel, reminding us to recognize God's sovereignty in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_obedience.htm">Faith and Obedience</a></b><br>Naaman's healing came through obedience to God's word through Elisha, teaching us the importance of faith and following God's instructions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_grace_extends_to_all.htm">God's Grace Extends to All</a></b><br>Naaman, a foreigner, experienced God's grace, illustrating that God's love and power are available to all who seek Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_encounter.htm">Transformation Through Encounter</a></b><br>Naaman's encounter with God led to a transformation in belief and action, encouraging us to seek personal encounters with God for transformation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_and_generosity.htm">Gratitude and Generosity</a></b><br>Naaman's offer of a gift reflects a heart of gratitude, prompting us to respond to God's blessings with thankfulness and generosity.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_5_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 5:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Naaman_s_story_redefine_true_worship.htm">How does Naaman's acknowledgment of God challenge our understanding of true worship today?

The powerlessness of the Syrian gods and the potency of Jehovah having been brought home to his mind by his marvellous recovery, he concludes that there is no god anywhere save in the land of Israel. In other words, his local conception of deity still clings to him. What a mark of historic truth appears in this representation!<p><span class= "bld">Now therefore</span>.--And now.<p><span class= "bld">Take a blessing of.--</span><span class= "ital">Accept a present from</span> (<a href="/genesis/33-11.htm" title="Take, I pray you, my blessing that is brought to you; because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.

It involved going out of his way at least fifty miles. At the Jordan, Naaman was on his way home, had accomplished a fourth part of his return journey; in three more days he would be in Damascus, in his own palace. But he feels that it would be an unworthy act to accept his cure and make no acknowledgment of it, having turned away from the prophet "in a rage" (ver. 12), now, without apology, or retraction, or expression of regret or gratitude, to return into his own country under the obligation of an inestimable benefit. His cure has wrought in him, not merely a revulsion of feeling from rage and fury to thankfulness, but a change of belief. It has convinced him that the God of Elisha is the God of the whole earth. It has turned him from a worshipper of Rimmon into a worshipper of Jehovah. He must proclaim this. He must let the prophet know what is in his heart. He must, if possible, induce him to accept a recompense. Therefore he thinks nothing of an outlay of time and trouble, but retraces his steps to the Israelite capital, taking with him all his company, his horses and his chariots, his gold and silver and bales of clothing, and numerous train of attendants. <span class="cmt_word">And came, and stood before him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> descended from his chariot, and asked admittance into the prophet's house, and was received and allowed an audience - a striking contrast with his previous appearance before the house, in expectation that the prophet would come down and wait upon him. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel.</span> This is an acknowledgment of the sole supremacy of Jehovah on the part of a heathen, such as we scarcely find elsewhere. The general belief of the time, and indeed of antiquity, was that every land had its own god, who was supreme in it - Baal in Phoenicia, Che-mesh in Moab, Moloch in Ammon, Rimmon in Syria, Bel or Bel-Merodach in Babylon, Amun-Ra in Egypt, etc.; and when there is an acknowledgment of Jehovah on the part of heathens in Scripture, it is almost always the recognition of him as a god - the God of the Jews or of the Israelites, one among many (see <a href="/exodus/10-16.htm">Exodus 10:16, 17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-26.htm">2 Kings 17:26</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33-35</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/2-11.htm">2 Chronicles 2:11</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>; <a href="/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a>, etc.). But here we have a plain and distinct recognition of him as the one and only God that is in all the earth. Naaman thus shows a greater docility, a readier receptivity, than almost any of the other pious heathens who are brought before us in Scripture. Balaam and Cyrus alone equal him. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a present" - <span class="cmt_word">of thy servant.</span> Heathens were accustomed to carry presents to the oracles which they consulted, and to reward those from which they received favorable responses with gifts of enormous value (see Herod., 1:14, 50, etc.). The Jewish prophets did net generally object to such free-will offerings. Naaman therefore quite naturally and reasonably made the offer. He would have contravened usage had he not done so. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/5-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Naaman</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
