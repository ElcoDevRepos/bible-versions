These groups were likely organized communities dedicated to studying and proclaiming God's word. Jericho, a city with a rich biblical history, was a strategic location near the Jordan River, where significant events often took place. The sons of the prophets were witnesses to the miraculous event of Elijah being taken up to heaven, which affirmed the divine authority and continuity of prophetic leadership.<p><b>they said, &#8220;The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration acknowledges the transfer of prophetic authority and power from Elijah to Elisha. The "spirit of Elijah" signifies the same divine empowerment and prophetic mantle that Elijah carried. This transfer is reminiscent of Moses passing his leadership to Joshua, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/34-9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>, where Joshua is filled with the spirit of wisdom. The continuity of God's work through chosen leaders is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing God's faithfulness in maintaining His covenant and guidance for His people.<p><b>And they went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him.</b><br>The act of bowing down signifies respect and recognition of Elisha's new role as the leading prophet. This gesture is not one of worship, which is reserved for God alone, but rather an acknowledgment of Elisha's authority and the divine calling upon his life. In the cultural context of the time, bowing was a common way to show honor and submission to someone in a position of authority. This moment marks the beginning of Elisha's ministry, which would be characterized by numerous miracles and a strong prophetic voice, continuing the work of Elijah and pointing forward to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate prophet, priest, and king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A major prophet in Israel known for his powerful ministry and miraculous acts.

The transfer shows God&#8217;s work is never dependent on one person&#8212;He raises new servants for each generation (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; This pattern foreshadows John the Baptist coming &#8220;in the spirit and power of Elijah&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>), underscoring the continuity of God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they went to meet him</b><p>&#8226; Their movement toward Elisha signals acceptance of his new role.

They honored the office and the God who empowered it.<p>&#8226; Such humility prepares hearts to hear God&#8217;s word (<a href="/james/1-21.htm">James 1:21</a>). By bowing, the prophetic community showed they would submit to the authority of God&#8217;s message through Elisha.<p>&#8226; Their reverence affirms a biblical principle: honoring God-appointed leaders invites blessing and order (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/2-15.htm">2 Kings 2:15</a> records a pivotal moment: eyewitnesses to Elijah&#8217;s departure publicly recognize that God&#8217;s empowering Spirit now rests on Elisha. Their acknowledgment, movement toward him, and respectful bow together confirm the seamless transfer of prophetic authority. The passage assures us that when one servant&#8217;s race is finished, God faithfully equips the next, preserving His word and advancing His purposes from generation to generation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">To view.</span>--<span class= "ital">Opposite, over against.</span> LXX., <span class= "greekheb">?? ????????</span>; Vulg., "e contra" (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-52.htm" title="Yet you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go thither to the land which I give the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 32:52</a>).

Probably they had seen the passage of the Jordan by the two prophets, the disappearance of Elijah, and the return of Elisha across the stream in a way which they may have suspected to be miraculous. But the Jordan is four or five miles distant from the city of Jericho, and their apprehension of the various circumstances would be incomplete, and more or less vague.
