This reflects the cultural importance of hospitality in ancient Israel, where providing for travelers and guests was a significant duty. The "upstairs" indicates a separate, private space, likely on the roof, which was common in ancient Near Eastern architecture. This act of kindness is reminiscent of the hospitality shown to prophets and men of God throughout the Bible, such as the widow of Zarephath's care for Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9-24</a>).<p><b>and put in it a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp for him.</b><br>The provision of basic furnishings&#8212;bed, table, chair, and lamp&#8212;demonstrates thoughtful care for Elisha's needs, ensuring his comfort and ability to study or write. Each item has symbolic significance: the bed for rest, the table for sustenance or study, the chair for sitting, and the lamp for light, representing spiritual illumination. This mirrors the provision of God for His servants, ensuring they have what is necessary to fulfill their mission. The lamp, in particular, can be seen as a symbol of God's Word, as in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."<p><b>Then when he comes to us, he can stay there.</b><br>The Shunammite woman's initiative ensures that Elisha has a place of refuge and rest whenever he visits. This reflects the ongoing relationship between the prophet and the family, highlighting the mutual respect and support between God's servants and His people. It also foreshadows the blessings that come from supporting God's work, as seen later in the chapter when Elisha intercedes for the woman, resulting in the miraculous birth of her son (<a href="/2_kings/4-16.htm">2 Kings 4:16-17</a>). This act of hospitality can be seen as a type of Christ's invitation to abide with Him, as He prepares a place for believers (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah.
