The "Book of the Law" is generally understood to be a portion of the Torah, likely Deuteronomy, discovered during temple renovations. This discovery is significant as it highlights the neglect of God's law in Judah prior to Josiah's reforms. The reading of the law brought awareness of the nation's deviation from God's commandments, emphasizing the importance of Scripture in guiding the moral and spiritual life of the people. This event parallels the rediscovery of God's Word in personal and communal life, leading to repentance and revival.<p><b>he tore his clothes</b><br>Tearing one's clothes in ancient Israel was a customary expression of deep grief, distress, or repentance. Josiah's reaction indicates his profound sorrow and alarm upon realizing the extent of Judah's disobedience and the impending judgment prophesied in the law. This act of tearing clothes is a physical manifestation of a contrite heart, aligning with biblical themes of repentance seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>, which calls for rending hearts rather than garments.

Josiah listens to Shaphan read the rediscovered Book of the Law, and conviction strikes him. Until that reading, the king ruled with sincerity but without the full light of God&#8217;s explicit commands. Hearing exposes forgotten truth&#8212;just as <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a> notes that &#8220;faith comes by hearing.&#8221; Likewise, in <a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a> the crowd is &#8220;pierced to the heart&#8221; after hearing Peter&#8217;s sermon; revelation always calls for response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the words of the Book of the Law</b><p>These are not mere historical records; they are the covenant terms God spoke through Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-24.htm">Deuteronomy 31:24-26</a>). For Josiah, they function like a mirror (<a href="/james/1-23.htm">James 1:23-25</a>), reflecting the nation&#8217;s sin and his duty as king. <a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-11</a> celebrates this same Law as &#8220;perfect, reviving the soul,&#8221; and <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a> reminds us it &#8220;judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&#8221; Confronted with divine standards, Josiah sees how far Judah has drifted into idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he tore his clothes</b><p>Tearing garments is an outward sign of inward grief and repentance (<a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>, <a href="/esther/4-1.htm">Esther 4:1</a>). Josiah&#8217;s reaction testifies that true leadership humbles itself under God&#8217;s authority. Compare <a href="/2_chronicles/34-19.htm">2 Chronicles 34:19</a>, which parallels this scene, and see also <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>, where even a pagan king dons sackcloth at God&#8217;s warning.

The verse challenges every believer: let Scripture confront us, break our complacency, and lead us into obedient action.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the Law, that he rent his clothes.</span> To Josiah the book was evidently, as to Hilkiah, in some sort a discovery. It was not, however, a wholly new thing; rather, he accepted it as the recovery of a thing that was known to have been lost, and was now happily found. And in accepting it he regarded it as authoritative. It was not to him "a book of Law" (Ewald), but "the book of <span class="accented">the</span> Law."
