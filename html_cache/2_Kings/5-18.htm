His request for forgiveness indicates his newfound faith in the God of Israel. The phrase highlights the tension between his duties and his faith. It reflects the struggle of maintaining faith in a polytheistic society, where allegiance to the God of Israel might conflict with civic duties. This plea for forgiveness shows Naaman's understanding of God's grace and mercy, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible.<p><b>When my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there,</b><br>Rimmon was a Syrian deity, likely associated with storms or thunder. The temple of Rimmon was a place of significant cultural and religious importance in Syria. Naaman's master, the king of Syria, would have participated in state rituals there, which were integral to maintaining political and social order. This context underscores the challenge Naaman faces as a believer in the God of Israel while serving in a pagan environment. The situation is reminiscent of other biblical figures like Daniel, who also navigated faithfulness to God while serving in foreign courts.<p><b>and he leans on my arm,</b><br>This phrase indicates Naaman's role as a close and trusted aide to the king, possibly even a ceremonial role during worship. It suggests a position of honor and responsibility, which complicates his ability to abstain from participating in pagan rituals. The physical act of leaning implies support and assistance, highlighting Naaman's dilemma of being physically present in a place of idol worship while spiritually committed to the God of Israel.<p><b>and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon,</b><br>Bowing down in the temple signifies an act of worship or reverence, which Naaman is concerned about because it could be seen as compromising his faith. This act is not voluntary but rather a part of his duty, reflecting the complex interplay between personal faith and public duty. The Bible often addresses the issue of idolatry, and Naaman's concern here is about maintaining purity of worship, a theme echoed in the Ten Commandments and throughout the prophetic writings.<p><b>may the LORD forgive your servant in this matter.&#8221;</b><br>Naaman's request for forgiveness acknowledges his understanding of God's holiness and the seriousness of idolatry. It also reflects his desire to remain faithful despite unavoidable circumstances. This plea is an early example of the concept of grace, where God's forgiveness is sought for actions that are not aligned with His will. It parallels the New Testament teachings on grace and forgiveness through Jesus Christ, who provides a way for believers to be reconciled to God despite their shortcomings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naaman.htm">Naaman</a></b><br>A commander of the army of the king of Aram, who was healed of leprosy by the prophet Elisha.

Elisha&#8217;s assurance, &#8220;Go in peace,&#8221; confirms that God honors a contrite heart determined to remain loyal even in hostile environments.

Rimmon was the god of the atmosphere, called in Accadian, AN. IM ("god of the air or wind"), figured on bas-reliefs and cylinders as armed with the thunderbolt. His name is prominent in the story of the Flood (e.g., it is said Rammanu irmum, "Rimmon thundered"); and one of his standing titles is <span class= "ital">Rahicu</span> ("he who deluges"). The Assyrians identified Ramman with the Aramean and Edomite Hadad.

On returning to Damascus, it will be among his civil duties to accompany his master to the national temples, and to prostrate himself before the images of the national deities. If he declines, if (like an early Christian) he will not enter "the house of devils," much less bow down before the graven image of a false god, it may cost him his life; it will certainly cost him his court favor. For such a sacrifice he is not prepared. Yet his conscience tells him that he will be acting wrongly. He therefore expresses a hope, or a prayer, that his fault, for a fault he feels that it will be, may be forgiven him - that Jehovah will not be "extreme to mark what is done amiss," but will excuse his outward conformity to his inward faith and zeal. That <span class="cmt_word">when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon.</span> Riminon is probably derived from <span class="accented">rum</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>), "to be high," and means "the exalted god," according to the gloss of He-sychins - <span class="greek">&#x3a1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. It is wrongly connected with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, "a pomegranate," and should rather be compared with the Arabic <span class="accented">Er Rhaman</span>, "the Most High." The royal name, "Tab-Bitumen" (<a href="/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), contains the root, as does also the local name (<a href="/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>), "Hadad-Rimmon." This last word gives rise to the suspicion that Hadad and Rimmon are merely two names of the same deity, who was called "Hadad" or "Hadar" as bright and glorious, "Rim-men" as lofty and exalted. <span class="cmt_word">To worship there, and he leaneth on my hand</span>. Either Naaman's leprosy must have been recent, and he refers to the king's practice in former times, or there must have been far less horror of leprosy among the Syrians than there was among the Hebrews.
