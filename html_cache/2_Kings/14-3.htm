In the context of the Kings of Israel and Judah, doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD often meant adhering to the covenantal laws given to Moses. This phrase is used to evaluate the moral and spiritual conduct of the king, suggesting a level of obedience and faithfulness. However, it is important to note that this assessment is relative, as the subsequent phrases will clarify. The standard for righteousness is God's law, and the king's actions are measured against this divine standard.<p><b>but not as his father David had done</b><br>David is often used as the benchmark for righteous kingship in the Old Testament. He is described as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>), and his reign is characterized by a deep commitment to God, despite his personal failings. This phrase suggests that while the king did what was right, he did not reach the level of devotion and faithfulness that David exemplified. David's reign is marked by his establishment of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel and his desire to build a temple for the LORD, which reflects his heart for God. The comparison to David highlights the king's shortcomings in spiritual leadership and personal devotion.<p><b>He did everything as his father Joash had done</b><br>Joash, also known as Jehoash, was a king of Judah who initially did what was right in the eyes of the LORD under the guidance of Jehoiada the priest (<a href="/2_kings/12-2.htm">2 Kings 12:2</a>). However, after Jehoiada's death, Joash's reign was marred by idolatry and apostasy, as he turned away from God and even sanctioned the murder of Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17-22</a>). This phrase indicates that the king followed in the footsteps of Joash, suggesting a pattern of initial obedience followed by spiritual decline. The reference to Joash serves as a warning about the dangers of failing to maintain a steadfast commitment to God and the influence of ungodly counsel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned after his father Joash.

The phrase &#8220;right in the eyes of the LORD&#8221; is the same commendation given to kings who honored God&#8217;s covenant (cf. <a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/25-2.htm">2 Chronicles 25:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Doing right means measuring conduct by God&#8217;s standards, not public opinion (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-18.htm">Deuteronomy 6:18</a>). Amaziah honored the Mosaic Law early in his rule, even executing his father&#8217;s assassins while sparing their children in line with <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a> (<a href="/2_kings/14-5.htm">2 Kings 14:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord notices and records every faithful act. Even partial obedience is acknowledged, showing His patience and grace toward imperfect leaders (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but not as his father David had done</b><p>&#8226; David remains the benchmark for wholehearted devotion (<a href="/1_kings/15-5.htm">1 Kings 15:5</a>). Saying Amaziah was &#8220;not as his father David&#8221; underlines that God evaluates rulers by inner loyalty as much as outward deeds (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s pattern included:<p>&#8211; Complete trust in God, not alliances (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>).<p>&#8211; Consistent worship centered on the ark and later the temple site (<a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>).<p>&#8211; Quick repentance when he sinned (<a href="/bsb/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>).<p>&#8226; Amaziah, by contrast, tolerated high-place worship (<a href="/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>) and later bowed to Edomite idols (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14</a>), exposing a divided heart. God desires an undivided loyalty that keeps Him at the center (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He did everything as his father Joash had done</b><p>&#8226; Joash began well under priestly guidance, repairing the temple and reinstating offerings (<a href="/2_kings/12-2.htm">2 Kings 12:2-4</a>). Amaziah followed that early model, continuing temple maintenance and regular sacrifices.<p>&#8226; Yet Joash drifted after Jehoiada&#8217;s death (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17-19</a>). Amaziah repeated the same trajectory&#8212;initial zeal, later compromise.<p>&#8226; This parallel warns that inherited faithfulness can stall without personal conviction. Each generation must pursue God for itself (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Patterns we model influence others, for good or ill (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>). Amaziah&#8217;s sons watched both his obedience and his compromises; Judah&#8217;s future kings would echo both.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Amaziah&#8217;s record in <a href="/2_kings/14-3.htm">2 Kings 14:3</a> portrays a king who started right, emulated his immediate predecessor&#8217;s reforms, yet fell short of David&#8217;s wholehearted devotion. God graciously notes his obedience while candidly exposing his limits. The verse invites readers to celebrate every step of faith while pressing on to undivided loyalty, making David&#8217;s single-minded heart&#8212;and ultimately Christ&#8217;s perfect obedience&#8212;our true standard.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Yet not like David his father.</span>--The chronicler paraphrases this reference to the ideal king of Israel: "<span class= "ital">yet not with a perfect heart.</span>"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, yet not like David his father.</span> Only one King of Judah hitherto, viz.

All the others had fallen short more or less; and Amaziah fell short in many respects. He was wanting in "a perfect heart" (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-2.htm">2 Chronicles 25:2</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a fixed intention to do God's will; he was proud and boastful (ver. 10); he gave way to idolatry in his later years (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14</a>), and he despised the reproof of the prophet who was sent to rebuke his sin (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-16.htm">2 Chronicles 25:16</a>). Though placed among the "good kings' by the authors of both Kings and Chronicles, it is, as it were, under protest, with a distinct intimation that, although better than most of his predecessors, he did not reach a high standard. <span class="cmt_word">He did according to all things as Joash his father did.</span> There is something of Oriental hyperbole in this statement, which must be understood in the spirit, not in the letter. The two kings were differently circumstanced, and history did not "repeat itself" in their reigns. The position of Joash with respect to Jehoiada finds no parallel in the circumstances of the life of Amaziah. Still, the lives are parallel to some extent. Both kings began better than they ended. Both were zealous for Jehovah at first, but turned to idolatry at last. Both opposed themselves to prophets, and treated their rebukes with scorn. Both reused conspiracy against them by their misconduct, and were murdered by the malcontents. Further, both were unsuccessful in war, had to withstand a siege of their capital, and bought off their enemy by the surrender of the greater part of its wealth, including the treasures of the temple (comp. <a href="/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18</a> with <a href="/2_kings/14-14.htm">2 Kings 14:14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/14-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
