His affirmation here indicates his recognition of Elisha as a true prophet of God, contrasting with the false prophets often consulted by the kings of Israel. This statement reflects Jehoshaphat's reliance on divine wisdom, reminiscent of his earlier alliance with Ahab where he insisted on consulting a prophet of the LORD (<a href="/1_kings/22-7.htm">1 Kings 22:7</a>). The phrase underscores the importance of seeking God's word through His appointed messengers, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</b><br>The king of Israel at this time is Jehoram, son of Ahab, who, despite his idolatrous background, seeks Elisha's counsel due to the dire situation they face against Moab. The inclusion of the king of Edom, a vassal state under Judah's influence, highlights the political alliances of the time. The phrase "went down to him" suggests a physical descent, likely from a higher elevation to where Elisha was, possibly near the wilderness of Edom. This act of going to the prophet signifies humility and recognition of the need for divine intervention. The collaboration of these three kings, despite their differing religious commitments, illustrates the unifying power of a common threat and the acknowledgment of the true God's authority, as seen in other instances where God uses unlikely alliances for His purposes (e.g., Cyrus in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

Mean</div><b>Jehoshaphat affirmed</b><p>- The godly king of Judah instantly recognizes the need for divine guidance when the coalition runs out of water in the desert (<a href="/2_kings/3-9.htm">2 Kings 3:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>- His history shows the same impulse: &#8220;Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here?&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/22-7.htm">1 Kings 22:7</a>) and &#8220;Have faith in the LORD your God and you will be upheld&#8221; (2 Chron 20:20).<p>- He refuses to move without God&#8217;s counsel, reminding us that wise leadership prizes revelation over military strength (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The word of the LORD is with him.&#8221;</b><p>- Jehoshaphat identifies Elisha as a true spokesman because God&#8217;s Word consistently accompanies him (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19</a>; <a href="/1_kings/17-24.htm">1 Kings 17:24</a>).<p>- A genuine prophet&#8217;s authority rests not in personality but in proven fidelity to the LORD&#8217;s message (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>- By confessing this, Jehoshaphat publicly affirms that Scripture&#8217;s testimony&#8212;and not political power&#8212;defines truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the king of Israel</b><p>- Jehoram, though idolatrous (<a href="/2_kings/3-2.htm">2 Kings 3:2&#8211;3</a>), is desperate enough to seek God&#8217;s prophet.<p>- His presence shows that even reluctant hearts must turn to the LORD when human resources fail (<a href="/psalms/107-27.htm">Psalm 107:27&#8211;28</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s mercy extends to flawed leaders who humble themselves, foreshadowing the patience later displayed toward Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Jehoshaphat</b><p>- Judah&#8217;s king models spiritual consistency by accompanying Israel&#8217;s king to Elisha (2 Chron 17:3&#8211;4).<p>- He demonstrates partnership guided by faith, not by mere politics, reflecting <a href="/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3</a>: &#8220;Can two walk together unless they have agreed to do so?&#8221;<p>- His eagerness to hear God underscores that unity among believers must be rooted in shared submission to Scripture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the king of Edom</b><p>- Edom&#8217;s ruler, likely a vassal under Israel, joins the mission, showing how God&#8217;s Word draws even distant nations into His plans (<a href="/psalms/22-27.htm">Psalm 22:27&#8211;28</a>).<p>- His inclusion fulfills earlier prophecies of Edom&#8217;s subjugation (<a href="/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>) yet also hints at the future invitation to Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>).<p>- All earthly powers ultimately find direction under the same divine authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>went down to him</b><p>- The three kings physically descend to Elisha, an act of humility mirroring Naaman&#8217;s later trip to Jordan (<a href="/2_kings/5-9.htm">2 Kings 5:9&#8211;14</a>).<p>- &#8220;Going down&#8221; signifies submitting to God&#8217;s servant and placing royal crowns beneath the higher crown of the LORD (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p>- Their readiness to receive the Word becomes the turning point for the entire campaign (<a href="/2_kings/3-16.htm">2 Kings 3:16&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>- God&#8217;s Word, proven and living, resides with His chosen messenger; wise leaders recognize and pursue it.<p>- True unity forms when all parties bow to Scripture&#8217;s authority, not when they merely share political goals.<p>- Humility&#8212;&#8220;going down&#8221;&#8212;precedes divine direction and victory.<p>- The verse invites every reader to mirror Jehoshaphat&#8217;s reflex: identify where God&#8217;s Word is spoken and run there without delay, trusting that &#8220;the word of the LORD endures forever&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm">1 Peter 1:25</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12)

It is impossible to say how Jehoshaphat had acquired this conviction. Elijah's selection of Elisha to be his special attendant (<a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19-21</a>) was no doubt generally known, and may have raised expectations that Elisha would be the next great prophet. Jehoshaphat <span class="accented">may</span> have heard of the miracles recorded in <a href="/2_kings/2.htm">2 Kings 2</a>. At any rate, he appears to have been firmly convinced of Elisha's prophetic mission, and to have accepted him as the authorized exponent of God's will at the time. <span class="cmt_word">So the King of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the King of Edom went down to him.</span> Prophets were commonly summoned into the king's presence, or, if they had a message to him, contrived a meeting in some place where they knew he would be. That the kings should seek Elisha out and visit him was a great sign both of the honor in which he was held, and also of the extent to which they were humbled by the danger which threatened them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/3-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jehoshaphat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1428;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3092.htm">Strong's 3092: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehoshaphat -- 'the LORD has judged', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">affirmed,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1433;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
