Despite numerous warnings from prophets and the clear instructions given in the Law of Moses, the people often turned away from God. This reflects a pattern seen in passages like <a href="/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>, where the Israelites repeatedly failed to heed divine guidance. The failure to listen is not just a physical act of ignoring but a spiritual rebellion against God's covenant.<p><b>and Manasseh led them astray</b><br>Manasseh, son of Hezekiah, was one of the most notorious kings of Judah, reigning for 55 years. His leadership marked a significant departure from his father's reforms, as he reintroduced idolatry and pagan practices. This phrase underscores the influence of leadership on the spiritual direction of a nation. Manasseh's actions are detailed in <a href="/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21:1-7</a>, where he is described as building altars to Baal, worshiping the host of heaven, and even sacrificing his own son. His reign is a stark reminder of the impact of ungodly leadership, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>.<p><b>so that they did greater evil than the nations</b><br>The comparison to the nations that God had previously judged and displaced for their wickedness (such as the Canaanites) is significant. It indicates that Judah's sins under Manasseh's rule were not only comparable but exceeded those of the pagan nations. This is a fulfillment of warnings given in <a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-28</a>, where God cautioned Israel against adopting the detestable practices of the nations they were to dispossess. The phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the potential for God's people to fall into deeper sin than those who do not know Him.<p><b>that the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites</b><br>This refers to the divine judgment executed upon the Canaanite nations during the conquest of the Promised Land, as recorded in the book of Joshua. The destruction of these nations was due to their abominable practices, which had reached a fullness of iniquity (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>). The mention of the LORD's past actions serves as a historical reminder of God's righteousness and justice. It also foreshadows the impending judgment that would come upon Judah for their transgressions, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9-11</a>.
