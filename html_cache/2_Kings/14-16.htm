The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a peaceful transition and continuity with the ancestors. It reflects the belief in an afterlife where the deceased join their forebears. Jehoash's reign was marked by military conflicts and efforts to restore Israel's power, as seen in his victories over Aram (<a href="/2_kings/13-25.htm">2 Kings 13:25</a>).<p><b>and was buried in Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, established by King Omri. It served as the political and religious center of the northern tribes. The burial of Jehoash in Samaria signifies his status as a legitimate king of Israel. Archaeological excavations in Samaria have uncovered remnants of the city's fortifications and palaces, providing insight into the period's wealth and influence.<p><b>with the kings of Israel</b><br>This phrase underscores Jehoash's inclusion in the royal lineage of Israel, despite the moral and spiritual failings often associated with the northern kings. The kings of Israel, unlike those of Judah, were frequently criticized by the biblical authors for leading the people into idolatry and away from the worship of Yahweh. This burial tradition highlights the importance of dynastic continuity and the honor accorded to kingship.<p><b>And his son Jeroboam reigned in his place</b><br>Jeroboam II succeeded Jehoash as king, continuing the dynastic line. His reign is noted for its prosperity and territorial expansion, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23-29</a>. Jeroboam II's rule fulfilled the prophecy of Jonah, son of Amittai, who predicted the restoration of Israel's borders (<a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). Despite the material success, Jeroboam II's reign was marked by spiritual decline, as the people continued in the sins of Jeroboam I, who led Israel into idolatry. This period foreshadows the eventual downfall of the Northern Kingdom due to its persistent unfaithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoash.htm">Jehoash (Joash)</a></b><br>King of Israel who reigned in Samaria.

The phrase &#8220;rested with his fathers&#8221; is a standard biblical way of describing death (see <a href="/1_kings/2-10.htm">1 Kings 2:10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-9.htm">2 Kings 13:9</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds us that life spans are finite; even successful kings meet the same end as common folk (<a href="/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>).<p>&#8226; There is also a hint of continuity&#8212;Jehoash joins the line of earlier Israelite rulers whose stories are woven into God&#8217;s larger narrative (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel</b><p>&#8226; Samaria was the capital of the northern kingdom from the days of Omri (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). By noting Jehoash&#8217;s burial there, the text places him squarely within Israel&#8217;s royal heritage.<p>&#8226; Burial among the previous kings underscores national stability; no coup disrupted the dynasty at his death (contrast <a href="/2_kings/10-35.htm">2 Kings 10:35</a> with <a href="/2_kings/9-28.htm">2 Kings 9:28</a> for times when burial sites signaled turmoil).<p>&#8226; Yet Samaria also reminds us of the northern kingdom&#8217;s chronic idolatry (<a href="/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5&#8211;6</a>). The same ground that preserved regal honor also bore witness to spiritual compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his son Jeroboam reigned in his place</b><p>&#8226; Succession happens immediately: &#8220;And his son Jeroboam reigned in his place&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/14-16.htm">2 Kings 14:16</a>). God had already allowed the Jehu dynasty four generations on the throne (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>), and Jeroboam II becomes the third of those four.<p>&#8226; Jeroboam II&#8217;s long reign (<a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23</a>) will bring political expansion, fulfilling the prophetic word of Jonah (<a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the new king &#8220;did evil in the sight of the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/14-24.htm">2 Kings 14:24</a>), walking in the sins of the original Jeroboam I (<a href="/1_kings/14-16.htm">1 Kings 14:16</a>). The verse therefore sets up a tension: outward prosperity versus continued spiritual decline (<a href="/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s patience is evident; in spite of ongoing idolatry He still preserves Israel for the sake of His covenant purposes (<a href="/2_kings/13-23.htm">2 Kings 13:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/14-16.htm">2 Kings 14:16</a> is more than a passing obituary. The death of Jehoash, his burial in Samaria, and the ascension of Jeroboam II mark a turning point where political stability persists even as spiritual compromise continues. The verse quietly reminds us of human mortality, highlights national continuity, and foreshadows God&#8217;s mercy and impending correction&#8212;all threads that Scripture will pick up again in the prophetic books that follow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/14-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Jehoash</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3060.htm">Strong's 3060: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joash -- 'Yah is strong', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rested</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;ka&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
