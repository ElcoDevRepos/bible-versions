Egypt was a dominant power, and Neco's intervention in Judah's affairs demonstrates Egypt's influence over the region. Jehoahaz, son of Josiah, had only reigned for three months before being deposed, indicating his lack of power and the fragile state of Judah. This imprisonment signifies a shift in control and a loss of autonomy for Judah.<p><b>at Riblah in the land of Hamath</b><br>Riblah was a strategic location in the land of Hamath, situated in modern-day Syria. It served as a military and administrative center for the Egyptians and later the Babylonians. The choice of Riblah for Jehoahaz's imprisonment underscores its importance as a site of political and military significance. This location was often used by foreign powers to exert control over the region, as seen later with Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.<p><b>so that he could not reign in Jerusalem</b><br>By removing Jehoahaz from Jerusalem, Pharaoh Neco effectively prevented him from exercising any royal authority. This act of deposing a king and installing a puppet ruler was a common practice among ancient empires to maintain control over vassal states. It highlights the vulnerability of Judah and the diminishing power of the Davidic line during this period.<p><b>and he imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold</b><br>The imposition of a levy was a typical method of asserting dominance and extracting wealth from subjugated territories. A hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold represent a significant financial burden on Judah, reflecting the economic strain and subservience to Egypt. This tribute would have been a heavy tax on the people, further weakening the kingdom's resources and stability. The financial demands also illustrate the broader theme of judgment and consequence for the nation's disobedience to God, as seen throughout the prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh_neco.htm">Pharaoh Neco</a></b><br>The Egyptian Pharaoh who played a significant role in the political landscape of the region during this period.

Riding that momentum, he advanced northward and seized control of the region stretching from Egypt to the Euphrates (<a href="/2_kings/24-7.htm">2 Kings 24:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Riblah, on the Orontes River in Hamath (modern Syria), served as Neco&#8217;s military headquarters&#8212;a convenient staging point between Egypt and the Assyrian heartland. Its use here anticipates Babylon&#8217;s later use of the same city to judge King Zedekiah (<a href="/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; By physically removing Jehoahaz, Neco ensured Egypt&#8212;not Judah&#8212;called the shots. This fulfilled covenant warnings that disobedient kings would be taken to foreign soil (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>) and echoed Jeremiah&#8217;s word that Jehoahaz (also called Shallum) would &#8220;die in the place where they led him captive&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The event shows God&#8217;s sovereign hand using foreign powers to discipline His people, exactly as the prophets had warned (<a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-15</a>; 21:10-15).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that he could not reign in Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226; Jehoahaz reigned only three months (<a href="/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>). His early removal cut short any hope of national revival after Josiah&#8217;s reforms.<p>&#8226; Political power now lay outside Judah; Jerusalem&#8217;s king existed only at the pleasure of Egypt. Neco promptly installed Jehoahaz&#8217;s brother Eliakim, renaming him Jehoiakim to signify vassal status (<a href="/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>).<p>&#8226; This shift marked a step toward the coming exile, a reminder that rejecting God&#8217;s covenant invites foreign domination (<a href="/1_kings/9-6.htm">1 Kings 9:6-7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, it warned the people that earthly security rests not in kings or alliances but in faithful obedience to the Lord (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold</b><p>&#8226; One hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold represented several tons of precious metal&#8212;a crushing economic blow.

Judah&#8217;s sin led to foreign domination, economic hardship, and political humiliation. Yet even in judgment, Scripture reminds us of the Lord&#8217;s control over history and His call to wholehearted obedience&#8212;a timeless lesson underscored by the fate of Jehoahaz and his nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">And Pharaoh-nechoh put him in bands . . .</span>--See Note on <a href="/2_chronicles/36-3.htm" title="And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.">2Chronicles 36:3</a>.

Riblah (now <span class= "ital">Ribleh</span>) lay in a strong position on the Orontes, commanding the caravan route from Palestine to the Euphrates.

The passage, <a href="/ezekiel/19-4.htm" title="The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 19:4</a>, suggests that he got the king of Judah into his power by fraud: "he was taken in their pit."

Kadytis has been thought to be either <span class= "ital">Hadath</span> ("the new town;" referring to the rebuilding of Jerusalem after the Return), or <span class= "ital">el-Kuds</span>("the holy;" the modern Arabic title of Jerusalem), or Gaza. In reality it is Kadesh on the Orontes, one of the great Hittite capitals, and not far from Hamath. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh-Nechoh put him in bands at Riblah.</span> "Riblah," which retains its name, was situated in the Coele-Syrian plain, on the right bank of the Orontes, in lat. 34&deg; 23' N. nearly. It commanded a ford over the river (Condor, 'Heth and Moab,' p. 17), and is in the midst of a rich, corn-producing country. Hamath, to which it was regarded as belonging, is situated more than fifty miles further down the river. Riblah was well placed as a center for communication with the neighboring countries. As Dr. Robinson says ('Researches,' vol. 3. p. 545), "From this point the roads were open by Aleppo and the Euphrates to Nineveh, or by Palmyra (Tadmor) to Babylon, by the end of Lebanon and the coast to Palestine (Philistia) and Egypt, or through the, Buka'a and the Jordan valley to the center of the Holy Land." Nebuchadnezzar followed the example of Nechoh in making Ribiah his headquarters during his sieges of Tyro and Jerusalem (see <a href="/2_kings/25-21.htm">2 Kings 25:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9, 10, 26, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the land of Hamath.</span> The "land of Hamath" was the upper part of the Coele-Syrian valley from about lat. 34&deg; to lat. 35&deg; 30' N. <span class="cmt_word">That he might not reign in Jerusalem.</span> Nechoh might naturally distrust the people's choice. He might also regard the setting up of any king at Jerusalem without his sanction as an act of contumacy on the part of a nation which had been practically conquered by the complete defeat of Josiah at Megiddo. Whether his conduct in seizing Jehoahaz after inviting him to a conference was justifiable or not may be questioned; but, in point of fact, he did but use the right of the conqueror somewhat harshly. <span class="cmt_word">And put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.</span> (So Josephus, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) The tribute was a very moderate one. A century earlier Sennacherib had enacted a tribute of three hundred talents of silver, <span class="accented">and thirty</span> of gold (see above, <a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>). We may conjecture that Nechoh wished to conciliate the Jews, regarding them as capable of rendering him good service in the struggle, on which he had entered, with Babylon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/23-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Pharaoh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;ar&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">Neco</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6549.htm">Strong's 6549: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neco -- an Egyptian king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">imprisoned Jehoahaz</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8217;as&#183;r&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
