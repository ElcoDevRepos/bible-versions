In the biblical context, this powerlessness is attributed to divine intervention. Theologically, it underscores the belief that human strength is insignificant without God's support. Historically, the Assyrian Empire was known for its might, yet here, they are depicted as powerless, emphasizing God's sovereignty over nations.<p><b>are dismayed and ashamed.</b><br>Dismay and shame are emotional responses to defeat and humiliation. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, military defeat was not only a physical loss but also a spiritual and social disgrace. This reflects the biblical theme that those who oppose God and His people will ultimately face shame and defeat, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/83-17.htm">Psalm 83:17</a>.<p><b>They are like plants in the field,</b><br>This simile compares the inhabitants to plants, suggesting their vulnerability and transience. In biblical literature, plants often symbolize human frailty and the temporary nature of life (<a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>). This imagery reinforces the idea that without God's protection, even the strongest nations are fragile.<p><b>tender green shoots,</b><br>Tender green shoots represent new, undeveloped growth, indicating a lack of maturity and strength. This can be seen as a metaphor for the initial promise or potential that is ultimately unfulfilled due to divine judgment. It reflects the biblical principle that without God's blessing, potential remains unrealized.<p><b>grass on the rooftops,</b><br>Grass on rooftops is an image of futility and impermanence. In ancient Israel, roofs were flat and often covered with a thin layer of soil where grass might sprout but would not thrive due to lack of depth and nourishment. This symbolizes the superficial and fleeting nature of the enemies' power and success, as also mentioned in <a href="/psalms/129-6.htm">Psalm 129:6</a>.<p><b>scorched before it is grown.</b><br>This phrase conveys the idea of destruction before maturity, emphasizing the sudden and complete nature of divine judgment. It suggests that the plans and strength of the enemies are thwarted before they can come to fruition. This imagery is consistent with the biblical theme of God's intervention to protect His people and frustrate the plans of the wicked, as seen in <a href="/job/8-12.htm">Job 8:12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.

Because the Lord planned the event, the people who lived in those fortified places could not stand against the Assyrian assault. In the same way God earlier told Joshua, &#8220;I have delivered them into your hand&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>), He now explains that the fall of these nations was part of His purposeful design.<p>&#8226; The defeat is not random; it flows from divine sovereignty (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; When God decides a boundary, no army or wall can overturn it (<a href="/job/12-23.htm">Job 12:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>devoid of power</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;devoid of power&#8230;&#8221; highlights the complete helplessness of these peoples.

Any human might apart from God is an empty shell (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>).

The same pairing surfaces when Israel&#8217;s enemies crumble before the ark in <a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6-7</a>&#8212;terror first, then disgrace. God not only breaks human pride; He exposes it so that His glory shines brighter (<a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are like plants in the field</b><p>The verse shifts to imagery: &#8220;They are like plants in the field.&#8221; Field grass appears beautiful yet fragile, an Old Testament picture of human transience (<a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>, <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-7</a>). Nations rise quickly, dominate briefly, and wither just as fast when God breathes on them (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>tender green shoots</b><p>The comparison tightens: &#8220;like tender green shoots.&#8221; These first sprouts look vibrant but possess no depth. <a href="/hosea/6-4.htm">Hosea 6:4</a> laments an identical fickleness&#8212;&#8220;your loyalty is like the early dew.&#8221; Early vigor without rootedness cannot endure testing (<a href="/luke/8-6.htm">Luke 8:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>grass on the rooftops</b><p>Next comes &#8220;grass on the rooftops.&#8221; Flat Middle-Eastern roofs collected a thin layer of dust where seeds could sprout, yet the shallow surface offered little moisture. <a href="/psalms/129-6.htm">Psalm 129:6</a> uses the same picture for those who oppose Zion: &#8220;May they be like grass on the rooftops, which withers before it can grow.&#8221; A life or empire that never sinks roots in God&#8217;s soil will inevitably dry up (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>scorched before it is grown</b><p>The final phrase&#8212;&#8220;scorched before it is grown&#8221;&#8212;describes a hot wind shriveling vegetation before maturity (<a href="/jonah/4-7.htm">Jonah 4:7</a>, <a href="/mark/4-6.htm">Mark 4:6</a>). God&#8217;s judgment can fall so swiftly that plans, armies, and monuments die in the bud. Sennacherib thought his conquests proved Assyria&#8217;s invincibility; God reveals that the conquered peoples were already withering when Assyria arrived, because He had ordained their downfall long before (<a href="/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/19-26.htm">2 Kings 19:26</a> teaches that the Lord alone determines the rise and fall of nations. The peoples crushed by Assyria were powerless because God had removed their strength. Their fear and shame, compared to short-lived rooftop grass, underscore human frailty apart from Him. The verse stands as a sober reminder that every apparent triumph or collapse happens under God&#8217;s sovereign hand, calling us to trust Him rather than any earthly might.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Of small power.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">short-handed.</span> (Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/1-2.htm" title="Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.">Isaiah 1:2, Isa_59:1</a>.)

They are like fascinated birds before the stealthy advance of the serpent. <span class="cmt_word">They were dismayed and confounded.</span> Historically, the prophet declares, this was the cause of the general collapse of the nations whom the Assyrians attacked. God put a craven fear into their hearts. <span class="cmt_word">They were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house-tops.</span> The "grass of the field" is one of the most frequent similes for weakness. "All flesh is grass" (<a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6</a>); "They shall soon be cut down like the grass" (<a href="/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>); "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth" (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>); "I am withered like grass" (<a href="/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11</a>). In the hot sun of an Eastern sky nothing faded more quickly. But this weakness was intensified in the "grass of the house-tops." It "withered before it grew up" (<a href="/psalms/129-6.htm">Psalm 129:6</a>). The depth of earth was so slight, the exposure so great, the heat so scorching, that it sank in death almost as soon as it had sprung to life. Such has been the weakness of the nations given over as a prey to the Assyrians. <span class="cmt_word">And as corn blasted before it be grown up.</span> Corn blasted before it shoots into a stalk is as frail as grass, or frailer. It dwindles and disappears without even asserting itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/19-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore their inhabitants,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1465;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#183;hen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
