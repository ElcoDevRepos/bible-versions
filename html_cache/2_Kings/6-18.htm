This phrase sets the scene for a military confrontation. The Arameans were likely coming from the north, as their capital was Damascus. Historically, the Arameans were a powerful group, often clashing with Israel over territory and influence. This context highlights the constant threat Israel faced from surrounding nations, emphasizing the need for divine intervention.<p><b>Elisha prayed to the LORD</b><br>Elisha, the successor of Elijah, was a prophet known for his miracles and close relationship with God. His immediate response to pray underscores the importance of seeking divine guidance and intervention in times of crisis. This act of prayer reflects a deep trust in God's power and willingness to act on behalf of His people. Elisha's reliance on prayer serves as a model for believers, illustrating the power of prayer in overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges.<p><b>&#8220;Please strike these people with blindness.&#8221;</b><br>Elisha's specific request for blindness is significant. In biblical terms, blindness often symbolizes spiritual ignorance or a lack of understanding. By asking for physical blindness, Elisha is effectively neutralizing the threat without resorting to violence. This request demonstrates the prophet's wisdom and reliance on God's power to protect His people in a non-lethal manner. It also foreshadows the New Testament theme of spiritual blindness and the need for divine revelation to see the truth.<p><b>So He struck them with blindness</b><br>God's immediate response to Elisha's prayer highlights His sovereignty and willingness to act on behalf of His servants. This divine intervention serves as a testament to God's power and the authority granted to His prophets. The miraculous nature of this event underscores the reality of God's involvement in the affairs of His people and His ability to alter the natural order to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>according to the word of Elisha</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the authority and prophetic power vested in Elisha. It shows that God honors the words of His prophets, fulfilling their requests when they align with His will. This connection between the prophet's word and God's action is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating the close relationship between God and His chosen messengers. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's word through Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh, who has authority over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God, successor to Elijah, known for his miracles and deep relationship with God.
