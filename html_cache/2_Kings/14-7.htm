The Valley of Salt is likely located near the southern end of the Dead Sea, a region known for its salt deposits. This victory over Edom is significant as it demonstrates God's favor upon Amaziah's reign, despite his later failures. The Edomites were long-standing adversaries of Israel, and this victory echoes earlier conflicts, such as those during the reign of King David (<a href="/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a>). The number 10,000 may symbolize a complete or decisive victory, a common biblical motif.<p><b>He took Sela in battle</b><br>Sela, meaning "rock" in Hebrew, is identified with the city of Petra, a stronghold in Edom. This conquest indicates a strategic victory, as Sela was a fortified city, crucial for controlling trade routes. The capture of Sela underscores Amaziah's military prowess and the temporary subjugation of Edom under Judah's control. This event is a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Rebekah that the older (Esau/Edom) would serve the younger (Jacob/Israel) (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>).<p><b>and called it Joktheel,</b><br>Renaming Sela to Joktheel, which means "subdued by God," reflects Amaziah's acknowledgment of divine intervention in his victory. This act of renaming is a common biblical practice, signifying a change in status or ownership, as seen when Abram's name was changed to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>). It also serves as a testament to God's power and the fulfillment of His promises to Israel.<p><b>which is its name to this very day.</b><br>The phrase "to this very day" suggests the enduring impact of Amaziah's conquest and the lasting memory of this event in the historical consciousness of Israel. It emphasizes the historical reliability of the biblical narrative and the continuity of God's dealings with His people. This phrase is often used in Scripture to affirm the authenticity and permanence of God's actions and their recorded history, as seen in other passages like <a href="/joshua/4-9.htm">Joshua 4:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned after his father Joash.

On their way back they attacked and plundered certain of the cities of Judah. The fall of Selah was followed by a massacre of captives. The gods of Edom, which Amaziah carried off, proved a snare to him.

Since that time the two countries had remained at peace. Now, however, Amaziah resolved upon a great effort to resubjugate them. According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:9. &sect; 1) and Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-5.htm">2 Chronicles 25:5</a>), he levied an army of 400,000 men - 300,000 Jews, and 100,000 hired Israelites - with which he marched against the three nations of the Amalekites, the Idumaeans, and the Gabalites. Rebuked by a prophet for want of faith in calling to his aid the wicked Israelites, he consented to dismiss them, and made the invasion at the head of his own troops only. These were carefully organized (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-5.htm">2 Chronicles 25:5</a>), and met with a great success. Ten thousand of his enemies fell in battle, and an equal number were made prisoners. These last were barbarously put to death by being precipitated from the top of a rock (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-12.htm">2 Chronicles 25:12</a>). "The valley of salt," the scene of the battle, is probably identified with the sunken plain, now called <span class="accented">Es Sabkah</span>, at the southern extremity of the Dead Sea. This is "a large flat of at least six miles by ten, occasionally flooded" (Tristram), but dry in the summertime. It is full of salt springs, and is bounded on the west and northwest by a long ridge of pure salt, known as the <span class="accented">Khasm Usdum</span>, so that the name "valley of salt" would be very appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">And took Selah by war.</span> Selah with the article (<span class="accented">has-Selah</span>) can only be the Idumaean capital, which the Greeks called Petra (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), and which is one of the most remarkable sites in the world. In the rocky mountains which form the eastern boundary of the Arabah or sandy slope reaching from the edge of the Sabkah to the Red Sea, amid cliffs of gorgeous colors, pink and crimson and purple, and ravines as deep and narrow as that of Proffers, partly excavated in the rook, partly emplaced upon it, stood the Edomite town, difficult to approach, still more difficult to capture, more like the home of a colony of sea-gulls than that of a number of men. Petra is graphically described by Dean Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 88-92), and has also received notice from Robinson ('Researches,' vol. it. pp. 518-538), Highten ('Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 3. p. 1191), and others. <span class="cmt_word">And called the name of it Joktheel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "subdued by God." The name took no permanent hold. Selah is still "Sela" in Isaiah (Isaiah 16:1), Obadiah (ver. Obadiah 1:3), and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 49:16). It is known only as "Petra" to the Greeks and Romans. <span class="cmt_word">Unto this day</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> the time of the writer who composed the account of Amaziah's reign for the 'Book of the Kings,' and whoso words the author of Kings transcribes here as so often elsewhere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/14-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Amaziah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">struck down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hik&#183;k&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5221.htm">Strong's 5221: </a> </span><span class="str2">To strike</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ten</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;e&#183;re&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6235.htm">Strong's 6235: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">thousand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1508;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;l&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_505.htm">Strong's 505: </a> </span><span class="str2">A thousand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Edomites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1491;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_123.htm">Strong's 123: </a> </span><span class="str2">The name of a condiment</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the Valley of Salt.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1490;&#1461;&#1497;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7713;&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
