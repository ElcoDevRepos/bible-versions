The Assyrians were known for their military prowess and psychological warfare, often attempting to demoralize their enemies. Here, the Rabshakeh claims divine sanction for his actions, suggesting that the LORD, the God of Israel, has commanded him to attack Jerusalem. This reflects a common ancient Near Eastern belief that military victories were often seen as endorsed by the gods. Theologically, this raises questions about divine sovereignty and human agency, as well as the interpretation of events as being under God's control. The Assyrian claim could be seen as a test of faith for Hezekiah and the people of Judah, challenging them to trust in God's promises despite the circumstances.<p><b>The LORD Himself said to me, &#8216;Go up against this land and destroy it.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The Rabshakeh's assertion that the LORD Himself commanded the attack is a bold and provocative statement. It is unlikely that the Assyrians had received a direct revelation from the God of Israel, and this claim could be seen as a tactic to instill fear and doubt among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. In the broader biblical narrative, God sometimes uses foreign nations as instruments of judgment against His people, as seen in the Babylonian exile (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). However, the Assyrian's claim here is not supported by any prophetic word from the LORD to Judah. This statement can be contrasted with the true prophetic messages given to Hezekiah through Isaiah, who assured the king of God's deliverance (<a href="/isaiah/37-6.htm">Isaiah 37:6-7</a>). The Rabshakeh's words serve as a reminder of the importance of discerning true divine guidance from false claims, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_hezekiah.htm">King Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to rid Judah of idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The king of Assyria, who invaded Judah and laid siege to Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabshakeh.htm">Rabshakeh</a></b><br>The Assyrian field commander who delivered the message to the people of Jerusalem, claiming divine sanction for the invasion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, under threat from the Assyrian army.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whom the Assyrians claimed had commanded them to attack Judah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_of_false_claims.htm">Discernment of False Claims</a></b><br>Just because someone claims divine authority does not mean it is true.

By contrasting the envoy&#8217;s claim with the broader narrative and cross-references, Scripture shows that:<p>&#8226; God may allow pagan powers to rise, yet He never relinquishes His covenant promises.<p>&#8226; Enemy rhetoric often mimics divine language to sow doubt.<p>&#8226; Genuine reliance on the LORD, as modeled by Hezekiah, exposes lies and invites divine deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">The Lord said to me.</span>--Michaelis supposed that Sennacherib had consulted some of the captive priests of the Northern kingdom. Others think some report of the menaces of the Hebrew prophets may have reached Assyrian ears. Thenius makes Rab-shakeh's words a mere inference from the success which had hitherto attended the expedition; but the language is too definite for this. In the annals of Nabuna'id, the last king of Babylon, a remarkable parallel occurs. The Persian Cyrus there represents himself as enjoying the special favour of Merodach the chief god of Babylon; Merodach foretells his march upon the city, and accompanies him thither. Cyrus even declares that he has daily offered prayers to Bel and Nebo, that they might intercede with Merodach on his behalf. From all this it would appear to have been customary with invaders to seek to win the gods of hostile countries to the furtherance of their schemes of conquest. (Comp. the account of the taking of Veii in <span class= "ital">Livy, v.</span> 21, especially the sentence beginning "Veientes ignari se jam ab suis vatibus, jam ab externis oraculis proditos;" and Macrob. <span class= "ital">Sat. iii.</span> 9.) It is not impossible that there was some renegade prophet of Jehovah in the Assyrian camp. At all events, the <span class= "ital">form</span> of the oracle, "Go up against this land, and destroy it," is thoroughly authentic. Comp. the oracle of Chemosh to Mesha: "And Chemosh said unto me, Go thou, seize Nebo against Israel" (<span class= "ital">Moabite Stone,</span> 1. 14). Meanwhile, <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm" title="O Assyrian, the rod of my anger, and the staff in their hand is my indignation.">Isaiah 10:5</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span> shows how true was the boast of the arrogant invader, in a sense which lay far above his heathenish apprehension.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Am I now come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it?

It is difficult to account for Sennacherib's very exceptional boast, "Jehovah said to me. Go up against this laud." Perhaps he identifies "Jehovah" with "Asshur." Perhaps he has heard of prophecies, uttered in the name of Jehovah, by Jewish prophets, which threatened the land with desolation at the hand of the Assyrians (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/isaiah/7-17.htm">Isaiah 7:17-24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-12</a>; <a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1-11</a>, etc.).
