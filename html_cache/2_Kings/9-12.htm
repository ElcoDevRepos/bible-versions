This reflects the tension and distrust prevalent in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during this period. The officers' reaction indicates a culture of suspicion, possibly due to the political instability and frequent coups that characterized Israel's monarchy. This skepticism can also be seen as a reflection of the broader spiritual decline in Israel, where the word of the LORD was often met with disbelief or outright rejection.<p><b>&#8220;Tell us now!&#8221;</b><br>The demand for immediate truth underscores the urgency and seriousness of the situation. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the anointing of a king was a significant event, often accompanied by divine sanction. The officers' insistence on knowing the truth highlights the importance of prophetic messages in guiding political actions. This urgency also reflects the volatile nature of leadership in Israel, where power struggles were common, and the support of military leaders was crucial for any claim to the throne.<p><b>So Jehu answered,</b><br>Jehu's response marks a pivotal moment in the narrative. As a commander in the army, his acknowledgment of the prophetic message signifies his acceptance of the divine mandate. This moment is critical in the unfolding of God's judgment against the house of Ahab, as prophesied by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>). Jehu's role as an instrument of divine justice is a recurring theme in the biblical narrative, where God raises leaders to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>&#8220;He talked to me about this and that, saying,</b><br>Jehu's initial vagueness may indicate his hesitation or the sensitive nature of the message. In the cultural context, discussing matters of kingship and divine anointing was fraught with danger, especially in a politically charged environment. This phrase also reflects the common practice of prophets delivering messages in private before they were publicly declared, ensuring the recipient's understanding and acceptance.<p><b>&#8216;This is what the LORD says:</b><br>The phrase introduces the divine authority behind the message. In the biblical tradition, the formula "This is what the LORD says" is used to convey the certainty and authority of God's word. It emphasizes that the message is not of human origin but is a direct communication from God. This divine endorsement is crucial for legitimizing Jehu's claim to the throne and his subsequent actions.<p><b>I anoint you king over Israel.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The anointing of Jehu as king is a fulfillment of God's judgment against the house of Ahab. Anointing was a sacred act, symbolizing God's choice and empowerment of a leader. This event connects to earlier biblical narratives where anointing signifies divine selection, such as the anointing of David by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). Jehu's anointing also prefigures the ultimate anointed one, the Messiah, who would fulfill God's redemptive purposes. The act of anointing underscores the theme of divine sovereignty in the establishment and removal of kings, a central motif in the books of Kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>A commander in the army of Israel, chosen by God to become king and tasked with eradicating the house of Ahab.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet's_messenger.htm">Prophet's Messenger</a></b><br>A young prophet sent by Elisha to anoint Jehu as king over Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, where Jehu was anointed to rule.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_ahab.htm">House of Ahab</a></b><br>The ruling dynasty in Israel, known for its idolatry and wickedness, which Jehu was commanded to destroy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>The prophet who directed the anointing of Jehu, continuing the work of his predecessor, Elijah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_appointment.htm">Divine Appointment</a></b><br>God chooses leaders according to His purpose, often in unexpected ways.

Scripture often records initial unbelief when God speaks in unexpected ways&#8212;think of Sarah&#8217;s laughter in <a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a> or the disciples&#8217; doubt in <a href="/luke/24-11.htm">Luke 24:11</a>.<p>&#8226;

Their urgency echoes the crowds at Pentecost who pleaded, &#8220;Brothers, what shall we do?&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s revelations demand a response; neutrality is impossible once His word has gone forth (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So Jehu answered</b><p>&#8226;

This moment marks the transition from private commissioning to public accountability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;He talked to me about this and that&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jehu summarizes the prophet&#8217;s preliminary words&#8212;details that are secondary to the central message.<p>&#8226; The phrase signals that the heart of the encounter was not casual conversation but divine mandate (cf. <a href="/2_kings/8-11.htm">2 Kings 8:11</a>, where prophetic focus overrides small talk).<p>&#8226; God may use ordinary settings to deliver extraordinary commands, yet the command itself remains crystal clear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;This is what the LORD says&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jehu shifts from human conversation to divine authority.<p>&#8226;

Like David&#8217;s anointing in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>, Jehu&#8217;s anointing is both a present spiritual reality and a future political certainty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/9-12.htm">2 Kings 9:12</a> records the pivotal moment when a reluctant group of officers presses Jehu to reveal a prophet&#8217;s message, only to hear that the LORD Himself has anointed Jehu king. Their disbelief turns to urgency; Jehu&#8217;s private call becomes public; and God&#8217;s sovereign word, announced with absolute authority, sets in motion the overthrow of a corrupt dynasty. The verse teaches that when God speaks, His purpose stands, disbelief is confronted, and those He calls must step forward in faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">It is false.</span>--This is rather too strong, and does not convey the exact force of the reply.
