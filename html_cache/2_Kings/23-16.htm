His turning here signifies a moment of action and decision, reflecting his commitment to eradicating idolatry from the land. This action is part of a broader narrative where Josiah is actively purging the land of pagan practices.<p><b>he saw the tombs there on the hillside</b><br>The tombs on the hillside likely belonged to the idolatrous priests and individuals who had been involved in pagan worship. In ancient Israel, tombs were often located outside city limits, on hillsides or in caves. The visibility of these tombs to Josiah underscores the pervasive nature of idolatry that had infiltrated the land.<p><b>and he sent someone to take the bones out of the tombs</b><br>Removing bones from tombs was a significant act of desecration. In the ancient Near East, disturbing a grave was considered a severe violation, reflecting Josiah's determination to cleanse the land of its idolatrous past. This act symbolically breaks the power and memory of those who led Israel astray.<p><b>and he burned them on the altar to defile it</b><br>Burning bones on an altar was a deliberate act to render it unclean and unusable for worship. This action was a direct affront to the pagan practices that had been conducted there, ensuring that the altar could no longer be used for idolatrous sacrifices. It reflects the biblical principle of destroying objects associated with false worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>).<p><b>according to the word of the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that Josiah's actions were in obedience to divine command. The reforms he enacted were not merely political or personal but were rooted in fulfilling God's will as revealed through His prophets. This obedience highlights the importance of aligning actions with God's word.<p><b>proclaimed by the man of God</b><br>The "man of God" refers to a prophet who had previously spoken against the idolatrous practices in Israel. Prophets in the Old Testament served as God's messengers, often calling the people back to covenant faithfulness. This reference underscores the continuity of God's message and the fulfillment of prophecy.<p><b>who had foretold these things</b><br>The fulfillment of prophecy is a recurring theme in the Bible, demonstrating God's sovereignty and faithfulness. The specific prophecy referenced here is found in <a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>, where a man of God from Judah prophesied that a king named Josiah would defile the altar at Bethel.

Josiah is in the middle of personally supervising the cleansing of Bethel, the northern center of idolatry established by Jeroboam (<a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15</a>).<p>&#8226; His &#8220;turning&#8221; shows active, hands-on leadership&#8212;echoing the earlier resolve of his ancestor Hezekiah (2 Chron 31:1).<p>&#8226; Application: wholehearted reform requires continual, intentional movement away from compromise (cf. <a href="/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He saw the tombs there on the hillside</b><p>&#8226; The hill (lit. &#8220;mountain&#8221;) surrounding Bethel was dotted with graves, many belonging to the very priests who had served the golden calf altar (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>).<p>&#8226; What catches Josiah&#8217;s eye is not random scenery but the physical evidence of a spiritual legacy&#8212;dead men who promoted dead religion (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often links high places with false worship; even the burial plots are reminders of disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He sent someone to take the bones out of the tombs</b><p>&#8226; Removing bones violated normal respect for the dead, underlining the severity of God&#8217;s judgment (<a href="/numbers/19-16.htm">Numbers 19:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Josiah&#8217;s command fulfills Deuteronomy-style obedience: obliterate every trace of idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>).<p>&#8226; By delegating the task, the king ensures the reform reaches every layer of society&#8212;leadership initiates, people participate (2 Chron 34:4).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He burned them on the altar to defile it</b><p>&#8226; Burning human remains on a pagan altar made it ceremonially unclean and unusable (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; This act reverses the altar&#8217;s purpose: what was meant for false worship becomes a monument to divine judgment (<a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Josiah&#8217;s action mirrors earlier reforms, where altars were demolished and ashes scattered (2 Chron 34:5); here, defilement guarantees the site&#8217;s permanent closure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>According to the word of the LORD proclaimed by the man of God who had foretold these things</b><p>&#8226;

Josiah&#8217;s zeal literally fulfills that prophecy, proving God&#8217;s sovereignty over time and nations (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The reliability of Scripture is underscored: every word spoken by God comes to pass (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>;

He argues that it must be an interpolation here, because (1) the "moreover" of <a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2Kings 23:15</a> (<span class= "ital">w</span>?<span class= "ital">gam</span>) corresponds to the "and . . . also" (<span class= "ital">w</span>?<span class= "ital">gam</span>) of <a href="/2_kings/23-19.htm" title="And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.">2Kings 23:19</a>, which does not prove much; and because (2) Josiah could not pollute the altar (<a href="/2_kings/23-16.htm" title="And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchers that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them on the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.">2Kings 23:16</a>) after he had already <span class= "ital">shattered it in pieces</span> (<a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2Kings 23:15</a>). This reasoning is not conclusive, because it is obvious that, as is so often the case, the writer has first told in brief what was done to the altar and high place at Bethel, and then related at length an interesting incident that occurred at the time. In short, the statement of <a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2Kings 23:15</a> is anticipatory. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchers that were there in the mount.</span> The Israelite sepulchers, excavated in the reeky sides of hills, are everywhere conspicuous. Those of Bethel may have been in the low hill on which the town stands, or in the sides of the Wady Suweinit, a little further to the south. His <span class="accented">accidentally</span> "<span class="accented">spying</span> the sepulchers" gave Josiah the thought of completing his desecration of Bethel by having bones brought from them and burnt upon the altar - whereby he exactly accomplished the old prophecy (<a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>), which was not at all in his mind. <span class="cmt_word">And sent, end took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it</span> (see the comment on ver. 14), <span class="cmt_word">according to the word of the Lord which the men of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words</span>; rather, <span class="accented">who prophesied these things</span>.
