Babylon was a significant city in Mesopotamia, known for its advanced culture and later prominence in biblical prophecy. Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim were regions or cities within the Assyrian Empire, each with its own distinct cultural and religious practices. This resettlement strategy aimed to dilute nationalistic sentiments and prevent rebellion by mixing different peoples and cultures.<p><b>and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites.</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which had fallen to Assyria in 722 BC. The Israelites were exiled, fulfilling prophecies of judgment due to their persistent idolatry and disobedience to God (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>). The replacement of the Israelites with foreign peoples led to the emergence of the Samaritans, a mixed population with syncretic religious practices, which later caused tensions with the Jews returning from Babylonian exile (<a href="/ezra/4.htm">Ezra 4:1-5</a>).<p><b>They took possession of Samaria and lived in its towns.</b><br>The new inhabitants took over the land and infrastructure left by the exiled Israelites. This occupation marked a significant shift in the region's demographic and religious landscape. The settlers brought their own gods and practices, which led to a blending of beliefs and the eventual development of a distinct Samaritan identity. This change set the stage for future conflicts between Samaritans and Jews, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>).

Scripture consistently presents Assyria as a rod in the Lord&#8217;s hand: &#8220;Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>). The narrative has already noted the invasion: &#8220;Shalmaneser king of Assyria attacked him, and Hoshea became his vassal&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3</a>). God&#8217;s sovereignty stands out; what looks like imperial policy is ultimately divine discipline (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-52</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim</b><p>Assyria&#8217;s strategy was population relocation.

The lost tribes are not merely missing; they are supplanted. Hosea had prophesied, &#8220;You are not My people&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/1-9.htm">Hosea 1:9</a>). The covenant curses fell because &#8220;the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them from His presence&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>). God&#8217;s faithfulness to His word, even in judgment, is sobering (cf. <a href="/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They took possession of Samaria</b><p>These newcomers claimed houses, fields, and the city&#8217;s strategic hilltop. Micah foresaw: &#8220;I will make Samaria a heap of rubble&#8221; (<a href="/micah/1-6.htm">Micah 1:6</a>).

The verse highlights God&#8217;s sovereign use of nations, the tragic cost of persistent rebellion, and the historical roots of the Samaritan identity. The accuracy of Scripture&#8217;s prophecies and their outworking in real time call believers to trust the Lord&#8217;s word, heed His warnings, and marvel at His unfolding redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24-33) <span class= "bld">RE-PEOPLING OF THE LAND WITH ALIENS; THEIR WORSHIP DESCRIBED.</span><p>(24) <span class= "bld">The king of Assyria.</span>--Sargon (<span class= "ital">Sargina</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> who actually records that in his first year (721 B.C. ) he settled a body of conquered Babylonians in the land of <span class= "ital">Hatti</span> or Syria. In another passage he speaks of locating certain Arab tribes, including those of Tham-d and Ephah, in the land of Beth-Omri; and in a third passage of his annals he says that he "removed the rest" of these Arab tribes, "and caused them to dwell in the city of Samerina" (Samaria). This notice be. longs to Sargon's seventh year (715 B.C. ). Kuthah and Sepharvaim were also towns in Babylonia. The former is called <span class= "ital">Kutie</span> in the cuneiform inscriptions. It had a temple of Nergal and Laz, the ruins of which have been discovered at <span class= "ital">Tell-Ibrahim,</span> north-east of Babylon. Sepharvaim, in the cuneiform <span class= "ital">Sipar</span> and <span class= "ital">Sippar,</span> means "the two Sipars;" in allusion, probably, to the fact that the town was divided between the two deities <span class= "ital">Samas</span> (the sun), and <span class= "ital">Anunitum,</span> and bore the names of <span class= "ital">Sippar sa Samas</span> ("Sippara of the Sun"), and <span class= "ital">Sippar sa Anunitum</span> ("Sippara of Anunit").

The writer, before dismissing the subject of the Israelite kingdom, proceeds to inform us of certain results of the conquest. Having removed the bulk of the native inhabitants, the Assyrians did not allow the country to lie waste, but proceeded to replace the population which they had carried off by settlers from other localities (ver. 24). These settlers were, after a short time, incommoded by lions, which increased upon them, and diminished their numbers (ver. 25). The idea arose that the visitation was supernatural, and might be traced to the fact that the newcomers, not knowing "the manner of the God of the land," displeased him by the neglect of his rites or by the introduction of alien worship (ver. 26). A remedy for this was sought in the sending to them from Assyria one of the priests who had been carried off, from whom it was thought they might learn how "the God of the land" was to be propitiated. This was the orion of the "mixed religion" which grew up in the country. While the nations who had replaced the Israelites brought in their own superstitions, and severally worshipped their own gods (vers. 30, 31), there was a general acknowledgment of Jehovah by all of them, and a continuance of Jehovistic worship in the various high places. The nations both "feared the Lord, and served their graven images," down to the time when the writer of Kings composed his work (vers. 33-41). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria brought men from Babylon.</span> It has been supposed, in connection with <a href="/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>, that no colonists were introduced into the country till the time of Esarhaddon, who began to reign in <span class="date">B.C. 681</span>. But this, which would be intrinsically most improbable (for when did a king forego his tribute from a fertile country for forty-one years?), is contradicted by a statement of Sargon, that he placed colonists there in <span class="date">B.C. 715</span> ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 415). These were not necessarily the first; and, on the whole, it is probable that the re-peopling of the country begun earlier. Hamath was reduced by Sargon in <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>, and punished severely. Its inhabitants were carried off, and replaced by Assyrians ('Eponym Canon,' p. 127). Probably some of them were at once settled in Samaria. The conquest of Babylon by Sargon was not till later. It occurred in <span class="date">B.C. 709</span>, and was probably followed by the immediate deportation of some of its inhabitants to the same quarter. <span class="cmt_word">And from Cuthah.</span> "Cuthah," or "Cutha," was an important Babylonian city, often mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 74, 75; vol. 3. p. 35; vol. 5. pp. 93, 94, 102). Its ruins exist at the site now called Ibrahim, about fifteen miles northeast of Babylon. Sargon must have become master of it when he put down Merodach-Baladan and assumed the sovereignty of Babylonia, in <span class="date">B.C. 709</span>. Why the later Jews called the Samaritans "Cuthaeans," rather than Sepharvites, or Avites, or Hamathites, it is impossible to determine. Possibly the Cuthaean settlers preponderated in numbers ever the others. <span class="cmt_word">And from Ava.</span> "Ava" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>) is probably the same as the Ivah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>) of <a href="/2_kings/18-34.htm">2 Kings 18:34</a> and 2 Kings 19:13, and perhaps identical with the Ahava (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>) of Ezra (Ezra 8:15, 21). The city intended is thought to be the "Is" of Herodotus (1. 179), and the modern Hit. Hit lies upon the Euphrates, about a hundred and thirty miles above Babylon, in lat. 33&deg; 45' nearly. It is famous for its bitumen springs. <span class="cmt_word">And from Hamath</span> (see the comment on 2 Kings 14:25). Hamath on the Orontes was conquered by Sargon in <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>, two years after his capture of Samaria ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 126-128). Its rude inhabitants were carried off, and Assyrians were placed there. <span class="cmt_word">And from Sepharvaim.</span> It is generally allowed that "Sepharvaim" is "Sippara," the dual form being accounted for by the fact that Sippara was a double town, partly on the right and partly on the left bank of a stream derived from the Euphrates. Hence Pliny speaks of it as "oppida Hipparenorum" ('Hist. Nat.,' 6:30). The exact site, at Abu-Habba, sixteen miles southwest of Baghdad, has only recently been discovered (see the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology' for 1885, vol. 8. pp. 172-176). <span class="cmt_word">And placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.</span> Transplantation of nations, commenced by Tiglath-pileser, was practiced on a still larger scale by Sargon. The following summary will illustrate this point: "In all his wars Sargon largely employed the system of wholesale deportation. The Israelites were removed from Samaria, and planted partly in Gozan or Mygdonia, and partly in the cities recently taken from the Medes. Hamath and Damascus were peopled with captives from Armenia and other regions of the north. A portion of the Tibareni were carried captive to Assyria, and Assyrians were established in the Tibarenian country. Vast numbers of the inhabitants of the Zagros range were also transported to Assyria; Babylonians, Cuthaeans, Sapharrites, Arabians, and others were placed in Samaria; men from the extreme east (perhaps Media) in Ashdod. The Comukha were removed from the extreme north to Susiana, and Chaldaeans were brought from the extreme south to supply their places. Everywhere Sargon 'changed the abodes' of his subjects, his aim being, as it would seem, to weaken the stronger races by dispersion, and to destroy the spirit of the weaker ones by severing at a blow all the links which unite a patriotic people to the country it has long inhabited. The practice had not been unknown to previous monarchs; but it had never been employed by any of them so generally or on so grand a scale as it was by this king" (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 423). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/17-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Assyria</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1441;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#353;&#183;&#353;&#363;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_804.htm">Strong's 804: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ashshur</span><br /><br /><span class="word">brought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
