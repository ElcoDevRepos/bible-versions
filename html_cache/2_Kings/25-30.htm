After being taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar, Jehoiachin was imprisoned for 37 years. The king referred to here is Evil-Merodach, Nebuchadnezzar's successor, who released Jehoiachin from prison and treated him with favor. This act of kindness can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to preserve a remnant of David's line, as Jehoiachin was a descendant of David. The daily provision symbolizes God's ongoing care and faithfulness to His covenant people, even in exile. This provision also reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of providing for deposed royalty, ensuring their sustenance and dignity.<p><b>for the rest of his life</b><br>Jehoiachin's release and the provision for the rest of his life signify a restoration of dignity and hope. This phrase underscores the permanence of the king's decree, ensuring Jehoiachin's well-being until his death. Historically, this act of mercy by Evil-Merodach may have been politically motivated, as maintaining good relations with former rulers could stabilize his reign. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of God's grace and the hope of restoration, even after judgment and exile. This enduring provision can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers eternal sustenance and life to those who are spiritually captive. The continuity of Jehoiachin's line is significant, as it leads to the genealogy of Jesus Christ, fulfilling the promise of a Davidic king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiachin.htm">Jehoiachin</a></b><br>The former king of Judah who was taken captive by the Babylonians.

There would be nothing strange in this, considering his age and his thirty-seven years of imprisonment.<p>The writer evidently dwells with pleasure on this faint gleam of light amid the darkness of the exile. It was a kind of foreshadowing of the pity which afterwards was to be extended to the captive people, when the divine purpose had been achieved, and the exile had done its work of chastisement and purification. (Comp, <a href="/psalms/106-46.htm" title="He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.">Psalm 106:46</a>; <a href="/ezra/9-9.htm" title="For we were slaves; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.">Ezra 9:9</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-2.htm" title="Why the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart.

But it is quite as likely to have been a money payment. The word translated by "allowance" - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5bb;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> - does not point necessarily to food. It is a "portion' of any kind. <span class="cmt_word">Given him of the king</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, out of the privy purse, by the king's command - <span class="cmt_word">a daily rate for every day</span> - or, a c<span class="accented">ertain amount day by</span> day - <span class="cmt_word">all the days of his life</span> (see the comment on the preceding verse). Beth the privileges accorded to Jehoiachin, his sustenance at the king's table, and his allowance, whether in money or in kind, continued to the day of his death. Neither of them was ever revoked or forfeited. Thus this last representative of the Davidic monarchy, after thirty-six years of chastisement, experienced a happy change of circumstances, and died in peace and comfort. Probably, as Keil says, "this event was intended as a comforting sign to the whole of the captive people, that the Lord would one day put an end to their banishment, if they would acknowledge that it was a well-merited punishment for their sins that they had been driven away from before his face, and would turn again to the Lord their God with all their heart." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/25-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
