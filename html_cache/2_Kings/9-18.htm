This scene takes place during a time of political upheaval in Israel. Jehu, a commander in the army of Israel, has been anointed by a prophet to become king and to execute judgment on the house of Ahab. The horseman represents the current king's attempt to maintain control and gather intelligence on Jehu's intentions.<p><b>and said, &#8220;This is what the king asks: &#8216;Have you come in peace?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The question "Have you come in peace?" reflects the king's concern about Jehu's intentions. In the context of ancient Israel, peace (shalom) was not just the absence of conflict but also the presence of justice and right relationships. The king's inquiry indicates a desire to know whether Jehu's approach is hostile or friendly. This question is significant in the biblical narrative, as it often precedes moments of divine intervention or judgment.<p><b>&#8220;What do you know about peace?&#8221; Jehu replied.</b><br>Jehu's response is confrontational and dismissive, suggesting that the current regime, represented by the king, lacks true understanding or practice of peace. This can be seen as a critique of the moral and spiritual state of Israel under Ahab's lineage. Jehu's mission, as ordained by God through the prophet Elisha, is to bring judgment and restore righteousness, which he implies the current leadership has failed to uphold.<p><b>&#8220;Fall in behind me.&#8221;</b><br>Jehu's command to the horseman to "fall in behind me" signifies a shift in allegiance. It indicates Jehu's authority and the inevitability of his mission. This phrase can be seen as a call to join the new order that Jehu is establishing, one that aligns with God's will. It also foreshadows the broader acceptance and support Jehu will receive as he fulfills his divinely appointed task.<p><b>And the watchman reported, &#8220;The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.&#8221;</b><br>The watchman's report highlights the tension and uncertainty of the situation. The fact that the messenger does not return suggests that Jehu's influence is compelling and that his mission is gaining momentum. This moment underscores the theme of divine providence and the unstoppable nature of God's plans. It also reflects the fear and confusion within the current regime as they witness the unfolding of events beyond their control.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>Anointed by God to be king over Israel, Jehu is a central figure in this passage.

"What does it matter to such a one as thee, a mere common man, whether my tidings are peaceful or the contrary? I shall not tell thee my errand. Turn and follow in my train." The messenger had no choice but to obey. An attempt at flight would have led to his being seized or slain. <span class="cmt_word">And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.</span> The watchman evidently thought his not returning suspicious, and reported it at once.
