Building altars in the temple, the sacred space dedicated to Yahweh, was an act of desecration. This reflects the syncretism prevalent during his reign, where pagan practices were incorporated into the worship of Yahweh. Historically, Manasseh's reign is noted for its idolatry and apostasy, as he introduced foreign religious practices into Judah, leading the nation away from covenant faithfulness.<p><b>of which the LORD had said</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and the specific instructions given by God regarding the temple. The temple was not just a building but a symbol of God's covenant with Israel. The LORD's words are a reminder of the divine mandate and the sacredness of the temple as the dwelling place of God's presence among His people.<p><b>&#8220;In Jerusalem I will put My Name.&#8221;</b><br>This statement highlights Jerusalem's unique status as the chosen city where God established His presence. The phrase "put My Name" signifies God's ownership, blessing, and the centrality of Jerusalem in His redemptive plan. It connects to <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>, where God instructs Israel to seek the place He will choose to put His Name. This choice of Jerusalem as the spiritual center is fulfilled in the Davidic covenant and ultimately points to the coming of Jesus Christ, who would be crucified and resurrected in this city, further establishing it as the focal point of God's salvific work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned for 55 years and was known for his idolatrous practices, including building altars to false gods in the temple of the LORD.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was the central place of worship for the Israelites and where God's presence was said to dwell.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, chosen by God as the place where His name would reside, signifying His presence and covenant with His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/altars.htm">Altars</a></b><br>Structures built for the purpose of offering sacrifices.
