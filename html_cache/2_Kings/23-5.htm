The idolatrous priests, or "chem&#257;rim," were those who led the people in worship of false gods. This action reflects Josiah's commitment to the covenantal laws found in Deuteronomy, which strictly prohibited idolatry. His actions were in line with the reforms of previous kings like Hezekiah, who also sought to purify worship in Judah.<p><b>ordained by the kings of Judah</b><br>Previous kings, particularly Manasseh and Amon, had established and supported these priests, leading the nation into idolatry. This highlights the failure of Judah's leadership to uphold the worship of Yahweh. Josiah's reforms were a reversal of these policies, aiming to restore true worship as prescribed in the Law of Moses.<p><b>to burn incense on the high places of the cities of Judah</b><br>High places were local shrines often situated on elevated sites, where people worshiped various deities. Although some high places were initially used for Yahweh worship, they became centers for idolatry. Josiah's destruction of these sites was a fulfillment of Deuteronomic law, which commanded the centralization of worship in Jerusalem.<p><b>and in the places all around Jerusalem</b><br>This indicates the widespread nature of idolatry, even in the vicinity of the holy city. The proximity to Jerusalem underscores the extent of religious corruption. Josiah's reforms were comprehensive, targeting both rural and urban centers to ensure the eradication of idolatry.<p><b>those who had burned incense to Baal</b><br>Baal worship was one of the most pervasive forms of idolatry in ancient Israel and Judah. Baal was a Canaanite deity associated with fertility and storms. The worship of Baal was explicitly condemned in the Hebrew Scriptures, and Josiah's actions were a direct confrontation against this false worship.<p><b>to the sun and moon</b><br>Worship of celestial bodies was common in the ancient Near East. The sun and moon were often deified and worshiped as powerful entities. This practice was contrary to the worship of Yahweh, who created the heavenly bodies. Josiah's reforms sought to eliminate these pagan practices, aligning with the biblical mandate to worship the Creator rather than the creation.<p><b>to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven</b><br>This phrase encompasses the worship of stars and other celestial phenomena, which was prevalent in surrounding cultures. Such practices were forbidden in the Mosaic Law, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>. Josiah's actions were a return to monotheism, emphasizing the worship of Yahweh alone. This reform can be seen as a type of Christ, who also cleansed the temple and called for true worship in spirit and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore the worship of Yahweh and eliminate idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatrous_priests.htm">Idolatrous Priests</a></b><br>These were priests appointed by previous kings of Judah to conduct worship and sacrifices to false gods.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places.htm">High Places</a></b><br>Elevated sites where unauthorized worship and sacrifices to idols were conducted.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal.htm">Baal</a></b><br>A Canaanite deity often associated with fertility and weather, worshiped by many in ancient Israel and Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_bodies.htm">Heavenly Bodies</a></b><br>The sun, moon, and constellations, which were objects of worship contrary to the worship of Yahweh.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_purity_in_worship.htm">Commitment to Purity in Worship</a></b><br>Josiah's actions remind us of the importance of maintaining purity in our worship practices, ensuring they align with biblical teachings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_leadership.htm">Courage in Leadership</a></b><br>Josiah demonstrated courage by going against the established norms and practices of his predecessors, a reminder for us to stand firm in our convictions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_syncretism.htm">The Danger of Syncretism</a></b><br>The blending of true worship with idolatrous practices is a recurring theme in Israel's history, warning us against compromising our faith with worldly influences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_scripture_in_reform.htm">The Role of Scripture in Reform</a></b><br>Josiah's reforms were driven by the rediscovery of the Book of the Law, highlighting the transformative power of Scripture in guiding our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_call_to_holiness.htm">God's Call to Holiness</a></b><br>The elimination of idolatry underscores God's call for His people to be holy and set apart, a principle that remains relevant for believers today.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_23_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 23:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_23_5_Remove_idolatry_s_impact.htm">How does 2 Kings 23:5 demonstrate the importance of removing idolatry from our lives?

The phrase highlights decisive action: he &#8220;did away,&#8221; not merely re-organized or delayed. Josiah treats idolatry the way God told Israel to treat it from the start&#8212;eradicate it (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12-17</a>). His zeal fulfills earlier prophecy that a king from David&#8217;s line would break down pagan altars (<a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the idolatrous priests</b><p>These &#8220;chem&#257;r&#238;m&#8221; were not Levites faithfully serving in the temple; they were self-styled clergy leading the people astray (<a href="/zephaniah/1-4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4</a>; <a href="/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>). By dismissing them, Josiah obeys God&#8217;s command that only Aaron&#8217;s descendants serve at the altar (<a href="/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>). Removal protects both worship and nation: false priests always produce false living (<a href="/jeremiah/23-13.htm">Jeremiah 23:13-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>ordained by the kings of Judah</b><p>Past kings&#8212;especially Manasseh&#8212;had sanctioned this priesthood (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3-5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-5.htm">2 Chronicles 33:5</a>). Royal endorsement gave sin official status. Josiah reverses that precedent, illustrating that earthly authority must submit to heavenly authority (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>). His reform reminds leaders today that policy never overrules Scripture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to burn incense on the high places of the cities of Judah</b><p>Incense symbolized prayer and worship (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). Offering it on &#8220;high places&#8221;&#8212;unsanctioned hilltop shrines&#8212;was a direct violation of God&#8217;s command to bring sacrifices only to the chosen place (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-13</a>). What looked &#8220;spiritual&#8221; was actually rebellion dressed in tradition (<a href="/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2</a>). Josiah abolishes the practice rather than adapting it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in the places all around Jerusalem</b><p>Idolatry had crept to the very doorstep of the temple (<a href="/jeremiah/19-4.htm">Jeremiah 19:4-5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>). Josiah&#8217;s purge is comprehensive; he refuses a geographical double standard&#8212;no &#8220;safe zones&#8221; for sin. Holiness must reach the suburbs as well as the sanctuary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>those who had burned incense to Baal</b><p>Baal worship blended sexual immorality, child sacrifice, and claims of fertility (<a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>; 19:5). Elijah had exposed it a century earlier (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>), yet it resurged. Josiah&#8217;s action shows God&#8217;s patience has limits; repeated warnings unanswered lead to judgment (<a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the sun and moon</b><p>Astral worship captivated many ancient peoples (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>; <a href="/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26-28</a>).

Only occurring besides in <a href="/zephaniah/1-4.htm" title="I will also stretch out my hand on Judah, and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;">Zephaniah 1:4</a>. Here, as in the passage of Hosea, the word denotes the unlawful priests of Jehovah, as contrasted with those of the Baal, mentioned in the next place. Whether the term really means <span class= "ital">black-robed</span>, as Kimchi explains, is questionable. Priests used to wear <span class= "ital">white</span> throughout the ancient world, except on certain special occasions. Gesenius derives it from a root meaning <span class= "ital">black</span>, but explains, <span class= "ital">one clad in black, i.e., a mourner, an ascetic</span>, and so a <span class= "ital">priest</span>. Perhaps the true derivation is from another root, meaning to <span class= "ital">weave: weaver of spells</span> or <span class= "ital">charms</span>; as magic was an invariable concomitant of false worship. (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/17-17.htm" title="And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2Kings 17:17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm" title="And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he worked much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2Kings 21:6</a>.) It is a regular word for priest in Syriac (ch-mra; <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>; and the Ep. to the Heb., <span class= "ital">passim</span>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he put down the idolatrous priests</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the chemarim</span>. The same word is used of idolatrous priests in <a href="/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/1-4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4</a>. It is best connected with the Arabic root <span class="accented">chamar</span>, <span class="accented">colere deum</span>, and with the Syriac <span class="accented">cumro</span>, "priest" or "sacrificer." The Syrian priests were probably so called at the time, and the Hebrews took the word, and applied it to all false priests or idolatrous priests, reserving their <span class="accented">own cohanim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) for true Jehovistic priests only. <span class="cmt_word">Whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem.</span> This practice had not been mentioned previously, and can scarcely have belonged to the earlier kingdom of Judah, when "<span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">people"</span> (as we are told so often) "worshipped and burnt incense in the high places." But it is quite in harmony with the other doings of Manasseh and Amen, that, when they re-established the high places (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3, 21</a>), they should have followed the custom of the Israelite monarchs at Dan and Bethel (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-32</a>), and have "ordained priests" to conduct the worship at them. <span class="cmt_word">Them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon</span> (on the Baal-worship of Manasseh and Amen, see <a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>; on the sun-worship, compare below, ver. 11; the moon-worship was probably a form of the worship of Astarte), <span class="cmt_word">and to the planets</span>; rather, to the twelve signs. The constellations or signs of the zodiac are, no doubt, intended (comp. <a href="/job/38-32.htm">Job 38:32</a>, where the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> may be regarded as a mere variant form of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> of this passage). The proper meaning of the term is "mansions;" or "houses," the zodiacal signs being regarded as the "mansions of the sun" by the Babylonians (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. p. 419). <span class="cmt_word">And to all the host of heaven</span> (see the comment on 2 Kings 21:3). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/23-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[Josiah] also did away with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hi&#353;&#183;b&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
