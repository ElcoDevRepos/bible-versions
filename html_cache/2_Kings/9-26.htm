Naboth owned a vineyard that King Ahab desired. When Naboth refused to sell it, Queen Jezebel orchestrated false charges against him, leading to his execution. The mention of "yesterday" emphasizes the immediacy and freshness of the crime in God's eyes, even though it occurred years earlier. This highlights God's omniscience and His perfect justice, as He remembers and avenges innocent blood. The inclusion of Naboth's sons indicates that Jezebel's plot was thorough, eliminating any heirs to the vineyard, which underscores the depth of the injustice.<p><b>so will I repay you on this plot of ground, declares the LORD</b><br>This is a direct fulfillment of the prophecy given by Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>, where God declared that Ahab's blood would be shed in the same place where Naboth's blood was spilled. The phrase "on this plot of ground" signifies divine retribution and justice, as the very land that was unjustly taken becomes the site of judgment. This reflects the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>) and serves as a warning against the abuse of power and injustice.<p><b>Now then, according to the word of the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and certainty of God's word. The events unfolding are not random but are the direct result of divine prophecy and judgment. It highlights the reliability of God's promises and the inevitability of His justice. This also serves as a reminder of the prophetic role in Israel, where prophets were the mouthpiece of God, delivering His messages and judgments.<p><b>pick him up and throw him on the plot of ground</b><br>This command is given to Jehu, who was anointed king to execute judgment on the house of Ahab. The act of throwing the body on Naboth's plot is symbolic, serving as a public demonstration of God's justice. It fulfills the prophecy and serves as a visible reminder to the people of Israel of the consequences of sin and the certainty of divine retribution. This action also prefigures the ultimate justice that will be executed by Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead (<a href="/2_timothy/4.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naboth.htm">Naboth</a></b><br>A righteous man who owned a vineyard coveted by King Ahab.

The inappropriateness of such an expression in the mouth of the Deity is obvious; but that only shows how completely the original meaning of the formula was forgotten in everyday usage.<p><span class= "bld">Yesterday.</span>--So that Ahab seized the vineyard the day after the murder of Naboth, a detail not exactly specified in <a href="/1_kings/21-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.">1Kings 21:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The blood.</span>--The plural (margin) implies <span class= "ital">death by violence</span> (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm" title="And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.">Genesis 4:10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And the blood of his sons.</span>--The murder of the sons of Naboth is neither stated nor implied in 1 Kings 21, an omission which has needlessly troubled the minds of commentators. As to the fact, it would be quite in accordance with ancient practice to slay the sons of one accused of blasphemy along with their father (comp. <a href="/context/joshua/7-24.htm" title="And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor.">Joshua 7:24-25</a>); and the crafty Jezebel would not be likely to spare persons whose wrongs might one day prove dangerous. The difference in the two narratives is accounted for by the circumstance that the present is the <span class= "ital">exact version</span> of an eye-witness, viz., Jehu himself, while the former was probably derived from a less direct source.<p><span class= "bld">Saith the Lord.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">is the thing uttered of Jehovah.</span> This phrase, which is uncommon except in the writings of the prophets, and the word rendered "burden" in the last verse, which also belongs to prophetic terminology, together establish the historical authenticity of the short oracle of Elijah, recorded in this verse. Its brevity and the solemnity with which it was pronounced would, we may be sure, stamp it ineffaceably upon the memory of those who heard it. (Comp. <a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm" title="Why the LORD God of Israel said, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD said, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.">1Samuel 2:30</a>; and <a href="/2_kings/19-33.htm" title="By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, said the LORD.">2Kings 19:33</a>, <span class= "ital">infra</span>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth</span> (comp. <a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>, where the same idea of retribution is expressed, though in different words). Jehu, after the lapse of fourteen or fifteen years, naturally had forgotten the exact words used. <span class="cmt_word">And the blood of his sons.</span> The execution of Naboth's sons had not been mentioned previously; but, under the rude jurisprudence of the age (<a href="/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>), sons were usually slain with their fathers. And, unless they had been removed, Ahab could not have inherited the vineyard. <span class="cmt_word">Saith the Lord; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the Lord.</span> This was the gist of the prophecy, which ran as follows: "In <span class="accented">the place</span> where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine." <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the Lord.</span> The evil prophesied against Ahab had been formally and expressly deferred to his son's days on Ahab's repentance (cf. <a href="/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/9-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8216;As surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as I saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the blood</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#601;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1818.htm">Strong's 1818: </a> </span><span class="str2">Blood, of man, an animal, the juice of the grape, bloodshed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Naboth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5022.htm">Strong's 5022: </a> </span><span class="str2">Naboth -- a Jezreelite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the blood</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#601;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1818.htm">Strong's 1818: </a> </span><span class="str2">Blood, of man, an animal, the juice of the grape, bloodshed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1436;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
