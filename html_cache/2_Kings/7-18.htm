The "man of God" refers to Elisha, a prominent prophet in Israel who succeeded Elijah. This fulfillment underscores the divine authority behind prophetic messages and serves as a testament to God's sovereignty and faithfulness. It also reflects the biblical theme that God's promises, whether of judgment or blessing, are certain and will come to pass.<p><b>&#8220;About this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria:</b><br>The phrase "about this time tomorrow" indicates the immediacy and precision of the prophecy. The "gate of Samaria" was a central place for commerce and legal matters in the city, serving as a marketplace and a location for public announcements. Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, and during this time, it was under siege by the Arameans, leading to severe famine. The prophecy's setting at the city gate highlights the public nature of the fulfillment, ensuring that it would be witnessed by many.<p><b>two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel:</b><br>A "seah" is a unit of dry measure, roughly equivalent to about 7-9 liters or 1.5-2 gallons. Barley was a staple grain, often considered less valuable than wheat, and used primarily for feeding animals and the poor. The mention of "two seahs of barley for a shekel" indicates a dramatic reversal of the famine conditions, as food would become abundant and affordable. A "shekel" was a standard unit of currency, and this price suggests a return to normalcy and economic stability.<p><b>and a seah of fine flour will sell for a shekel.&#8221;</b><br>"Fine flour" was a more refined and desirable product than barley, used for making bread and other baked goods. The prophecy that a "seah of fine flour will sell for a shekel" further emphasizes the miraculous nature of the provision, as fine flour would typically be more expensive. This prediction of economic recovery and abundance serves as a sign of God's intervention and blessing, contrasting sharply with the dire circumstances of the siege. The fulfillment of this prophecy demonstrates God's power to provide and His ability to change situations swiftly and unexpectedly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a
