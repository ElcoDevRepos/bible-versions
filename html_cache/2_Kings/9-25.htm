The reason for the order follows. <span class="cmt_word">For remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the Lord laid this burden upon him.</span> The LXX. have <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, "I remember;" but the Hebrew text is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5db;&#x5e8;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5db;&#x5e8;</span> "Remember" (imperative mood) is the correct translation. Jehu recalls his captain's recollection to an occurrence which was deeply impressed upon his own. "When thou and I rode together after Ahab" probably means "when we two stood behind Ahab in his chariot." The Assyrian sculptures usually represent the monarch as attended by two body-guards, who ride in the same chariot with him, standing up behind him, and often interposing their shields to protect his person. In this near proximity Jehu and Bidkar would hear any speech which was addressed to Ahab. By a "burden" is meant a sentence of punishment (comp. <a href="/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; etc.; <a href="/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/9-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And [Jehu] said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
