The priests were instructed to collect funds from their respective constituencies, which refers to the people they served. This reflects the decentralized nature of ancient Israelite society, where local communities were responsible for supporting religious institutions. The priests acted as intermediaries between the people and God, and their role in collecting funds underscores their leadership and responsibility in maintaining the temple. This system of collection can be compared to the tithes and offerings mentioned in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>, where the people are encouraged to bring their tithes into the storehouse.<p><b>and let it be used to repair any damage found in the temple.</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was central to Israelite worship and was originally built by King Solomon. Over time, due to neglect and possibly the influence of idolatrous practices introduced by previous kings, the temple had fallen into disrepair. The directive to use the funds specifically for repairs highlights the importance of maintaining the sanctity and functionality of the temple as a place of worship. This restoration effort can be seen as a physical manifestation of spiritual renewal, paralleling the reforms of other kings like Hezekiah and Josiah, who also sought to restore proper worship practices. The emphasis on repairing the temple can be seen as a type of Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), symbolizing the restoration and renewal He brings to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated the repair of the temple.

Together these themes call believers in every age to give faithfully, manage honestly, and prize the glory of God above personal comfort.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Every man of his acquaintance.</span>--See <a href="/2_chronicles/24-5.htm" title="And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you hasten the matter. However, the Levites hastened it not.">2Chronicles 24:5</a>. From that passage it is evident that the chronicler understood that the priests were required to collect such moneys, each in his own city and district, year by year. Our text, taken alone, would seem to imply that persons going to the Temple to have the value of vows estimated, or to make free-will offerings, resorted to the priests whom they knew. (The word rendered "acquaintance" only occurs in this account.)<p><span class= "bld">The breaches of the house.</span>--The dilapidations of the Temple were serious, not because of its age--it had only stood about 130 years--but owing to the wanton attacks of Athaliah and her sons (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/24-7.htm" title="For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow on Baalim.">2Chronicles 24:7</a>), who had, moreover, diverted the revenues of the sanctuary to the support of the Baalworship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance.</span> The money was to be gathered of "all Israel," out of all "the cities of Judah" (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-5.htm">2 Chronicles 24:5</a>). The priests of each locality were to be the collectors, and would therefore gather "of their acquaintance." As we cannot suppose that very much would accrue from either the first or second source, since a census was rarely taken, and personal vows were not very common, we must regard the command of Joash as, in the main, the authorization of a general collection throughout the kingdom of voluntary contributions towards the temple repairs, and so as analogous to the "letters" which our own sovereigns, or archbishops, issue from time to time for collections in churches for special objects. <span class="cmt_word">And let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.</span> The "breaches," or dilapidations, may have been caused, partly by the neglect of necessary repairs during the reigns of Jehoram, Ahaziah, and Athaliah; but they were mainly the result of the willful violence of Athaliah (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>).
