Positioned on walls or towers, watchmen were responsible for observing and reporting any approaching threats or significant events. This phrase indicates a repeated action, suggesting the watchman is diligently performing his duty, highlighting the urgency and importance of the situation. The watchman's role is often symbolic in Scripture, representing spiritual vigilance and the need for alertness (<a href="/ezekiel/33-6.htm">Ezekiel 33:6</a>).<p><b>He reached them, but he is not coming back.</b><br>This phrase indicates a deviation from expected behavior, suggesting something unusual or significant has occurred. The context here is Jehu's mission to execute judgment on the house of Ahab, as commanded by God through the prophet Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6-10</a>). The failure to return implies a decisive action or confrontation, aligning with Jehu's divinely appointed task to eradicate Baal worship and fulfill the prophecy against Ahab's lineage (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>).<p><b>And the charioteer is driving like Jehu son of Nimshi&#8212;</b><br>Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat and grandson of Nimshi, was known for his aggressive and zealous nature. His driving style becomes a recognizable trait, indicating his fervor and determination. Jehu's lineage is significant as it connects him to the fulfillment of God's judgment against the house of Ahab. His actions are a direct response to the prophetic word given by Elijah and later confirmed by Elisha, showcasing the sovereignty of God in using individuals to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>he is driving like a madman!&#8221;</b><br>The description of Jehu's driving as "like a madman" underscores his intense zeal and urgency. This behavior reflects his commitment to carrying out God's judgment swiftly and without hesitation. In a broader biblical context, Jehu's zeal can be seen as a type of Christ's righteous indignation against sin, though Jehu's methods and motivations were not always pure. His actions serve as a reminder of the seriousness of God's judgment and the need for obedience to His commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>Son of Nimshi, anointed by God through the prophet Elisha to become king of Israel.

Repetition underlines something extraordinary: ordinary protocol is breaking down.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereign timetable is at work.
