In biblical times, acts of faith often required a personal and intimate setting, away from public scrutiny. This mirrors Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a> about praying in private. The act of going inside signifies a step of faith and trust in God's provision.<p><b>shut the door behind you and your sons</b><br>Shutting the door symbolizes a separation from doubt and external influences. It reflects a focus on God's miraculous provision without distraction. This act of closing the door is reminiscent of Noah's ark, where God shut the door to protect Noah's family (<a href="/genesis/7-16.htm">Genesis 7:16</a>). It also highlights the importance of family unity in faith, as the sons are included in witnessing the miracle.<p><b>and pour oil into all these jars</b><br>The pouring of oil is a significant act of faith, as oil in the Bible often symbolizes the Holy Spirit, anointing, and blessing (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). The widow's obedience to pour oil into the jars reflects her trust in God's provision, similar to the faith shown by the widow of Zarephath in <a href="/1_kings/17-14.htm">1 Kings 17:14-16</a>. The act of pouring also signifies the abundance of God's blessings, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>.<p><b>setting the full ones aside</b><br>This phrase indicates preparation for future provision and stewardship. The act of setting aside the full jars shows anticipation of God's continued blessing and the importance of managing resources wisely. It reflects the principle of storing up treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>) and being prepared for God's future plans. The full jars symbolize the overflowing nature of God's provision, as seen in the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/john/6-12.htm">John 6:12-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah.

By closing the door, the widow shuts out skeptical neighbors and worldly noise, much like Jesus instructs, &#8220;when you pray, go into your inner room, shut your door&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The closed door makes the moment a family lesson: her sons watch God supply what creditors threatened to take (<a href="/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Miracles often unfold away from crowds: Elisha later raises the Shunammite&#8217;s child behind a closed door (<a href="/2_kings/4-33.htm">2 Kings 4:33</a>), Peter does the same with Dorcas (<a href="/acts/9-40.htm">Acts 9:40</a>), and Jesus dismisses scoffers before raising Jairus&#8217;s daughter (<a href="/mark/5-40.htm">Mark 5:40-41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pour oil into all these jars</b><p>&#8226; Action must match expectation.
