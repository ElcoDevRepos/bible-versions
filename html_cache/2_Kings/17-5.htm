This invasion marks a significant moment in Israel's history, as it represents the culmination of a series of Assyrian campaigns against the Northern Kingdom. The "whole land" refers to the territory of Israel, indicating a comprehensive military campaign. This invasion was a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Hosea and Amos, who had foretold the consequences of Israel's persistent idolatry and disobedience to God.<p><b>marched up to Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, established by King Omri. It was strategically located on a hill, making it a formidable fortress. The phrase "marched up" suggests a deliberate and determined military advance. Samaria's significance is underscored by its repeated mention in the prophetic literature as a center of idolatry and corruption. The city's fall would symbolize the collapse of the Northern Kingdom.<p><b>and besieged it for three years</b><br>The siege of Samaria lasted from 725 to 722 BC, a prolonged period that indicates the city's initial resilience. A siege in ancient times involved surrounding a city to cut off supplies and force surrender. This three-year siege reflects the severity of the Assyrian campaign and the desperation of Samaria's inhabitants. The number three often symbolizes completeness in the Bible, suggesting the totality of God's judgment on Israel.

Prophets singled it out for idolatry (<a href="/hosea/13-16.htm">Hosea 13:16</a>; <a href="/micah/1-6.htm">Micah 1:6</a>). By heading straight for the capital, Assyria aimed at the heart, showing that no fortress, however impressive, could shield disobedience from divine judgment (<a href="/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8-10</a>).<p>- The march also fulfilled specific prophecy: <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm">Isaiah 7:8-9</a> had warned that if Ephraim (Israel) did not stand by faith, its capital would fall.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>besieged it for three years</b><p>- &#8220;and besieged it for three years.&#8221; A prolonged siege (c. 725-722 BC) mirrors the covenant curse in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-52.htm">Deuteronomy 28:52</a>: &#8220;They will besiege you in all your gates&#8230;&#8221;<p>- Three years highlights both the severity of divine discipline and God&#8217;s patience&#8212;ample time remained for last-minute repentance, yet the nation persisted in rebellion (<a href="/2_kings/17-14.htm">2 Kings 17:14-17</a>).<p>- The length also shows Assyria&#8217;s relentless power; earlier they had already deported parts of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). Now the capital itself was starved into surrender, a grim preview of the later Babylonian siege of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1-2</a>).<p>- When the city finally fell (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>), the Northern Kingdom ceased to exist, confirming <a href="/hosea/8-8.htm">Hosea 8:8</a>: &#8220;Israel is swallowed up; now they are among the nations&#8230;&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5</a> records the unstoppable advance of Assyria as God&#8217;s chosen instrument to judge Israel&#8217;s persistent idolatry.
