Led by the faithful priest Jehoiada, military leaders, temple guards, and the entire populace unite to escort the rightful king from the sanctuary to the palace. Every group plays its part under God&#8217;s sovereign hand, restoring David&#8217;s line and national stability. The verse celebrates covenant faithfulness, the harmony of spiritual and civil authority, and points ahead to the perfect reign of the greater Son of David.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">And he took the rulers . . . the land.</span>--Jehoiada now arranges a procession to escort the king in triumph from the Temple to the palace.<p><span class= "bld">The rulers . . . guard.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the captains of the hundreds</span> (the centurions) <span class= "ital">and the Carians and the Couriers</span>; or, as Thenius prefers, <span class= "ital">the lictors and the satellites</span>.<p><span class= "bld">They brought down the king from the house of the Lord.</span>--<span class= "ital">Down</span> from the Temple to the bridge connecting Moriah with Zion.<p><span class= "bld">And came by the way . . . king's house.</span>--Rather, and entered the king's house by way of the gate of the Couriers.
