His reign is noted for its instability and idolatry, which ultimately led to the weakening of the northern kingdom. Pekah's rule was marked by political alliances and conflicts, including his opposition to the Assyrian empire. His reign is a continuation of the spiritual decline that characterized the northern kingdom after the division of Israel.<p><b>Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria</b><br>Tiglath-pileser III was a powerful and expansionist ruler of Assyria, reigning from 745 to 727 BC. He is known for his military campaigns and administrative reforms that strengthened Assyria's control over its territories. His involvement in Israel's affairs marks a significant moment in the history of the region, as Assyria's influence began to dominate the political landscape. This event is part of the larger narrative of Assyria's rise to power and its impact on the nations of the ancient Near East.<p><b>came and captured Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee</b><br>These locations represent key cities and regions in the northern kingdom of Israel. Ijon and Abel-beth-maacah were situated in the northernmost part of Israel, near the border with Aram (Syria). Janoah, Kedesh, and Hazor were significant cities in the region of Naphtali. Gilead was a region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and rugged terrain. Galilee, a fertile and strategically important area, would later become significant in the New Testament as the region where Jesus conducted much of His ministry. The capture of these areas by Assyria signifies the beginning of the end for the northern kingdom, as it loses its territorial integrity and independence.<p><b>including all the land of Naphtali</b><br>Naphtali was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, located in the northern part of the kingdom. The tribe's territory was known for its beauty and fertility, as well as its strategic importance. The loss of Naphtali to Assyria was a devastating blow to Israel, both economically and militarily. This event fulfills earlier warnings given by prophets about the consequences of Israel's disobedience and idolatry.<p><b>and he took the people as captives to Assyria</b><br>The deportation of the Israelites to Assyria was a common practice by the Assyrians to prevent rebellion and assimilate conquered peoples. This event marks the beginning of the exile for the northern kingdom, a pivotal moment in Israel's history. The loss of identity and homeland would have profound spiritual and cultural implications for the Israelites. This captivity is a precursor to the later Babylonian exile of Judah and serves as a backdrop for the prophetic messages of hope and restoration found in the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pekah.htm">Pekah</a></b><br>King of Israel during the time of the Assyrian invasion.

God used a foreign king to strip Israel of its northern defenses, occupy Naphtali&#8217;s territory, and deport many Israelites, fulfilling warnings of exile for persistent idolatry. The verse stands as a sober reminder that the Lord keeps His word&#8212;both in judgment and, ultimately, in mercy&#8212;calling His people to faithful obedience while assuring that His sovereign purposes can never be thwarted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the days of Pekah Feng of Israel came Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria.</span> Tiglath-pileser's records are not in the shape of annals, and are, moreover, in a very mutilated condition. He does not date events, like most Assyrian kings, by his regal years. His first expedition into Syria is thought, however, to have been in his third year, <span class="date">B.C. 743</span>, but there is no evidence that, on this occasion, he proceeded further south than Damascus, where he took tribute from Rezin. Some years after this - <span class="date">B.C. 738</span>, according to Mr. G. Smith - he penetrated to Palestine, where his chief enemy was Azariah King of Judah, who had united under his sway most of the tribes as far as Hamath. After chastising Azariah, he extended his dominion over most of the neighboring states and kingdoms; and it was at this time that (as related in ver. 19) he took tribute from Menahem. Subsequently (about <span class="date">B.C. 734</span>) he made an expedition for the purpose of conquest, which receives very scant notice, in one inscription only. This is probably the expedition of the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">And took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah.</span> These were places in the extreme north of the Israelite territory, in the vicinity of the Lake Merem, such as would naturally be among the first to fall before an Assyrian invader (on their exact position, see the comment on 1 Kings 15:20). <span class="cmt_word">And Janoah.</span> Janoah is now generally regarded as identical with the modern <span class="accented">Hunin</span>, a village close by "an ancient fortress of great strength" (Robinson, 'Later Researches,' p. 371), in the hill country northwest of Merom. It is in a direct line between Abel-beth-maa-chah (<span class="accented">Abil</span>) and Kedesh (<span class="accented">Cades</span>), as we should expect from the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">And Kedesh, and Hazor</span>. Kedesh is beyond all doubt the "Kedes" or "Cades," of today - an important site in the same mountain district, rather more than six miles south of Hunin, and four from the "waters of Merom" (see Robinson, 'Later Researches,' pp. 366, 367). Hazer was in the near neighborhood of Kedesh, towards the south probably. The exact position is disputed. Robinson's arguments in favor of El-Khu reibch are weighty; but the engineers employed by the Palestine Exploration Fund regard Khurbat-Harrah, between Kedesh and the Lake Merom, as a still more probable situation. <span class="cmt_word">And Gilead.</span> "Gilead," in this connection, can scarcely be "the whole of the land to the east of the Jordan" (Keil, Bahr) - the territory of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh, not of Naphtali. It is more likely to be a small district near Merom, perhaps the eastern coast of the lake (Gesenius), which was afterwards a part of Gaulouitis. The LXX., instead of <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3b4;</span>, have <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And Galilee</span>; Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (see the comment on 1 Kings 9:11, p. 190). The inscription of Tiglath-pileser, which appears to allude to this expedition, mentions "Galhi," and "Abel" (probably Abel-beth-maachah) as conquered at this time, and "added to Assyria." The places were, it says, on the border of the land of Beth-Omri (Samaria) (see the 'Eponym Canon,' p. 123, lines 6, 7). <span class="cmt_word">And carried them captive to Assyria.</span> Deportation of captives was largely practiced by Tiglath-pileser, as appears from the 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 118-120, and 122. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/15-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1461;&#1438;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#238;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
