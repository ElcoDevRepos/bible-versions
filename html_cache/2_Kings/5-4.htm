But while he raged against the priests in their presence in the house of the LORD before the altar of incense, leprosy broke out on his forehead. / When Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned to him and saw his leprous forehead, they rushed him out. Indeed, he himself hurried to get out, because the LORD had afflicted him. / So King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He lived in isolation, leprous and cut off from the house of the LORD, while his son Jotham had charge of the royal palace and governed the people of the land.</div><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a name="tsk" id="tsk"><div class="vheading">Treasury of Scripture</div><p class="tsk2">And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.</p><p class="hdg">and told his lord</p><p class="tskverse"><b><a href="/2_kings/7-9.htm">2 Kings 7:9-11</a></b></br> Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day <i>is</i> a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household&#8230; </p><p class="tskverse"><b><a href="/mark/5-19.htm">Mark 5:19</a></b></br> Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.</p><p class="tskverse"><b><a href="/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9,10</a></b></br> Now when <i>Jesus</i> was risen early the first <i>day</i> of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils&#8230; </p><div class="vheading">Jump to Previous</div><a href="/2_kings/5-2.htm">Damsel</a> <a href="/2_kings/4-7.htm">Declareth</a> <a href="/2_kings/5-2.htm">Girl</a> <a href="/2_kings/5-2.htm">Israel</a> <a href="/2_kings/5-2.htm">Maid</a> <a href="/2_kings/5-2.htm">Maiden</a> <a href="/2_kings/5-3.htm">Master</a> <a href="/2_kings/5-2.htm">Naaman</a> <a href="/2_kings/5-1.htm">Na'aman</a> <a href="/1_kings/18-10.htm">Someone</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="/matthew/9-24.htm">Damsel</a> <a href="/2_kings/6-12.htm">Declareth</a> <a href="/esther/2-4.htm">Girl</a> <a href="/2_kings/5-5.htm">Israel</a> <a href="/esther/2-7.htm">Maid</a> <a href="/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">Maiden</a> <a href="/2_kings/5-18.htm">Master</a> <a href="/2_kings/5-6.htm">Naaman</a> <a href="/2_kings/5-6.htm">Na'aman</a> <a href="/1_chronicles/11-17.htm">Someone</a><div class="vheading2">2 Kings 5</div><span class="reftext">1. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="/2_kings/5-1.htm">Naaman, by the report of a captive maid, is sent to Samaria to be cured of leprosy</a></span><br><span class="reftext">8. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="/2_kings/5-8.htm">Elisha, sending him to Jordan cures him</a></span><br><span class="reftext">15. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm">He refusing Naaman's gifts grants him some of the earth</a></span><br><span class="reftext">20. </span><span class="outlinetext"><a href="/2_kings/5-20.htm">Gehazi, abusing his master's name unto Naaman, is smitten with leprosy</a></span><br></div></div><div id="mdd"><div align="center"><div class="bot2"><table align="center" width="100%"><tr><td><div align="center">

This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Near Eastern societies, where military leaders had direct access to royalty. Naaman's willingness to seek help from a foreign source indicates his desperation due to his leprosy, a condition that was socially and religiously isolating. This action also shows his trust in the information provided by his wife's servant girl, highlighting the importance of faith and humility.<p><b>what the girl from the land of Israel had said</b><br>The servant girl, taken captive from Israel, plays a pivotal role in Naaman's story. Her faith in the prophet Elisha's ability to heal is a testament to the power and reputation of the God of Israel, even among captives. This reflects the biblical theme of God using the lowly and unexpected to fulfill His purposes. Her mention of a prophet in Israel points to the broader narrative of God's prophets being instruments of His power and mercy. This also foreshadows the New Testament theme of faith transcending cultural and national boundaries, as seen in Jesus' interactions with Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naaman.htm">Naaman</a></b><br>A commander of the army of the king of Aram, highly regarded and a valiant soldier, but he suffered from leprosy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_aram.htm">The King of Aram</a></b><br>Naaman's master, who held a position of authority and influence in Aram (modern-day Syria).<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_girl_from_israel.htm">The Girl from Israel</a></b><br>A young Israelite girl taken captive, serving Naaman's wife, who shared the news of a prophet in Israel who could heal Naaman.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The land where the prophet Elisha resided, representing God's chosen people and the place of divine intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>The prophet in Israel who ultimately provides the means for Naaman's healing through God's power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_a_testimony.htm">The Power of a Testimony</a></b><br>The young girl's simple testimony about the prophet in Israel led to Naaman's journey of faith and healing.
