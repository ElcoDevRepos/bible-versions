The act of speaking kindly indicates a shift in Jehoiachin's fortunes, as he had been imprisoned for 37 years. This kindness can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to preserve a remnant of David's line, as Jehoiachin was a descendant of David. The act of speaking kindly also reflects the ancient Near Eastern custom of showing mercy to defeated kings, which could be a political strategy to maintain stability in the region.<p><b>and set his throne above the thrones of the other kings who were with him in Babylon</b><br>This indicates that Jehoiachin was given a position of honor above other vassal kings who were also in Babylon. This elevation can be seen as a sign of respect and possibly a recognition of the Davidic line's significance. It also suggests that Jehoiachin was treated not merely as a prisoner but as a royal guest, which could symbolize hope for the restoration of Judah. This act of setting his throne above others can be seen as a type of Christ, who is exalted above all kings and rulers. The historical context here is significant, as it shows the political dynamics of the Babylonian empire, where multiple kings were often kept in the court as a means of control and influence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiachin.htm">Jehoiachin</a></b><br>The former king of Judah who was taken captive by the Babylonians.
