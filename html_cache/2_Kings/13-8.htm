His reign is characterized by a period of spiritual decline and oppression by the Arameans. The phrase suggests that there were additional deeds and events during his reign that are not detailed in the biblical narrative, indicating a broader historical context.<p><b>along with all his accomplishments and his might</b><br>This phrase acknowledges that Jehoahaz had achievements and demonstrated strength, despite the challenges faced during his reign. Historically, kings were often judged by their military successes and ability to maintain control over their territories. The mention of his might suggests that he had some military or political successes, even if they were not enough to deliver Israel from its troubles.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</b><br>This rhetorical question points to a now-lost historical record that chronicled the reigns of the kings of Israel. It implies that a more detailed account of Jehoahaz's reign was available to the original audience. The reference to this book highlights the practice of keeping royal annals, a common practice in the ancient Near East, which served as official records of a king's reign.

Just as <a href="/1_kings/14-19.htm">1 Kings 14:19</a> and <a href="/2_kings/10-34.htm">2 Kings 10:34</a> use the same wording for other rulers, the Spirit is reminding us that each king&#8217;s reign was fuller and more complex than the highlights preserved in the inspired narrative. By acknowledging &#8220;the rest,&#8221; Scripture affirms both selective inspiration and historical completeness&#8212;what we have is sufficient for faith and obedience, yet the events themselves were extensive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with all his accomplishments</b><p>The verse points to &#8220;all his accomplishments,&#8221; underscoring that Jehoahaz did have positive achievements, even though his reign was largely marked by spiritual failure (<a href="/2_kings/13-1.htm">2 Kings 13:1&#8211;3</a>). This mirrors accounts such as <a href="/2_chronicles/27-7.htm">2 Chronicles 27:7</a>, where Jotham&#8217;s deeds are similarly referenced. The line suggests that God&#8217;s common grace allowed Jehoahaz to govern, wage battles, and manage affairs, reminding us that every leader, even a flawed one, can leave tangible accomplishments behind (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his might</b><p>&#8220;Might&#8221; speaks of military prowess and personal strength. Though only briefly mentioned, his military campaigns are hinted at in <a href="/2_kings/13-22.htm">2 Kings 13:22&#8211;23</a>, where the Arameans oppressed Israel and the Lord ultimately showed mercy. The same term is applied to other kings, such as in <a href="/1_kings/15-23.htm">1 Kings 15:23</a> regarding Asa. The verse signals that Jehoahaz&#8217;s valor, victories, and maybe even strategic failures were noted somewhere, reinforcing that God sees and records every deed (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</b><p>This rhetorical question, repeated throughout Kings (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/16-5.htm">1 Kings 16:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-18.htm">2 Kings 14:18</a>), directs readers to official royal annals no longer extant. By pointing to these records, the inspired author authenticates his history:<p>&#8226; The events were documented contemporaneously, verifying accuracy.<p>&#8226; Faith is anchored in real time and space; God works within verifiable history (<a href="/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; What God chose to include in Scripture is what we need for doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>), while other details rest in His providential archive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/13-8.htm">2 Kings 13:8</a> is a divinely inspired footnote reminding us that Jehoahaz&#8217;s reign, though briefly covered in Scripture, was fully known to God and thoroughly chronicled in Israel&#8217;s official records. The verse affirms the reliability of the biblical account, acknowledges Jehoahaz&#8217;s mix of achievements and failures, and underscores that God&#8217;s Word gives us exactly what we need while pointing to a broader historical canvas on which He faithfully acts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And his might.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">prowess.</span> The reference is to his wars with the Syrians.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might</span>; rather, <span class="accented">his prowess</span>, or <span class="accented">his valor</span>.
