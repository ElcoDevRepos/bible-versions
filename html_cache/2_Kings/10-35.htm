The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a joining with ancestors in the afterlife. Jehu's reign was marked by his zealous actions to eradicate the house of Ahab and the worship of Baal, fulfilling the prophecy given to Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16-17</a>). His death signifies the end of a significant chapter in Israel's history, where he was used as an instrument of divine judgment.<p><b>and was buried in Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, established by King Omri (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). It served as the political and religious center of the kingdom. Jehu's burial in Samaria indicates his status as a legitimate king of Israel, despite his violent rise to power. Archaeological findings in Samaria, such as the Samaria Ostraca, provide insights into the administrative and economic life during the period of the Israelite monarchy.<p><b>and his son Jehoahaz reigned in his place</b><br>Jehoahaz's succession to the throne continues the dynastic line of Jehu, as promised by God that his descendants would sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>). Jehoahaz's reign, however, was marked by continued struggles against the Arameans, reflecting the ongoing political instability and spiritual decline in Israel. This transition of power highlights the cyclical nature of Israel's history, where periods of reform and faithfulness are often followed by times of apostasy and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The tenth king of the northern kingdom of Israel, known for his zealous eradication of Baal worship and the house of Ahab.

Though he fell short of wholehearted obedience, God&#8217;s promise of four generations on Israel&#8217;s throne (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>) remains intact.<p>&#8226; By aligning Jehu with &#8220;his fathers,&#8221; the text affirms the historical continuity of God&#8217;s dealings with Israel and anticipates the resurrection hope seen later in passages such as <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;and was buried in Samaria</b><p>&#8226; Samaria, founded by Omri (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>), had become the royal burial ground for northern kings (<a href="/1_kings/16-28.htm">1 Kings 16:28</a>).
