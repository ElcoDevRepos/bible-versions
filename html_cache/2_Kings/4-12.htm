Gehazi's role is significant as he often acts as a mediator between Elisha and others. This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Israelite society, where prophets often had attendants. Gehazi's later actions in <a href="/2_kings/5.htm">2 Kings 5</a> reveal his character flaws, contrasting with Elisha's integrity.<p><b>&#8220;Call the Shunammite woman.&#8221;</b><br>The Shunammite woman is a notable figure in <a href="/2_kings/4.htm">2 Kings 4</a>. She is from Shunem, a town in the territory of Issachar, located in the Jezreel Valley. Her hospitality towards Elisha demonstrates her faith and respect for God's prophet. Her story parallels the hospitality shown to prophets in other biblical accounts, such as the widow of Zarephath with Elijah (1 Kings 17). The Shunammite woman's interactions with Elisha highlight themes of faith, divine reward, and the miraculous.<p><b>And when he had called her,</b><br>Gehazi acts on Elisha's command, showing the obedience expected of a servant. This action sets the stage for the Shunammite woman's direct interaction with Elisha, emphasizing the importance of her role in the narrative. Her willingness to respond to the call reflects her respect and trust in Elisha, which is crucial for the unfolding of the miracle that follows.<p><b>she stood before him,</b><br>The Shunammite woman's presence before Elisha signifies her readiness to receive a message or blessing. Standing before a prophet was a position of humility and expectation. This moment foreshadows the significant interaction that will lead to the promise of a son, a theme reminiscent of other biblical accounts where God grants children to barren women, such as Sarah (Genesis 18) and Hannah (1 Samuel 1).
