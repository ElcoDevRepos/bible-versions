Naaman, a Syrian commander, had been healed of leprosy by following the prophet Elisha's instructions to wash in the Jordan River. Gehazi, Elisha's servant, pursued Naaman to deceitfully obtain gifts, directly disobeying Elisha's refusal of any reward. The punishment reflects the seriousness of Gehazi's actions, as leprosy was a feared and isolating disease in ancient Israel, often seen as a divine judgment. The phrase "cling to you and your descendants forever" indicates a generational curse, emphasizing the long-lasting consequences of sin. This echoes the biblical principle that the sins of the fathers can affect future generations, as seen in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>.<p><b>And as Gehazi left his presence, he was leprous&#8212;</b><br>The immediacy of Gehazi's punishment underscores the gravity of his sin. Leprosy in biblical times was not only a physical ailment but also a social and spiritual stigma, rendering the afflicted ceremonially unclean and excluded from the community (Leviticus 13-14). Gehazi's leprosy serves as a physical manifestation of his inner corruption and deceit. This moment also highlights the authority of Elisha as a prophet of God, whose words carry divine power and judgment.<p><b>as white as snow.</b><br>The description "as white as snow" emphasizes the severity of Gehazi's condition. In biblical symbolism, whiteness often represents purity and holiness (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>), but here it starkly contrasts with Gehazi's moral impurity. The phrase also vividly illustrates the transformation from health to disease, serving as a visual representation of Gehazi's spiritual state. This imagery is echoed in other biblical accounts, such as Miriam's leprosy in <a href="/numbers/12-10.htm">Numbers 12:10</a>, reinforcing the idea that divine judgment can be both immediate and visible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naaman.htm">Naaman</a></b><br>A commander of the army of the king of Aram, who was healed of leprosy by following the prophet Elisha's instructions to wash in the Jordan River.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, who performed many miracles, including the healing of Naaman.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gehazi.htm">Gehazi</a></b><br>The servant of Elisha who, driven by greed, deceitfully obtained gifts from Naaman and was consequently cursed with leprosy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/leprosy.htm">Leprosy</a></b><br>A chronic infectious disease, often seen as a symbol of sin and impurity in biblical times, which Gehazi and his descendants were cursed with.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram</a></b><br>A region and kingdom in ancient Syria, often in conflict with Israel, where Naaman served as a military commander.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_greed.htm">The Consequences of Greed</a></b><br>Gehazi's account illustrates how greed can lead to severe consequences, not only affecting the individual but also their descendants.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_service.htm">Integrity in Service</a></b><br>As servants of God, maintaining integrity and honesty is crucial.
