His acts, not fully detailed in the biblical text, likely included both political maneuvers and military campaigns. Menahem's reign is characterized by his brutal suppression of opposition, as seen in his violent actions against the city of Tiphsah. This phrase suggests that there were additional deeds and events during his reign that were significant but not recorded in the biblical narrative.<p><b>along with all his accomplishments</b><br>The term "accomplishments" implies that Menahem achieved certain goals or completed projects during his reign. These could have included building projects, economic reforms, or military victories. However, the biblical text often evaluates kings not just by their accomplishments but by their faithfulness to God. Menahem's reign is noted for its idolatry and failure to lead the people back to the worship of Yahweh, which would have been considered a failure from a biblical perspective.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</b><br>This phrase refers to a historical record that is no longer extant, which chronicled the reigns of the kings of Israel. It suggests that a more detailed account of Menahem's reign was available to the original audience. The mention of this book indicates the existence of other historical sources outside the biblical text that documented the history of Israel. This phrase is a common formula in the books of Kings, emphasizing the selective nature of the biblical narrative, which focuses on theological rather than exhaustive historical details.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/menahem.htm">Menahem</a></b><br>He was the king of Israel who reigned for ten years.

Scripture openly acknowledges there was more to the story&#8212;yet everything recorded is precisely what God wants us to know (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_kings/15-17.htm">2 Kings 15:17-18</a> outlines his rise to power and the continued evil &#8220;in the sight of the LORD,&#8221; echoing earlier notices about Israel&#8217;s kings (<a href="/1_kings/16-19.htm">1 Kings 16:19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-2.htm">2 Kings 13:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Verse 19 shows his desperate alliance with Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria, a turning point that accelerated Israel&#8217;s decline (compare <a href="/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Like other royal summaries&#8212;&#8220;the rest of the acts of Solomon&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-41.htm">1 Kings 11:41</a>)&#8212;this phrase assures readers that the biblical author is not omitting anything essential for faith and obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Along with all his accomplishments</b><p>The word translated &#8220;accomplishments&#8221; reminds us that even ungodly rulers can build, negotiate, and organize. God&#8217;s Word records deeds without endorsing them (<a href="/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Menahem&#8217;s main &#8220;accomplishment&#8221; was extracting fifty shekels of silver from every wealthy man to pay Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a>), buying a fragile peace at enormous moral cost.<p>&#8226; His brutal start&#8212;&#8220;he struck down Tiphsah&#8230; ripping open all the pregnant women&#8221; (15:16)&#8212;reveals the kind of &#8220;accomplishments&#8221; power can produce when it is disconnected from God&#8217;s law (<a href="/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern repeats throughout Kings: achievements divorced from covenant faithfulness never secure lasting blessing (cf. <a href="/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-34.htm">2 Kings 10:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are they not written</b><p>This rhetorical question underscores reliability.
