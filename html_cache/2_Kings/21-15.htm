The "evil" refers to idolatry and the abandonment of the covenant established with God. This is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, where the Israelites often turned to worship other gods, such as Baal and Asherah, which was considered evil in the sight of the Lord. The phrase underscores God's omniscience, as He sees all actions and intentions of His people.<p><b>and have provoked Me to anger</b><br>The provocation of God's anger is a significant theme in the Old Testament, where God's righteous indignation is aroused by the people's persistent sinfulness. This anger is not capricious but is a response to the violation of the covenant relationship. The anger of God is often depicted as leading to judgment and punishment, such as the Babylonian exile. This reflects the holiness of God and His intolerance of sin.<p><b>from the day their fathers came out of Egypt</b><br>This phrase refers to the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history when God delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Despite witnessing God's miraculous works, the Israelites frequently rebelled against Him, as seen in the wilderness wanderings. This historical context emphasizes the long-standing nature of Israel's disobedience and the patience of God over generations.<p><b>until this day.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "until this day" indicates the ongoing nature of Israel's rebellion up to the time of King Manasseh, under whose reign this verse is set. Manasseh's reign is noted for its extreme idolatry and evil practices, which were seen as a culmination of the nation's persistent sin. This continuity of disobedience serves as a backdrop for the eventual judgment that would come upon Judah, leading to the Babylonian exile. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the need for repentance and the hope of restoration, themes that are echoed in the prophetic books.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his idolatry and leading the nation into sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which Manasseh ruled, and which was led astray by his actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place from which the Israelites were delivered, symbolizing their covenant relationship with God and their history of deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is expressing His anger due to the persistent disobedience of His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The event of Israel's deliverance from Egypt, marking the beginning of their covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Manasseh's reign illustrates the severe consequences of turning away from God and embracing idolatry.

The phrase reminds us that the Lord sees and evaluates every deed (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>). In Manasseh&#8217;s day those deeds included idolatry, sorcery, child sacrifice, and the placement of pagan altars inside the very temple (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3&#8211;7</a>). Earlier generations practiced the same pattern&#8212;&#8220;Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/14-22.htm">1 Kings 14:22</a>), and &#8220;the Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>). The standard never changes:<p>&#8226; God alone defines right and wrong.<p>&#8226; His &#8220;sight&#8221; means His all-seeing, personal involvement.<p>&#8226; Evil is not merely unfortunate; it is rebellion against the Creator who has already revealed His will (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Have Provoked Me to Anger</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;and have provoked Me to anger.&#8221; Scripture repeatedly pictures God&#8217;s anger as righteous, measured, and covenantal. Israel provoked Him at Horeb with the golden calf (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7&#8211;8</a>), in the wilderness with constant grumbling (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>), and in the land through centuries of idolatry (<a href="/psalms/78-56.htm">Psalm 78:56&#8211;58</a>).

By Manasseh&#8217;s reign every warning&#8212;prophets like Isaiah, Hosea, and Micah&#8212;had been ignored. God now announces judgment: Jerusalem will be wiped &#8220;as one wipes a dish&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/21-13.htm">2 Kings 21:13</a>). Similar language appeared just before the fall of the northern kingdom (<a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18&#8211;20</a>). The faithful remnant had dwindled, and mercy gives way to justice. Peter later explains the principle: God is &#8220;patient&#8230; not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>), yet eventual judgment is certain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/21-15.htm">2 Kings 21:15</a> crystallizes why judgment was inevitable for Judah. God had watched every act, labeled it evil, endured centuries of provocation, and extended patient mercy from the Exodus onward. By Manasseh&#8217;s day the nation&#8217;s sin was persistent and unrepentant, leaving the Lord&#8212;who is perfectly just and faithful to His covenant&#8212;no option but to discipline His people. The verse therefore teaches both the seriousness of sin and the steadfast, righteous character of God: long-suffering yet unwavering in holiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Have provoked me.</span>--<span class= "ital">Have been provoking; i.e.,</span> continually.<p><span class= "bld">Their fathers came forth.</span>--The LXX. has probably preserved the original reading: <span class= "ital">I</span> <span class= "ital">brought forth their fathers.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because they have done that which was evil in my sight.</span> The chief sins of the people were the following: Altars for the worship of the host of heaven were erected upon almost every roof (<a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>); offerings of cakes were made in the very streets to Astarte (<a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>); the fire of Tophet - a huge furnace in the valley of Hinnom - was kept constantly burning, and the sacrifice of innocent children to the bloody sun-god, Moloch, was perpetual (<a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/23-37.htm">Ezekiel 23:37</a>); it was as common to swear by the name of Moloch as by that of Jehovah (<a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>). Lascivious rites were practiced. Close by the temple the unchaste <span class="accented">priestesses</span> of Venus had their habitations, and their wretched male attendants, the Galli of the classical writers, plied their trade (<a href="/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>). Cruelty and oppression increased among the upper classes (<a href="/zephaniah/3-1.htm">Zephaniah 3:1-3</a>); the prophets were "light and treacherous persons;" the priests "polluted the sanctuary, and did violence to the Law" (<a href="/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1-3</a>). "Spoiling and violence," "strife and contention;" were rife throughout the city (<a href="/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>). Ewald sums up the state of things as follows: "The atmosphere of the age was poisoned from above; and the leaders of the people of every class, whose moral decline had already become a subject of lament in the preceding century, sank into an almost incredible degeneracy. The prophets, who ought to have been ever the most loyal guardians of the truth, were for the most part like dumb and greedy dogs; many of the priests allowed themselves to be seduced into offering heathen sacrifices; the judges and nobles paid little heed to the eternal right. Equivocation and hypocrisy spread among those who ought to have ministered most austerely to public truthfulness of life; while those who were engaged in commerce and trade sank into the harshest indifference to every higher aim, and thought only of the acquisition and enjoyment of wealth. So terrible was the demoralization which set in under Manasseh, that those who remained faithful to the ancient religion were either scoffed at as fools, or allowed to perish in cold contempt without any effort being made to save them, and were even derided after their death." <span class="cmt_word">And have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.</span> The moral and spiritual depravity of Judah, though it only came to a head in the time of Manasseh, had its roots in a long-distant past. As St. Stephen pointed out to the Sanhedrin (<a href="/acts/7-39.htm">Acts 7:39-43</a>), it began in the wilderness with the worship of the golden calf, and went on to the worship of the host of heaven, of Moloch, and of Remphan; it was shown markedly in the terrible sin of Peer (<a href="/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>); it stinted God's hand when the nations had to be driven out from Canaan (<a href="/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1-5</a>);
