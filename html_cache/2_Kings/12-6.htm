His reign is noted for the restoration of the temple, which had fallen into disrepair. The twenty-third year marks a significant point in his reign, highlighting a period of stagnation in the temple repairs. This delay reflects the challenges in leadership and the complexities of managing religious and political duties. Joash's reign is a reminder of the importance of perseverance and accountability in leadership.<p><b>however, the priests had not yet repaired the damage to the temple</b><br>The temple, central to Jewish worship and national identity, had suffered damage over the years, possibly due to neglect and previous invasions. The priests were responsible for maintaining the temple, but their failure to repair it by this time suggests issues of mismanagement or misallocation of resources. This situation underscores the need for integrity and diligence in handling sacred duties. The delay in repairs can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual neglect, emphasizing the need for renewal and restoration in one's relationship with God. The temple's restoration is a precursor to the ultimate restoration through Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), symbolizing the new covenant and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>King of Judah who began his reign at a young age and was initially guided by the priest Jehoiada.

They had simply been negligent. Probably very little money had come in; and they had not been very active in their endeavors to obtain larger contributions. It must be remembered that what went to the fabric fund would, for the most part, be a deduction from the ordinary revenue of the temple, which was not, perhaps, much in excess of the ordinary demands upon it. We can, therefore, quite understand that the king's policy would not be popular with the priests (see <a href="/2_chronicles/24-5.htm">2 Chronicles 24:5</a>). Still, it is to be observed that they are not said to have executed no repairs, but only not to have "made haste" and completed their task by the time that the king looked for its completion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/12-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
