In the context of ancient Near Eastern monarchies, becoming king at a relatively young age was not uncommon. Jotham's age suggests a period of preparation and possibly co-regency with his father, Uzziah, who was struck with leprosy (<a href="/2_kings/15-5.htm">2 Kings 15:5</a>). This transition period would have allowed Jotham to gain experience in governance and leadership.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years</b><br>Jotham's reign in Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, lasted for sixteen years. This period was marked by relative stability and prosperity, as Jotham is noted for doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD (<a href="/2_kings/15-34.htm">2 Kings 15:34</a>). Jerusalem, as the political and spiritual center of Judah, was significant in maintaining the Davidic line, which is central to biblical prophecy concerning the Messiah (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Jotham's reign is also mentioned in the context of the Assyrian threat, which began to loom over the region during this time.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok</b><br>The mention of Jotham's mother, Jerusha, and her father, Zadok, highlights the importance of maternal lineage in the biblical narrative. Jerusha's name, meaning "possession" or "inheritance," and her connection to Zadok, a name associated with righteousness, may imply a heritage of faithfulness. The inclusion of maternal lineage in the biblical text often underscores the influence of the mother in the king's upbringing and character. This detail also serves to authenticate the historical record, as genealogies were crucial for establishing legitimacy and continuity in the royal line.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jotham was the king of Judah.

Whether or not they are directly related, the link reminds readers of Judah&#8217;s priestly heritage and the importance of godly lineage.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/27-6.htm">2 Chronicles 27:6</a> notes that Jotham &#8220;grew powerful because he ordered his ways before the LORD,&#8221; hinting that Jerusha&#8217;s influence helped cultivate reverence in her son.<p>&#8226; The detail also affirms the biblical value placed on women in salvation history, foreshadowing how Mary&#8217;s obedience would matter in the coming of Christ (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/15-33.htm">2 Kings 15:33</a> presents more than raw statistics. The verse assures us that God accurately records His dealings with real people, highlights the legitimacy of youthful yet prepared leadership, showcases a reign marked by godly stability, and honors the quiet but vital role of a mother who helped shape a righteous king. Together these truths invite us to trust Scripture&#8217;s detail, value faithfulness over longevity, and invest in the next generation for the glory of the One who guides every throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> sixteen years from his appointment to be regent, as appears plainly from <a href="/2_chronicles/26-23.htm">2 Chronicles 26:23</a> and 2 Chron 27:1 (comp.
