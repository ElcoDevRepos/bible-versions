The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a joining with ancestors in the afterlife. Menahem's reign was marked by brutality and oppression, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/15-16.htm">2 Kings 15:16</a>, where he attacked Tiphsah and ripped open pregnant women. His death marks the end of a turbulent period in Israel's history. The phrase also reflects the belief in an afterlife and the continuation of one's lineage, a significant aspect of Israelite culture.<p><b>and his son Pekahiah reigned in his place</b><br>Pekahiah's succession to the throne follows the typical pattern of dynastic succession in the ancient Near East, where kingship often passed from father to son. Pekahiah's reign, however, was short-lived, lasting only two years (<a href="/2_kings/15-23.htm">2 Kings 15:23-24</a>). His rule was characterized by continued idolatry, as he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, who led Israel into sin. This transition of power highlights the instability of the Northern Kingdom during this period, as frequent assassinations and coups were common. Pekahiah's reign would eventually end with his assassination by Pekah, one of his own officers, illustrating the ongoing political turmoil and the failure to adhere to the covenant with God, which was a recurring theme in the history of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/menahem.htm">Menahem</a></b><br>Menahem was a king of Israel who reigned for ten years.

Yet, unlike Judah&#8217;s Davidic line, Israel&#8217;s dynasties were often short-lived; Pekahiah&#8217;s reign would last only two years before assassination (<a href="/2_kings/15-23.htm">2 Kings 15:23-26</a>).<p>&#8226; God had promised longevity to a dynasty only if the king walked in His ways (<a href="/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4-6</a>).
