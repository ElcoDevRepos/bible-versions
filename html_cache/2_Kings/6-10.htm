The "man of God" refers to Elisha, a prophet who succeeded Elijah and was known for his miraculous works and divine insight. Elisha's role as a prophet was to communicate God's will and guidance to the people and their leaders. The phrase indicates a direct communication between the prophet and the king, highlighting the importance of prophetic guidance in Israel's military and political strategies. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using prophets to direct and protect His people. The "place" mentioned would have been a strategic location where the Arameans, led by King Ben-Hadad, planned to ambush the Israelites. This demonstrates the ongoing conflict between Israel and Aram, a common theme in the historical books of the Old Testament.<p><b>Time and again Elisha warned the king,</b><br>Elisha's repeated warnings to the king underscore his role as a vigilant and faithful servant of God, who consistently provided divine insight to protect Israel. This persistence in warning the king illustrates the patience and dedication of God's prophets, as well as God's mercy in giving Israel multiple opportunities to avoid disaster. The phrase "time and again" suggests a pattern of divine intervention, emphasizing God's active involvement in the affairs of His people. This also reflects the biblical principle that God often uses His prophets to deliver messages of warning and guidance, as seen in other instances such as Nathan's confrontation with David (2 Samuel 12) and Jonah's warning to Nineveh (Jonah 3).<p><b>so that he was on his guard in such places.</b><br>The king's response to Elisha's warnings by being "on his guard" indicates a level of trust and reliance on the prophet's words. This vigilance helped protect Israel from the Aramean threats, showcasing the practical benefits of heeding divine counsel. The phrase highlights the importance of obedience to God's guidance for the safety and success of His people. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God as a protector and defender of Israel, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>, which speaks of God watching over Israel. The strategic military context here is significant, as it demonstrates how spiritual insight can have tangible effects on national security and leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel.
