This covenant signifies a renewal of the people's commitment to God, reminiscent of covenants made by leaders like Moses (<a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7-8</a>) and Joshua (<a href="/joshua/24-25.htm">Joshua 24:25</a>). It underscores the importance of national and spiritual unity under God's sovereignty. The covenant reflects the theocratic nature of Israel, where the king was expected to lead the people in obedience to God&#8217;s laws. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who mediates a new covenant between God and His people (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<p><b>that they would be the LORD&#8217;s people</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the identity and calling of Israel as God's chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). It is a reaffirmation of their unique relationship with God, which required exclusive worship and obedience. The covenant aimed to restore the nation&#8217;s focus on their divine purpose, contrasting with the idolatry and apostasy that had plagued Judah under previous rulers. This echoes the call for Christians to be a holy nation and a people belonging to God (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>He also made a covenant between the king and the people</b><br>This covenant established the responsibilities and expectations between the king and his subjects. It was a mutual agreement ensuring that the king would rule justly and the people would support him, reflecting the biblical principle of righteous leadership (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>). This covenant can be compared to the covenantal relationship between Christ, the King, and His Church, where Christ leads with justice and love, and His followers respond with faithfulness and obedience (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23-24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada.htm">Jehoiada</a></b><br>A high priest who played a crucial role in the preservation of the Davidic line by protecting Joash and orchestrating his rise to the throne.
