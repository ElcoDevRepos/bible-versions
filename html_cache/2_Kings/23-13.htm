The Moabites were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>), and their worship of Chemosh was a significant point of conflict with Israel.

Such cruelty stands in stark contrast to the character of the Lord, who forbade it outright.<p>&#8226; By mentioning Milcom last, the verse piles up a crescendo of detestable practices that had been tolerated. Josiah&#8217;s reforms therefore marked a decisive break with neighboring nations&#8217; gods (<a href="/zephaniah/1-4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode illustrates a timeless principle: partial reform is not enough; all competing loyalties must be torn down (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a> records Josiah&#8217;s removal of three ancient shrines&#8212;erected by Solomon generations earlier&#8212;on the Mount of Corruption east of Jerusalem. Each shrine honored a foreign deity (Ashtoreth, Chemosh, Milcom) that Scripture labels an &#8220;abomination.&#8221; By desecrating these high places, Josiah fulfilled God&#8217;s command to purge idolatry, reclaimed territory dangerously close to the temple, and demonstrated unwavering loyalty to the Lord. The verse reminds us that tolerated sin can persist long after its introduction, but faithful obedience decisively uproots it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">The high places that were before the city . . .</span>--See <a href="/context/1_kings/11-5.htm" title="For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.">1Kings 11:5-8</a>.

It still bears the name of the "Hill of Offence," derived from the Vulg. "mons offensionis." (The word rendered "corruption," <span class= "ital">mashhith</span>, may originally have meant "anointing," from <span class= "ital">m?shah</span> "to anoint," and have simply referred to the olive oil there produced.

Such sites have been found in Palestine; and it is hardly conceivable that <span class= "ital">chapels</span> erected by Solomon for the worship of Ashtoreth, Chemosh, and Milcom, would have been spared by such a king as Hezekiah, who even did away with the high places dedicated to Jehovah (<a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm" title="And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.">2Kings 18:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the high places that were before Jerusalem.</span> The high places which Solomon established in the neighborhood of Jerusalem for the use of his wives, and in the worship at which he became himself entangled in his old age, appear to have been situated on the ridge of the mountain which lies over against Jerusalem to the east, a part of which is Olivet. The southern summit, the traditional roans <span class="accented">offensionis</span>, was probably the high place of Moloch (Milcom), while the most northern summit (now called <span class="accented">Karem-es-Seyad</span>) has some claim to be regarded as the high place of Chemosh. (So Broeardus in A.D. .) The site of the high place of Ashtoreth is doubtful. <span class="cmt_word">Which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption.</span> The name "mount of corruption" seems to have been given after Solomon's time to the entire ridge of hills which lies over against Jerusalem to the east, on account of the rites which he had allowed to be established on it. The "right hand" of the mountain would, according to Jewish notions, be the more southern part. <span class="cmt_word">Which Solomon the King of Israel</span> - rather, <span class="accented">King of Israel</span>, since there is no article - <span class="cmt_word">had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians</span> (see <a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>). Though Ashtoreth, or Astarte, or Ishtar, or the Dea Syra, was worshipped generally throughout Phoenicia, and perhaps even more widely, yet she was in a peculiar way "the abomination of the Zidonians," being the deity to whom the city of Sidon was especially dedicated (see the inscription on the tomb of Eshmunazar, published in the 'Records of the Past,' vol. 9. pp. 113, 114). <span class="cmt_word">And for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites.</span> Chemosh appears as the special god of the Moabites on the famous Moabite Stone in eleven places. The stone itself was dedicated to Chemosh (line 3). The Moabites are spoken of as "the people of Chemosh" (lines 5, 6). Success in war comes from him, and defeat is the result of his anger. One of his designations is "Ashtar-Chemosh" (line 17), or "Chemosh, who is also Ashtar," Ashtar being the male principle corresponding to the female Astarte or Ashtoreth. <span class="cmt_word">And for Milcom.</span> Moloch was called by the Jews "Milcom," or "Malcam" - "their king" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the king of the Ammonite people, since he was the sole god whom they acknowledged (see <a href="/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5</a>;
