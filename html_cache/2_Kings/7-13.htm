In the context of ancient Israel, servants often played significant roles in the narrative, sometimes providing wisdom or insight. This reflects the biblical theme that God can use anyone, regardless of their social status, to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>Please, have scouts take five of the horses that remain in the city</b><br>The mention of "five of the horses that remain" indicates the dire situation in Samaria during the siege by the Arameans. Horses were valuable assets, often used for war and transportation, and their scarcity underscores the severity of the famine. The servant suggests sending scouts, which shows a proactive approach to seeking God's deliverance, reminiscent of the spies sent by Moses in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>.<p><b>Their plight will be no worse than all the Israelites who are left here</b><br>This reflects the desperation and hopelessness within the besieged city. The servant's logic is that the risk of sending scouts is minimal compared to the certain death facing those who remain. This mirrors the biblical principle of faith over fear, as seen in other instances where God's people are called to step out in faith despite dire circumstances.<p><b>You can see that all the Israelites here are doomed</b><br>The statement acknowledges the grim reality of the situation. The use of "doomed" highlights the severity of the famine and siege, which aligns with the curses for disobedience outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. It also sets the stage for God's miraculous intervention, a common theme where God delivers His people when all hope seems lost.<p><b>So let us send them and find out</b><br>This call to action demonstrates a willingness to seek out God's deliverance actively. It parallels other biblical narratives where exploration or reconnaissance leads to divine revelation or intervention, such as the sending of the twelve spies into Canaan. It also foreshadows the fulfillment of Elisha's prophecy of deliverance, emphasizing the importance of faith and action in the face of adversity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>The ruler during the time of the Aramean siege of Samaria, who is faced with a dire situation and is seeking a solution.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>An unnamed servant of the king who suggests sending men to investigate the situation with the Arameans, showing initiative and faith in the possibility of deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which is under siege by the Arameans, leading to a severe famine.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_arameans.htm">The Arameans</a></b><br>The enemy army besieging Samaria, causing the famine and desperation among the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_horses.htm">The Horses</a></b><br>Representing the limited resources left in the city, highlighting the desperation and the risk involved in the servant's suggestion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The servant's suggestion to send men to investigate demonstrates faith in God's deliverance.

In that tense moment, an unnamed servant steps forward&#8212;much like Naaman&#8217;s servants did earlier (<a href="/2_kings/5-13.htm">2 Kings 5:13</a>). God often uses humble voices to direct those in authority (<a href="/1_samuel/3-8.htm">1 Samuel 3:8-9</a>; <a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>). The servant&#8217;s reply is a spark of commonsense faith amid widespread fear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Please, have scouts take five of the horses that remain in the city</b><p>Samaria is under siege (<a href="/2_kings/6-24.htm">2 Kings 6:24-25</a>). Horses are scarce and precious, yet the servant proposes using five&#8212;symbolizing a token yet sufficient force (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>). His plan echoes Joshua&#8217;s spies in Jericho (<a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>) and Moses&#8217; twelve in Canaan (<a href="/numbers/13-2.htm">Numbers 13:2</a>). Faith never ignores facts; it prudently gathers them, trusting God will act through ordinary means.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their plight will be no worse than all the Israelites who are left here</b><p>The logic is simple: nothing to lose. This mirrors the four lepers&#8217; earlier reasoning, &#8220;If they kill us, we will only die&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/7-4.htm">2 Kings 7:4</a>). Esther voiced the same courage&#8212;&#8220;If I perish, I perish&#8221; (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>). When hope in human resources is gone, confidence in God&#8217;s word can flourish (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You can see that all the Israelites here are doomed</b><p>Famine and despair are visibly crushing the city (<a href="/2_kings/6-28.htm">2 Kings 6:28-29</a>). The servant articulates the dire reality everyone can &#8220;see&#8221; (compare <a href="/lamentations/4-4.htm">Lamentations 4:4-10</a>). Acknowledging true need prepares hearts for divine intervention (<a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17-18</a>). God&#8217;s deliverances often come when circumstances are undeniably impossible (<a href="/exodus/14-10.htm">Exodus 14:10-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So let us send them and find out</b><p>Action follows conviction. The suggestion moves the king from paralysis to obedience, leading to the discovery of the deserted Aramean camp and the fulfillment of Elisha&#8217;s word (<a href="/2_kings/7-14.htm">2 Kings 7:14-16</a>). James later affirms, &#8220;Faith without deeds is dead&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). Small steps taken in faith can unlock God&#8217;s promised abundance (<a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>; <a href="/john/2-5.htm">John 2:5-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/7-13.htm">2 Kings 7:13</a> records a servant&#8217;s practical yet faith-filled counsel during Samaria&#8217;s darkest hour. He proposes a limited reconnaissance with the few horses left, reasoning that the risk is no greater than their present doom. By facing reality honestly and acting on God&#8217;s prophetic word, the servant becomes a catalyst for the miracle that follows. The verse reminds us that trusting God&#8217;s promises often involves taking sensible steps, even when resources are minimal and outcomes seem uncertain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Let some take.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, then) <span class= "ital">let them take</span>.
