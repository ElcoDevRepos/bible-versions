Despite reforms by some kings, these sites persisted in Israel and Judah. The persistence of high places indicates incomplete obedience to God's commands, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-4</a>, where God instructs the Israelites to destroy such places. This phrase highlights the failure of the kings to fully eradicate idolatry, reflecting a recurring theme of partial reform throughout the books of Kings. The high places were often located on hills or mountains, which were considered sacred in many ancient Near Eastern cultures.<p><b>the people continued sacrificing and burning incense there.</b><br>This practice of sacrificing and burning incense at high places was contrary to the centralized worship God commanded at the temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/9-3.htm">1 Kings 9:3</a>). The people's continued use of these sites suggests a syncretism, blending Yahweh worship with local Canaanite practices. This disobedience is a recurring issue in Israel's history, leading to spiritual decline and eventual judgment. The act of burning incense is significant, as it was a key element of worship, symbolizing prayers rising to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>). The persistence of these practices underscores the challenge of maintaining pure worship amidst cultural pressures and highlights the need for spiritual leadership that aligns with God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah.htm">Azariah (Uzziah)</a></b><br>King of Judah who reigned for 52 years.
