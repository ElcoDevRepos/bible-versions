The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a continuation of existence beyond this life, often implying burial in a family tomb. Jehoahaz was the son of Jehu, and his reign was marked by conflict with the Arameans. His death signifies the end of his rule and the transition of leadership. The phrase also reflects the biblical theme of generational continuity and the importance of family lineage in Israel's history.<p><b>and was buried in Samaria.</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, established by King Omri. It served as a political and religious center. The burial of Jehoahaz in Samaria indicates his status as a king and his connection to the royal lineage. Archaeological excavations in Samaria have uncovered significant remains from the period, providing insights into the city's importance and the lifestyle of its inhabitants. The burial in Samaria also underscores the division between the Northern and Southern Kingdoms, with Samaria being a central location for the former.<p><b>And his son Jehoash reigned in his place.</b><br>Jehoash, also known as Joash, succeeded his father Jehoahaz as king of Israel. This transition of power highlights the hereditary monarchy system in ancient Israel. Jehoash's reign continued the struggles against the Arameans, but he also experienced victories, as prophesied by Elisha. The succession of Jehoash is part of the broader narrative of the kings of Israel, where each king's actions are evaluated in light of their faithfulness to God. This phrase also connects to the biblical theme of divine sovereignty over the rise and fall of leaders, as seen throughout the books of Kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoahaz.htm">Jehoahaz</a></b><br>The king of Israel who reigned for 17 years.

It echoes earlier notices such as &#8220;David rested with his fathers&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/2-10.htm">1 Kings 2:10</a>) and reminds us that death is not annihilation but a transition to the Lord&#8217;s presence (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;With his fathers&#8221; stresses covenant continuity; God deals with families and generations (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>). Each king&#8217;s obituary invites the reader to measure that life against God&#8217;s unchanging standard (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; Though Jehoahaz had sought the LORD in crisis and received deliverance (<a href="/2_kings/13-4.htm">2 Kings 13:4&#8211;5</a>), his reign was still marked by the nation&#8217;s continuing idolatry (v. 6). His death signals both personal accountability (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>) and national consequences that will unfold through his descendants (<a href="/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And was buried in Samaria</b><p>&#8220;...and was buried in Samaria&#8221; (13:9 b).<p>&#8226; Samaria, founded by Omri (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>), served as Israel&#8217;s capital. Burial there placed Jehoahaz among the northern kings, underlining his role in that troubled dynasty (<a href="/2_kings/10-35.htm">2 Kings 10:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Royal burials in the capital maintained political legitimacy and cultural identity just as Jerusalem&#8217;s tombs did for Judah&#8217;s kings (<a href="/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of burial grounds the narrative in verifiable geography and history, confirming Scripture&#8217;s accuracy (<a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1&#8211;4</a>). It also foreshadows judgment; Samaria would later fall to Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5&#8211;6</a>), and its royal tombs could not save the nation from covenant curses (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his son Jehoash reigned in his place</b><p>&#8220;And his son Jehoash reigned in his place&#8221; (13:9 c).<p>&#8226; God had promised Jehu, Jehoahaz&#8217;s father, &#8220;Your sons to the fourth generation will sit on the throne of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>). Jehoash (also called Joash) marks generation 3 of that pledge, proving the Lord faithful even when rulers are unfaithful (<a href="/2_timothy/2-13.htm">2 Timothy 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Succession keeps the storyline moving toward God&#8217;s bigger plan: preservation of Israel for the coming Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehoash&#8217;s reign (<a href="/2_kings/13-10.htm">2 Kings 13:10&#8211;13</a>) would mirror some of his father&#8217;s failures, showing that a new administration does not automatically bring spiritual renewal (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). Yet under him the Lord granted military victories through Elisha&#8217;s prophetic ministry (vv. 14&#8211;19), highlighting divine grace in spite of human weakness (<a href="/psalms/103-10.htm">Psalm 103:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;reigned in his place&#8221; underscores personal responsibility: each generation must choose obedience or rebellion (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>). Heritage is a gift, not a guarantee (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/13-9.htm">2 Kings 13:9</a> reports three simple facts&#8212;Jehoahaz died, was buried in Samaria, and his son Jehoash succeeded him&#8212;but each detail carries rich meaning. Death is a real yet temporary rest for God&#8217;s people; burial locations testify to history and impending judgment; dynastic succession showcases God&#8217;s unwavering faithfulness amid human inconsistency. The verse reminds believers today that lives end, legacies continue, and the Lord&#8217;s purposes march on unhindered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Slept with his fathers.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">lay down </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, to sleep) <span class= "ital">like his fathers, i.e.</span>, as his fathers had done before him.
