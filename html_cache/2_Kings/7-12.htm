His rising at night indicates urgency and concern, reflecting the dire situation in Samaria due to the Aramean siege. Nighttime meetings suggest secrecy and the need for immediate action. In biblical narratives, night often symbolizes a time of uncertainty or danger, as seen in other instances like Nicodemus visiting Jesus at night (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>).<p><b>Let me tell you what the Arameans have done to us</b><br>The Arameans, also known as Syrians, were frequent adversaries of Israel. The king's statement reflects a deep-seated mistrust and fear of their tactics. Historically, the Arameans were known for their military strategies and psychological warfare, which often involved deception. This context is crucial for understanding the king's suspicion.<p><b>They know we are starving</b><br>The famine in Samaria was severe, as described earlier in <a href="/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a>, where a donkey's head and dove's dung were sold at exorbitant prices. This dire situation fulfills the curses warned in <a href="/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>, where disobedience to God would lead to such desperate conditions. The king's acknowledgment of their starvation highlights the desperation and vulnerability of the city.<p><b>so they have left the camp to hide in the field</b><br>The king suspects a ruse, a common military tactic where an army feigns retreat to lure the enemy into a trap. This reflects the cunning strategies often employed in ancient warfare. The fields around Samaria would have provided ample cover for such an ambush, aligning with the geographical realities of the region.<p><b>thinking, &#8216;When they come out of the city, we will take them alive and enter the city.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The king fears that the Arameans plan to capture the Israelites alive, which would allow them to enter and conquer the city without a prolonged siege. This reflects the brutal realities of ancient warfare, where capturing a city often involved taking its inhabitants as prisoners or slaves. The king's suspicion underscores the tension and fear within the besieged city, as well as the cunning and ruthlessness attributed to the Arameans. This scenario also highlights the broader biblical theme of deliverance and trust in God's provision, as the subsequent verses reveal the miraculous provision that God provides for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>Likely King Jehoram, who was ruling during the time of the Aramean siege of Samaria.

He supposed that the enemy had merely gone a little way from their camp, and placed themselves in ambush, ready to take ad- vantage of any rash movement which the Israelites might make.
