In the cultural context of ancient Israel, hospitality was a significant virtue, and Elisha's desire to reciprocate reflects the importance of gratitude and blessing those who bless others. This mirrors the biblical principle found in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises to bless those who bless His people.<p><b>&#8220;Well, she has no son,&#8221; Gehazi replied,</b><br>Gehazi, Elisha's servant, identifies the woman's lack of a son as a significant issue. In the historical and cultural context of ancient Israel, having a son was crucial for a family's legacy and security. Sons were seen as a blessing from God (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>) and were essential for carrying on the family name and providing for parents in their old age. This situation echoes the stories of other biblical women, such as Sarah, Rebekah, and Hannah, who also faced barrenness and were later blessed with children.<p><b>&#8220;and her husband is old.&#8221;</b><br>The mention of the husband's age highlights the improbability of the couple having children naturally, setting the stage for a miraculous intervention. This detail parallels the story of Abraham and Sarah in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, where Sarah's advanced age made the promise of a son seem impossible. Such instances in Scripture often serve as a type of divine intervention, showcasing God's power to fulfill His promises against all odds. This also foreshadows the miraculous birth of Jesus Christ, born to the Virgin Mary, emphasizing God's ability to bring life where it seems impossible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah.

Having already received generous hospitality from the Shunammite woman (<a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8&#8211;10</a>), he initiates a follow-up conversation through his servant Gehazi.<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s question shows pastoral concern; he isn&#8217;t satisfied merely to enjoy her kindness but seeks a tangible way to bless her (cf. <a href="/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Elisha&#8217;s inquiry also underscores a principle woven through Scripture: God&#8217;s servants look for opportunities to return kindness (<a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>).<p>&#8226; The straightforward narrative reminds us that God often uses ordinary dialogue to unfold His extraordinary plans (<a href="/genesis/24-12.htm">Genesis 24:12&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Then what should be done for her?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Elisha&#8217;s openness invites collaboration. He doesn&#8217;t presume to know the woman&#8217;s deepest need; instead, he listens (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrasing echoes the Lord&#8217;s own pattern of asking questions to draw out faith and reveal hearts (<a href="/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/mark/10-51.htm">Mark 10:51</a>).<p>&#8226; By seeking insight from Gehazi, Elisha models leadership that values counsel (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The question sets the stage for divine intervention, illustrating that God often precedes miracles with an honest assessment of need (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Well, she has no son,&#8221; Gehazi replied,</b><p>&#8226; Gehazi identifies a cultural and personal void. In ancient Israel, childlessness carried social stigma and threatened a family&#8217;s future inheritance (<a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The servant&#8217;s observation reveals attentiveness; he has noticed what Elisha and perhaps the woman herself have not verbalized (<a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Scriptural pattern: God repeatedly steps into barren situations&#8212;Sarah (<a href="/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10</a>), Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/25-21.htm">Genesis 25:21</a>), Rachel (<a href="/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22</a>), Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19&#8211;20</a>), Elizabeth (<a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>)&#8212;to showcase His sovereign power.<p>&#8226; Gehazi&#8217;s statement quietly signals hope: the God who opened wombs before is about to do it again (<a href="/psalms/113-9.htm">Psalm 113:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and her husband is old.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Gehazi notes a human impossibility, heightening the miracle&#8217;s significance. An aging couple lacking an heir parallels Abraham and Sarah (<a href="/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail emphasizes that, from a natural standpoint, the window for bearing children has closed (<a href="/ecclesiastes/11-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Such circumstances invite faith grounded in God&#8217;s ability, not in human strength (<a href="/luke/1-34.htm">Luke 1:34&#8211;37</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase prepares the reader for the prophetic promise in the following verses (<a href="/2_kings/4-16.htm">2 Kings 4:16</a>), displaying the pattern that God&#8217;s power is made perfect where human resources are spent (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/4-14.htm">2 Kings 4:14</a> captures a pivotal moment of compassionate inquiry, insightful observation, and human impossibility. Elisha&#8217;s desire to bless, Gehazi&#8217;s perceptive reply, and the couple&#8217;s childless, aged condition together form the backdrop for a miracle that affirms God&#8217;s faithfulness to honor generosity and to overcome natural limitations. The verse reminds us that God sees hidden needs, invites His servants to participate in meeting them, and delights to demonstrate His power where hope seems gone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">And he said</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, when Gehazi had reported the woman's reply.<p><span class= "bld">She hath no child.</span>--Which was at once a misfortune and a reproach.

Has he heard her express any wish? Does he know of any boon that would be welcome to her? Evidently the woman's disinterestedness has increased the prophet's desire to do something for her. b It does not appear that the woman had made any complaint or exhibited any special anxiety on the subject of offspring. But Gehazi knows, that to be barren is regarded by all Hebrew women as a re-preach, that it exposes them to scorn and contumely (<a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6, 7</a>), and that offspring is universally, or all but universally, desired. He therefore assumes that the Shunammite must wish for it.
