This moment occurs during a conversation between Hazael and the prophet Elisha. Hazael, a high-ranking official in the Aramean army, is unaware of the prophecy concerning his rise to power and the subsequent violence he will inflict. This question also highlights the cultural practice of showing respect to prophets, as Hazael refers to Elisha as "my lord."<p><b>&#8220;Because I know the evil you will do to the Israelites,&#8221; Elisha replied.</b><br>Elisha's response indicates his prophetic insight into future events. As a prophet, Elisha is given knowledge by God about the forthcoming suffering of Israel at the hands of Hazael. This statement underscores the role of prophets in the Old Testament as messengers of God's will and foreknowledge. The mention of "evil" reflects the moral and spiritual decline that will accompany Hazael's actions, aligning with the biblical theme of judgment against nations that oppose God's people.<p><b>&#8220;You will set fire to their fortresses,</b><br>This phrase predicts the destruction of Israel's strongholds, a common military tactic in ancient warfare aimed at weakening a nation's defenses. The burning of fortresses signifies not only physical destruction but also the loss of security and stability for the Israelites. Historically, this aligns with the aggressive expansion of the Aramean kingdom under Hazael's rule, as recorded in other biblical passages and corroborated by archaeological findings of destroyed sites in the region.<p><b>kill their young men with the sword,</b><br>The killing of young men represents the decimation of Israel's future generation and military strength. In ancient cultures, young men were often the primary defenders of their communities. This prophecy highlights the brutality of Hazael's campaigns and the severe impact on Israel's population. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of divine judgment through warfare, as seen in other instances where God allows foreign nations to discipline Israel.<p><b>dash their little ones to pieces,</b><br>This graphic imagery conveys the extreme violence and inhumanity of Hazael's future actions. The dashing of children is a particularly heinous act, emphasizing the totality of the destruction and the depth of suffering that will be inflicted upon Israel. Such acts were not uncommon in ancient Near Eastern warfare, where total annihilation was sometimes pursued to instill fear and ensure dominance.<p><b>and rip open their pregnant women.&#8221;</b><br>The mention of pregnant women being ripped open is a shocking depiction of cruelty and serves as a symbol of the utter devastation that will befall Israel. This act not only represents the loss of life but also the destruction of future generations. It underscores the severity of the judgment prophesied by Elisha and serves as a stark warning of the consequences of turning away from God. This prophecy is fulfilled in the subsequent chapters, illustrating the accuracy of Elisha's words and the unfolding of God's sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah.

Each vivid phrase unveils God&#8217;s foreknowledge, Israel&#8217;s coming discipline for persistent sin, and the compassionate sorrow of a prophet who shares God&#8217;s heart. The verse warns that when a people abandon the Lord, even their defenses, warriors, and children become vulnerable. Yet it also affirms God&#8217;s sovereignty over history and His promise to judge evil perfectly. The study calls believers to heed divine warnings, remain faithful, and mirror Elisha&#8217;s tear-filled compassion for those facing judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">The evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel.</span>--Fulfilled in <a href="/context/2_kings/10-32.htm" title="In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;">2Kings 10:32-33</a>; <a href="/context/2_kings/13-3.htm" title="And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.">2Kings 13:3-4</a>.
