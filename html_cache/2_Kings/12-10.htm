The chest was placed by the altar to collect offerings for temple repairs, a practice initiated by King Joash. The presence of a large amount of money suggests the people's willingness to contribute to the temple's upkeep, highlighting the importance of the temple in Israelite society. This practice can be compared to the collection of offerings in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>, where Paul instructs the church to set aside money for the saints.<p><b>the royal scribe and the high priest would go up</b><br>The involvement of both the royal scribe and the high priest underscores the collaboration between the monarchy and the priesthood in managing temple affairs. The royal scribe, a government official, ensured transparency and accountability, while the high priest represented religious authority. This partnership reflects the theocratic nature of Israel, where religious and political spheres were intertwined. The high priest's role is significant, as he was the spiritual leader of Israel, a position that foreshadows the ultimate high priest, Jesus Christ, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>.<p><b>count the money brought into the house of the LORD</b><br>Counting the money was a meticulous process to ensure integrity in handling the funds. The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. This practice of counting and recording offerings is echoed in the New Testament, where financial stewardship is emphasized, such as in <a href="/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34-35</a>, where the early church managed communal resources. The temple's maintenance was crucial for the Israelites, as it was the dwelling place of God's presence among His people.<p><b>and tie it up in bags</b><br>Tying the money in bags was a practical method for securing and transporting the funds. This detail highlights the organized approach to temple administration. The use of bags for money is also seen in other biblical contexts, such as in the parable of the talents in <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>, where servants are entrusted with bags of gold.

And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them on two of his servants; and they bore them before him.">2Kings 5:23</a>.) Instead of "they bound up," Ewald prefers the word used in Chronicles, "they emptied," which is very similar in Hebrew writing.

Such persons are seen on the Assyrian sculptured slabs, with a roll of paper or parchment in one hand, and a pen in the other, taking account for the king of the spoil brought in from foreign countries (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 86). <span class="cmt_word">And the high priest.</span> Since the time of Joshua, the high priest had been called simply "the priest." The restoration of the full title (<span class="accented">hae-cohen hag-gadol</span>) marks the increasing power of the priests and the diminishing power of the kings under the later monarchy. <span class="cmt_word">Came up, and they put up in bags, and told, the money that was found in the house of the Lord.</span> Money was ordinarily put up in bags, containing a certain definite amount, the mouth of the bag being then tied round with a string (see <a href="/2_kings/5-23.htm">2 Kings 5:23</a>; and comp. <a href="/proverbs/7-20.htm">Proverbs 7:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6</a>; <a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>).
