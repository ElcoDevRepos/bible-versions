Elisha, having recently succeeded Elijah, is approached by the city's men, indicating their recognition of his prophetic authority. Jericho, a city with a storied past, was the first city conquered by the Israelites under Joshua (Joshua 6). Its walls famously fell after the Israelites marched around them, and it was cursed by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/6-26.htm">Joshua 6:26</a>). The approach of the men to Elisha suggests a respect for prophetic intervention in their plight.<p><b>&#8220;Please note, our lord,</b><br>The use of "our lord" reflects a term of respect and acknowledgment of Elisha's spiritual authority. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, prophets were seen as God's representatives, and addressing Elisha in this manner shows the men's deference and hope for divine assistance through him.<p><b>that the city&#8217;s location is good, as you can see.</b><br>Jericho's location was indeed strategic and beneficial. Situated near the Jordan River and the Dead Sea, it was a fertile area, often referred to as the "City of Palms" (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>). The acknowledgment of the city's good location highlights the irony of its current predicament, where despite its advantageous position, it suffers from a critical problem.<p><b>But the water is bad</b><br>The problem of bad water is significant, as water is essential for life, agriculture, and prosperity. The "bad" water could refer to its undrinkability or its inability to support agriculture. This issue may be linked to the curse pronounced by Joshua, which could have had lingering effects on the land (<a href="/joshua/6-26.htm">Joshua 6:26</a>). The bad water symbolizes spiritual barrenness and the need for divine intervention to restore life and productivity.<p><b>and the land is unfruitful.&#8221;</b><br>The unfruitfulness of the land is a direct consequence of the bad water. In biblical symbolism, fruitfulness often represents God's blessing and favor, while barrenness signifies judgment or curse. The unfruitful land of Jericho contrasts with its potential due to its location. This situation sets the stage for a miraculous intervention, foreshadowing the redemptive work of Christ, who brings life and restoration. The request for help from Elisha points to the need for divine grace to overcome the effects of sin and curse, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet and successor of Elijah, known for performing miracles and guiding the people of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_the_city.htm">Men of the City</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Jericho who approach Elisha with their concern about the water.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_of_jericho.htm">City of Jericho</a></b><br>An ancient city with a strategic location, known for its historical significance and the miraculous fall of its walls during Joshua's time.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bad_water.htm">Bad Water</a></b><br>The water source in Jericho was contaminated, leading to unfruitfulness in the land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/unfruitful_land.htm">Unfruitful Land</a></b><br>The result of the bad water, causing the land to be barren and unable to support agriculture or life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_spiritual_leadership.htm">The Importance of Spiritual Leadership</a></b><br>Elisha's role as a prophet highlights the need for godly leaders who can address both spiritual and practical needs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_power_to_transform.htm">God's Power to Transform</a></b><br>Just as God used Elisha to purify the water, He can transform our lives and circumstances, turning barrenness into fruitfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin_and_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Sin and Disobedience</a></b><br>The unfruitfulness of Jericho serves as a reminder of the long-term effects of sin and the importance of seeking God's forgiveness and restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The men of Jericho demonstrated faith by approaching Elisha, showing that we must actively seek God's intervention in our challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_symbolism_of_water_in_scripture.htm">The Symbolism of Water in Scripture</a></b><br>Water often symbolizes life, cleansing, and renewal in the Bible, pointing to the spiritual refreshment found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_2_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 2:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_2_19_God_s_power_to_transform.htm">How does 2 Kings 2:19 demonstrate God's power to transform difficult situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Faith_s_role_in_solutions_2_Kings_2_19.htm">What role does faith play in seeking solutions, as seen in 2 Kings 2:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Elisha_s_response_to_challenges.htm">How can we apply Elisha's response to challenges in our own lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Biblical_examples_of_God_s_solutions_2.htm">What other biblical examples show God providing solutions to seemingly impossible problems?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_2_19_Trust_God_s_timing.htm">How does 2 Kings 2:19 encourage us to trust God's provision and timing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_2_19_God_s_power_to_heal.htm">How does 2 Kings 2:19 demonstrate God's power to transform and heal?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Elisha_s_role_in_2_Kings_2_19.htm">What is the significance of Elisha's role in 2 Kings 2:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_2_19_God_s_care_for_needs.htm">How does 2 Kings 2:19 reflect God's concern for human needs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_kings_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Kings 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_events_are_described_in_2_kings.htm">What events are described in 2 Kings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/can_wood_make_bitter_water_drinkable.htm">In Exodus 15:23&#8211;25, how could throwing a piece of wood into bitter water make it potable, and is there any historical or scientific basis for this claim?

Third, every visible problem&#8212;bad water, unfruitful land&#8212;traces to deeper spiritual causes that only God can heal.

Lying on a broad plain which is traversed by an abundant river, at the point where one of the main wadys debouched from the Judaean upland upon the low country, shaded by groves of palm trees (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>) and fig-mulberries (<a href="/luke/19-4.htm">Luke 19:4</a>), the air scented with aromatic shrubs, opobalsam, myroba-lanum, and the like, facing the Orient sun, and commanding a wide prospect both across and also up and down the Ghor, with the mountains of Moab in the distance, Jericho was, no doubt, even before the miracle of Elisha, a "pleasant" place. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> - there was one drawback - <span class="cmt_word">the water is naught, and the ground barren.</span> Bitter and brackish springs, of which there are many in the Jordan valley, gushed forth from the foot of the mountains, and formed rivulets, which ran across the plain towards the Jordan, not diffusing health and fertility, but rather disease and barrenness.

It was the prayer of the men of Jericho that Elisha would remove this inconvenience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/2-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;an&#183;&#353;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the city</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
