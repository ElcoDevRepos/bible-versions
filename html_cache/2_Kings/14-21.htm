This reflects a common practice in ancient Israel where the people played a role in affirming the king, as seen in the anointing of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a>) and David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>). Azariah, also known as Uzziah, is a significant figure in Judah's history, and his reign is noted for prosperity and military success (<a href="/2_chronicles/26.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1-15</a>). The name Azariah means "Yahweh has helped," which may reflect the people's hope for divine favor under his rule.<p><b>who was sixteen years old</b><br>Azariah's young age at his ascension is noteworthy. In the ancient Near East, it was not uncommon for young individuals to become rulers, often under the guidance of regents or advisors. His youth may have required him to rely heavily on experienced counselors, which could have influenced his early reign. This detail also highlights the vulnerability and potential for growth in his leadership, as seen in other young kings like Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22:1</a>).<p><b>and made him king in place of his father Amaziah</b><br>Amaziah's reign ended in turmoil, as he was assassinated following a military defeat and subsequent idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/14-17.htm">2 Kings 14:17-20</a>). The transition to Azariah's rule marks a new chapter for Judah, with the hope of stability and renewal. The phrase "in place of his father" underscores the dynastic continuity, a critical aspect of the Davidic line, which is central to biblical prophecy concerning the Messiah (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Azariah's reign is a type of Christ in that he restores and strengthens the kingdom, prefiguring the ultimate restoration through Jesus, the true King from David's line.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah.htm">Azariah (Uzziah)</a></b><br>Azariah, also known as Uzziah, was made king of Judah at the age of sixteen.

The nation moves as one, indicating both consensus and urgency. Earlier reforms had rallied the populace around covenant faithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-16.htm">2 Chronicles 23:16</a>), and now they act corporately again. This unity recalls how Israel gathered to make David king (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1&#8211;3</a>) and how Judah restored the Davidic heir Joash (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1&#8211;3</a>). Their collective resolve shows:<p>&#8226; God often works through the united agreement of His people (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The line of David remains a shared conviction, not merely a royal preference (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>took Azariah</b><p>The wording suggests deliberate choice&#8212;&#8220;took&#8221; rather than &#8220;happened upon.&#8221; Just as the elders &#8220;took&#8221; David from Hebron (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>) and the people &#8220;took&#8221; Josiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-1.htm">2 Chronicles 34:1</a>), Judah intentionally embraces God&#8217;s covenant plan.

Though reserving his account of the reign of Azariah to the next chapter (vers. 1-7), the writer is led by the circumstances of Amaziah's death to mention <span class="accented">at once</span> the fact of his son Azariah's succession, and the first important act of his reign, the resumption of war with Edom. He then breaks off suddenly, in order to interpose an account of the reign of Jeroboam II., who was contemporary with Amaziah during fourteen years of his reign, <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the people of Judah took Azariah.</span> This is a new expression, and implies a new, perhaps a tumultuary, proceeding. The <span class="accented">people</span>, uncertain probably of the intentions of the conspirators, and fearful that they might set up a king not of the house of David, took the initiative, went to the royal palace, and finding there a son of Amaziah - whether his eldest son or not, we cannot say - proclaimed him king and placed him upon the throne. The author of Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1</a>) agrees. Josephus is silent. <span class="cmt_word">Which was sixteen years old.</span> Young certainly, considering that his father was fifty-four (see ver. 2), but not necessarily "a younger son," since Amaziah's earlier children may have been daughters, or he may have married late in life.

The difference between them is not so great in the Hebrew, where they both begin with the same letter; but still it is considerable. One name is not a mere contraction of the other. Some suppose that the king changed one name for the other upon his accession; others, that he was called indifferently by either, since they were very similar in meaning. "Azariah" is "he whose help is Jehovah;" "Uzziah," "he whose strength is Jehovah." "Uzziah" is the predominant form, occurring four times in 2 Kings, twelve times in 2 Chronicles, three times in Isaiah, once in Hoses, once in Amos, and once in Zechariah; while "Azariah" occurs only in 2 Kings (eight times) and in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-12.htm">1 Chronicles 3:12</a> (once). Josephus uses the form "Ozias" (equivalent to, Uzziah), and so does St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/1-8.htm">Matthew 1:8, 9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/14-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Judah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3063.htm">Strong's 3063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Judah -- 'praised', a son of Jacob, also the southern kingdom, also four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1495;&#1438;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
