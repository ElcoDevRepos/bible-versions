The use of a chariot for transportation signifies his royal status. Jerusalem, the capital city, holds significant importance as the political and spiritual center of Israel. It is the city where the temple built by Solomon stood, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The act of carrying Ahaziah to Jerusalem reflects the practice of ensuring that kings were buried in a manner befitting their status.<p><b>and buried him with his fathers</b><br>This phrase highlights the tradition of burying kings in familial tombs, a practice that underscores the importance of lineage and heritage in ancient Israel. Being buried "with his fathers" signifies continuity and connection to the Davidic line, which is crucial in biblical history as it relates to the messianic prophecies concerning the lineage of David. This burial practice also reflects the cultural emphasis on honoring one's ancestors and maintaining family ties even in death.<p><b>in his tomb in the City of David</b><br>The City of David refers to the oldest settled area of Jerusalem, named after King David, who established it as his capital. This location is significant as it connects Ahaziah to the legacy of David, the revered king of Israel. The mention of "his tomb" suggests a specific burial place prepared for him, indicating the care taken to preserve the royal lineage. The City of David is archaeologically significant, with numerous discoveries shedding light on the period of the united monarchy and the early history of Jerusalem. This connection to David's city reinforces the legitimacy and continuity of the Davidic dynasty, which is central to the biblical narrative and the anticipation of the Messiah, who is prophesied to come from David's line.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaziah.htm">Ahaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who was killed by Jehu.
