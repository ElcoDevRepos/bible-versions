The secrecy suggests a recognition of wrongdoing, yet a willful persistence in sin. This behavior is reminiscent of Adam and Eve hiding from God in <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>. The Israelites' actions violated the covenant established at Sinai (Exodus 19-24), where they were commanded to worship the LORD alone. Their secretive actions reflect a heart turned away from God, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which speaks of the deceitfulness of the heart. This disobedience ultimately led to the Assyrian exile, fulfilling the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>.<p><b>From watchtower to fortified city,</b><br>This phrase indicates the widespread nature of the Israelites' idolatry, covering the entire land from rural outposts to major urban centers. Watchtowers were used for agricultural oversight and defense, while fortified cities were centers of power and security. The phrase suggests that no part of the land was free from idolatry, echoing the pervasive sin described in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>. The geographical spread of idolatry underscores the systemic nature of Israel's rebellion against God, which was not limited to isolated incidents but was a national issue.<p><b>they built high places in all their cities.</b><br>High places were elevated sites used for worship, often associated with pagan rituals and deities. Despite God's command to destroy such places (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>), the Israelites constructed them throughout their cities, indicating a direct violation of divine law. These high places became centers of syncretism, where the worship of Yahweh was mixed with Canaanite practices, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>. The construction of high places reflects a departure from centralized worship in Jerusalem, as prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>, and symbolizes the spiritual adultery of Israel. This idolatry is a type of the ultimate rejection of God, which finds its resolution in Christ, who is the true temple and the fulfillment of all worship (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were expected to follow His commandments and live according to His statutes.

The people imagined they could keep idolatry under wraps, but the omniscient God saw it all. Secrecy here speaks to deliberate concealment, not accidental misstep. When believers today toy with private sins, this line reminds us that the God who &#8220;searches hearts and minds&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>) is never fooled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Against the LORD their God</b><p>Their secret deeds were not merely personal lapses; they were directed &#8220;against&#8221; the covenant God who had redeemed them (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2-3</a>). Rebellion against the Lord is always personal because He has revealed Himself and entered covenant with His people. Each act of idolatry constituted spiritual adultery (<a href="/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>). By specifying &#8220;their God,&#8221; the text underscores relationship&#8212;they sinned against the very One who owned and loved them (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That were not right</b><p>Scripture sets an objective moral standard. What they did was &#8220;not right,&#8221; full stop (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-8.htm">Deuteronomy 12:8, 28</a>). The phrase rules out relativism: righteousness is defined by God, not by the surrounding culture of Assyria or Canaan. Even if society applauds certain practices, God&#8217;s verdict stands. For contemporary readers, this clause calls us to measure actions by God&#8217;s Word rather than shifting opinion (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From watchtower to fortified city</b><p>This expression pictures the entire landscape&#8212;from the smallest outpost to the largest stronghold. Their compromise was thorough; no corner of Israelite life remained untouched. Compare the pervasiveness of sin in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a> or <a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>. The text warns that unchecked sin spreads until it occupies every sphere, from private thought to public institution.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They built high places in all their cities</b><p>High places were local shrines where people blended worship of Yahweh with pagan rituals (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31-33</a>). Building them &#8220;in all their cities&#8221; shows systematic, organized apostasy (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-24.htm">2 Chronicles 28:24-25</a>). Idolatry became normalized, even convenient. Today, the temptation works similarly: create easy, culturally acceptable substitutes for wholehearted obedience (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/17-9.htm">2 Kings 17:9</a> reveals a people who thought hidden sin was harmless, yet they were openly rebelling against their covenant Lord. Their actions were objectively wrong, spread everywhere, and institutionalized idolatry. God&#8217;s all-seeing eye, His exclusive claim on His people, and His unchanging standard all stand out. Modern believers are called to forsake secrecy, confront wrong, and keep every &#8220;city&#8221;&#8212;every part of life&#8212;free from rival gods.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Did secretly.</span>--The literal sense is <span class= "ital">covered.</span> In this connection it is natural to remember that Heb. verbs of <span class= "ital">covering</span> and <span class= "ital">hiding</span> are often used in the sense of dealing <span class= "ital">perfidiously</span> or <span class= "ital">deceitfully.</span> (Comp. <span class= "ital">m?'al,</span> l Chron. 10:13, with <span class= "ital">me'il,</span> "mantle;" and <span class= "ital">b?gad,</span> "to deal treacherously," <a href="/hosea/5-7.htm" title="They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.">Hosea 5:7</a>, with <span class= "ital">beged,</span> "garment.")
