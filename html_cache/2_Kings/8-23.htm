His reign is noted for its departure from the ways of his father, as he led Judah into idolatry and formed alliances with the house of Ahab through marriage. This phrase suggests that Jehoram's reign included significant events and actions not detailed in this passage, indicating a broader historical context that would have been familiar to the original audience.<p><b>along with all his accomplishments</b><br>Jehoram's accomplishments, from a historical perspective, include his military campaigns and political maneuvers. However, his reign is often viewed negatively due to his spiritual failures and the resulting consequences for Judah. His accomplishments might have included fortifying cities or engaging in battles, but these are overshadowed by his spiritual decline and the introduction of Baal worship.<p><b>are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><br>This phrase refers to a historical record that chronicled the reigns of the kings of Judah. While this specific book is not part of the biblical canon, it suggests that detailed records were kept, similar to the biblical books of 1 and 2 Chronicles. This reference underscores the importance of historical documentation in ancient Israel and Judah, providing a fuller picture of Jehoram's reign beyond the biblical narrative.
