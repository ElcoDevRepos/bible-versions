This trust is demonstrated through his actions, such as the removal of high places, breaking the bronze serpent, and his reforms to restore proper worship (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>). The phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where trust in God is paramount. Hezekiah's faith is reminiscent of the trust shown by David, his ancestor, and is a model for believers. His reliance on God is further exemplified during the Assyrian siege, where he sought divine intervention through prayer (<a href="/2_kings/19-14.htm">2 Kings 19:14-19</a>).<p><b>No king of Judah was like him, either before him or after him.</b><br>This statement emphasizes Hezekiah's unique devotion and faithfulness among the kings of Judah. It highlights his unparalleled commitment to God, setting him apart from his predecessors and successors. Historically, Hezekiah's reign is marked by significant religious reforms and a return to the worship of Yahweh, contrasting with the idolatry that plagued Judah. His leadership during the Assyrian threat and his efforts to centralize worship in Jerusalem reflect his dedication. This phrase also points to the messianic hope, as Hezekiah's righteous rule foreshadows the ultimate kingship of Jesus Christ, who perfectly embodies trust and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned during a time of significant reform and revival.

This was exactly what God required as the condition on which he would give his aid (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-7</a>), and what no previous king since the Assyrian troubles began could bring himself to do. <span class="cmt_word">So that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.</span> It has been concluded from this statement that, "when the merits of the kings were summed up after the fall of the monarchy, Hezekiah was, by a deliberate judgment, put at the very top" (Stanley 'Lectures on the Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 397); but, as exactly the same words are used of Josiah in <a href="/2_kings/23-25.htm">2 Kings 23:25</a>, the true conclusion would seem to be rather that Hezekiah and Josiah were selected from the rest, and placed upon a par, above all the others. At first sight there may seem to be contradiction between the two passages, since absolute pre-eminence over <span class="accented">all</span> the other kings is ascribed to Hezekiah in one of them, to Josiah in the other; but the context shows that the pre-eminence is not the same in the two cases. To Hezekiah is ascribed pre-eminence in <span class="accented">trust</span>; to Josiah, pre-eminence in an exact observance of the Law: one excels in faith, the other in works; Josiah's whole life is one of activity, Hezekiah's great merit lies in his being content, in the crisis of his fate, to "stand still, and see the salvation of God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/18-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Hezekiah trusted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1425;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#7789;&#257;&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_982.htm">Strong's 982: </a> </span><span class="str2">To trust, be confident, sure</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
