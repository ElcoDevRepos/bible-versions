This act of standing before his master signifies a position of accountability and service. In biblical times, a servant standing before a master was a common practice, indicating readiness to serve or report. Gehazi's role as a servant is reminiscent of other biblical figures who served prophets, such as Elisha himself who served Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-21.htm">1 Kings 19:21</a>). This setting underscores the hierarchical relationship and the expectation of honesty and integrity in service.<p><b>Elisha asked him, &#8220;Gehazi, where have you been?&#8221;</b><br>Elisha's question is direct and probing, reflecting his role as a prophet who discerns truth. This inquiry is similar to God's question to Adam in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>, "Where are you?" which seeks to reveal the truth of one's actions and heart. Elisha's prophetic insight likely already knows Gehazi's actions, and the question serves to give Gehazi an opportunity to confess. This moment highlights the theme of accountability before God and His representatives.<p><b>&#8220;Your servant did not go anywhere,&#8221; he replied.</b><br>Gehazi's response is a blatant lie, demonstrating his attempt to conceal his wrongdoing. This lie is significant as it contrasts with the expected truthfulness of a servant of a prophet. The act of lying is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>, "Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD." Gehazi's deceit is a moral failure that leads to severe consequences, illustrating the biblical principle that sin often leads to further sin and eventual judgment. This moment foreshadows Gehazi's punishment and serves as a warning against dishonesty and greed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gehazi.htm">Gehazi</a></b><br>The servant of Elisha, who becomes central in this account due to his deceitful actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/naaman.htm">Naaman</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, he is the Syrian commander whose healing from leprosy sets the stage for Gehazi's actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The setting of this event, where Elisha's ministry takes place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>Gehazi's deceitful pursuit of Naaman to obtain gifts under false pretenses, leading to this confrontation with Elisha.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_deceit.htm">The Consequences of Deceit</a></b><br>Gehazi's lie to Elisha serves as a warning about the spiritual and practical consequences of deceit.

His denial seals his fate, illustrating that no lie can outwit the all-seeing Lord.
