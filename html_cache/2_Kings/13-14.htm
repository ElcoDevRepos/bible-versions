His illness signifies the natural end of his earthly ministry, highlighting the mortality of even God's chosen servants. Elisha's life was marked by numerous miracles, and his impending death marks the end of an era for Israel. This moment underscores the transition from one prophetic voice to another, as God&#8217;s work continues beyond individual lifespans. The illness also serves as a reminder of the human condition and the inevitability of death, even for those who are close to God.<p><b>Jehoash king of Israel came down to him</b><br>Jehoash, also known as Joash, was the king of the northern kingdom of Israel. His visit to Elisha indicates the prophet's significant influence and respect, even among the monarchy. Despite the often strained relationship between Israel's kings and God's prophets, Jehoash's action shows a recognition of Elisha's authority and the divine power associated with him. This visit also reflects the political and spiritual climate of Israel, where the king seeks guidance and reassurance from the prophet during a time of national distress.<p><b>and wept over him</b><br>The king's weeping demonstrates a deep respect and perhaps a sense of loss for the guidance and protection Elisha provided. It reflects the human emotion and vulnerability of a leader facing the loss of a spiritual mentor. This act of mourning can be seen as an acknowledgment of the void that Elisha's death would create in the spiritual and political landscape of Israel.<p><b>saying, &#8220;My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase echoes the words Elisha himself used when Elijah was taken up to heaven (<a href="/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>). It signifies the recognition of Elisha as a spiritual father and protector of Israel, akin to a military force. The "chariots and horsemen" symbolize divine protection and strength, suggesting that Elisha's presence was seen as a source of security for the nation. This expression highlights the belief that the true power and defense of Israel lie not in military might but in the presence and guidance of God's prophets. It also foreshadows the continued need for divine intervention and leadership in Israel's future.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for performing miracles and guiding the kings of Israel.

Elisha&#8217;s terminal illness underscores human frailty, Jehoash&#8217;s visit and tears reveal respect and dependence, and the repeated cry about &#8220;chariots and horsemen&#8221; proclaims that spiritual forces, marshaled by God through His servants, are the true strength of God&#8217;s people. The verse challenges every generation to honor God-given leadership, to seek divine protection rather than human might, and to trust the Lord who remains steadfast even when His servants pass from the scene.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14-21) The visit of Joash to the dying Elisha.<p>This section is obviously derived from another documentary source than the preceding.

The prophet, by his teaching and his prayers, as well as by his sage counsel and wonder-working powers, had been more to Israel than chariots and horsemen. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Elisha, was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died.</span> Elisha, who was grown to manhood before the death of Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>), must have been at least eighty years old at the accession of Joash: His illness was therefore probably the result of mere natural decay. <span class="cmt_word">And Joash the King of Israel came down unto him.</span> The visit of a king to a prophet, in the way of sympathy and compliment, would be a very unusual occurrence at any period of the world's history. In the East, and at the period of which the historian is treating, it was probably unprecedented. Prophets waited upon kings, not kings upon prophets: If a king came to a prophet's house, it was likely to be on an errand of vengeance (<a href="/2_kings/6-32.htm">2 Kings 6:32</a>), not on one of kindness and sympathy. The act of Joash certainly implies a degree of tenderness and consideration on its part very uncommon at the time, and is a fact to which much weight should be attached in any estimate that we form of his character. He was, at any rate, a prince of an amiable disposition. <span class="cmt_word">And wept over his face</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, leant over the sick man as he lay on his bed, and shed tears, some of which fell on him - <span class="cmt_word">and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.</span> As Elisha had addressed Elijah, when he was quitting the earth (<a href="/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>), so Joash now addressed the dying Elisha, using exactly the same words, not (certainly) by a mere coincidence. Joash must have known the circumstances of Elijah's departure, which had probably been entered before this in the 'Book of the Kings,' and intended pointedly to allude to them. "O my father, my father," he meant to say, "when Elijah was taken from the earth, thou didst exclaim that the defense of Israel was gone" (see the comment on 2 Kings 2:12): "how much more must it be true that it is gone now, when thou art on the point of departure! He left thee as his successor; thou leavest no one!" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/13-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Elisha</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1462;&#1469;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(we&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
