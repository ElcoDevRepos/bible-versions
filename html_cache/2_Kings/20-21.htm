Hezekiah was one of the few kings of Judah who was noted for his faithfulness to God, as seen in his efforts to restore proper worship and his reliance on God during the Assyrian siege. The phrase "rested with his fathers" suggests a peaceful death and burial in the royal tombs, a sign of honor and continuity with his ancestors. This expression is used throughout the Old Testament to denote the death of a king, emphasizing the continuity of the Davidic line, which is significant in biblical prophecy concerning the Messiah.<p><b>and his son Manasseh reigned in his place</b><br>Manasseh's ascension to the throne marks a significant shift in the spiritual and political landscape of Judah. Unlike his father, Manasseh is known for his idolatry and leading Judah into sin, as detailed in the subsequent chapters. His reign is one of the longest in Judah's history, lasting 55 years, and is characterized by the reintroduction of pagan practices and the persecution of the faithful. This transition highlights the recurring theme of the cyclical nature of faithfulness and apostasy in Israel's history. Manasseh's reign is also a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God, as prophesied in the Mosaic Covenant. Despite his initial rebellion, Manasseh's later repentance (as recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/33.htm">2 Chronicles 33</a>) serves as a powerful example of God's mercy and the possibility of redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>Hezekiah was the king of Judah known for his faithfulness to God, his reforms to restore proper worship, and his reliance on God during the Assyrian siege.

It signals both physical death and a confident expectation of being gathered to the covenant people who died before him (<a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Hezekiah&#8217;s death closes a remarkable life of trust in the LORD. He had &#8220;trusted in the LORD&#8230; so that there was none like him among all the kings of Judah&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5-6</a>). His faith was proven in prayer when God added fifteen years to his life (<a href="/2_kings/20-5.htm">2 Kings 20:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also hints at the believer&#8217;s rest after earthly toil (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>). For Hezekiah, a king who faced Assyrian threats and personal illness, death meant release into God&#8217;s care (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Burial among the royal tombs (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-33.htm">2 Chronicles 32:33</a>) publicly affirmed both honor and the enduring line of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Manasseh reigned in his place</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and his son Manasseh reigned in his place.&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/20-21.htm">2 Kings 20:21</a>)<p>&#8226; The seamless succession underscores God&#8217;s promise that &#8220;your house and your kingdom will endure before Me forever&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Even when individual kings fail, the covenant line continues toward the promised Messiah (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1, 10</a>).<p>&#8226; Manasseh was only twelve (<a href="/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>), meaning part of his upbringing overlapped the fifteen bonus years of Hezekiah&#8217;s life. Yet he quickly reversed his father&#8217;s reforms, practicing idolatry &#8220;more evil than the nations&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/21-2.htm">2 Kings 21:2-9</a>).<p>&#8226; His reign&#8212;longest in Judah at fifty-five years&#8212;illustrates how quickly a godly heritage can be squandered when a new generation rejects the LORD (<a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, God&#8217;s grace breaks through: when disciplined, Manasseh &#8220;humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers&#8221; and was restored (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-10.htm">2 Chronicles 33:10-13</a>). His late repentance shows that no sinner is beyond reach while life remains (<a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6-7</a>; <a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17-24</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast between father and son warns believers that personal faith cannot be inherited; each heart must choose obedience (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>; <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/20-21.htm">2 Kings 20:21</a> records a quiet transition packed with meaning. Hezekiah&#8217;s death is a peaceful home-going after a life of trust, assuring us that God keeps His servants in life and in death. Manasseh&#8217;s succession, though initially tragic, proves both the sturdiness of God&#8217;s covenant and the ongoing need for every generation to embrace that covenant personally. Together the verse reminds us that God&#8217;s plan moves forward through life, death, and even failure, steadily advancing toward the ultimate King who will reign forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah slept with his fathers.</span> The writer of Chronicles adds, "And they buried him in the chiefest," or rather, in the topmost, "of the sepulchers of the sons of David" (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-33.htm">2 Chronicles 32:33</a>).
