After the death of Ahaziah, his mother Athaliah sought to destroy all the royal heirs to secure her power. Joash's survival was crucial for the Davidic line, which was prophesied to bring forth the Messiah (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). His nurse played a vital role in his protection, highlighting the importance of faithful caregivers in God's plan. This act of hiding Joash parallels the preservation of Moses in <a href="/exodus/2-2.htm">Exodus 2:2-3</a>, where God protects His chosen leaders in times of peril.<p><b>in the house of the LORD</b><br>The house of the LORD refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a sacred place where God's presence dwelt among His people. The temple served as a sanctuary for Joash, symbolizing God's protection and provision. This setting underscores the theme of divine refuge found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>, where God is described as a shelter in times of trouble. The temple's role as a place of safety for Joash also foreshadows the ultimate sanctuary found in Christ, who is our refuge and strength (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18-20</a>).<p><b>for six years</b><br>The six-year period signifies a time of waiting and preparation. Biblically, the number six often represents incompleteness or human effort, as seen in the six days of creation before God's rest on the seventh day. During these years, Joash was being prepared for his future role as king, much like how David was prepared in the wilderness before ascending to the throne. This period of concealment and growth is reminiscent of Jesus' hidden years before His public ministry, emphasizing the importance of God's timing in fulfilling His purposes.<p><b>while Athaliah ruled the land</b><br>Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, was a usurper who ruled Judah with idolatry and tyranny. Her reign represents a period of spiritual darkness and apostasy, similar to the reign of Ahab in Israel. Athaliah's rule is a reminder of the constant battle between the forces of evil and God's sovereign plan. Despite her attempts to eradicate the Davidic line, God's covenant promises remained unbroken, as seen in the eventual rise of Joash to the throne. This narrative echoes the assurance found in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, that God works all things for the good of those who love Him, even amidst apparent chaos and evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>The young heir to the throne of Judah, hidden to protect him from Athaliah's murderous intent.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehosheba.htm">Jehosheba</a></b><br>The daughter of King Jehoram and sister of King Ahaziah, who saved Joash from being killed by Athaliah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/athaliah.htm">Athaliah</a></b><br>The mother of Ahaziah, who usurped the throne of Judah and sought to destroy the royal family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada.htm">Jehoiada</a></b><br>The high priest who played a crucial role in protecting Joash and later orchestrated his ascension to the throne.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD (Temple)</a></b><br>The place where Joash was hidden for six years, symbolizing God's protection and presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>God's hand is evident in preserving His chosen leaders, even in dire circumstances.

This echoes Mephibosheth&#8217;s nurse, who risked safety for her charge (<a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>). The role highlights God&#8217;s concern for vulnerable lives (<a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>) and shows how ordinary people participate in His redemptive plan (<a href="/2_kings/11-2.htm">2 Kings 11:2</a>). It reminds believers that faithfulness in small, unseen tasks can have kingdom-wide implications (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The hiding place was &#8220;the house of the LORD,&#8221; the temple complex Jehosheba and Jehoiada oversaw (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1-7</a>).

The passage also foreshadows the temple&#8217;s role in restoring true worship when Joash is revealed (<a href="/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for six years</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;For six years&#8221; points to a defined season of waiting.

Those years allowed Joash to grow physically and spiritually under priestly guidance, illustrating <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>: &#8220;Let us not grow weary in well-doing, for in due season we will reap.&#8221; Believers learn the value of patient preparation, trusting God&#8217;s timing (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>while Athaliah ruled the land</b><p>&#8226; The backdrop is Athaliah&#8217;s usurpation (<a href="/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1</a>), a reign marked by idolatry and violence (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>). Yet her apparent dominance is temporary; <a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12-13</a> assures that the wicked plot in vain because &#8220;the Lord laughs at him, for He sees his day is coming.&#8221; God&#8217;s covenant promise to David (<a href="/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11-12</a>) stands unbroken, even when evil seems entrenched.

The verse invites believers to trust God&#8217;s protective care, value faithfulness in obscurity, and rest in His timing, confident that no earthly power can overturn His promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And he was with her</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, with Jehosheba his aunt. The words "in the house of the Lord" should immediately follow. The Word "hid" is connected with "six years" in the Hebrew, and relates to the infant prince only. Joash was with his aunt "in the house of the Lord"--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, in one of the chambers allotted to the priests, perhaps even in the high priest's residence, which may have been within the sacred precincts. Thenius assumes that the statement of Chronicles, that Jehosheba was wife of the high priest, has no other ground than a "traditional interpretation" of these words; and asserts that Jehosheba was herself obliged to share the asylum of the infant prince in order to escape the vengeance of Athaliah. But it is certain that the chronicler had better authority than mere tradition for his important additions to the history of the kings. (See Note on <a href="/2_chronicles/22-11.htm" title="But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.">2Chronicles 22:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Did reign.</span>--<span class= "ital">Was reigning.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he was with her</span> - he, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Joash, was with her, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehosheba, his aunt - hid in the house of the Lord; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the temple. We learn from Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>) that Jehosheba was married to Jehoiada, the high priest, and would thus have ready access to the temple. We must suppose that, after a few days' concealment in the "chamber of mattresses," Jehosheba found an opportunity of transferring him, with his nurse, to a chamber in the temple, where he was thenceforward nourished and brought up. There were various chambers in the temple used for secular purposes, as we learn from <a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5-8</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/13-5.htm">Nehemiah 13:5-9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Six years</span> (comp. ver. 21 and <a href="/2_chronicles/24-1.htm">2 Chronicles 24:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Athaliah did reign over the land.</span> It is difficult to realize all that this implies. It cannot mean less than that for six years Baalism was triumphant in Judah - the temple was allowed to fall into decay (<a href="/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5</a>) - a temple to Baal was erected in Jerusalem itself, to supersede the temple of Jehovah (<a href="/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>), and a high priest appointed to be a rival to the successor of Aaron. Whether persecution was indulged in, as under Jehoram (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-11.htm">2 Chronicles 21:11</a>), is uncertain; but the servants of Jehovah were at any rate under a cloud, slighted, contemned, held as of small account. Perhaps we may conclude, from the position occupied by Jehoiada, and from the powers which he was able to exercise when he determined on revolt (ver. 4; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1, 2</a>), that Athaliah, during her six years' reign, was to some extent held in check by a Jehovistic party, which she knew to exist, and which she did not dare openly to defy. Thus she left Jehoiada (apparently) in possession of the temple, of its treasures and its armory (ver. 10); she allowed the temple service to continue (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4-7</a>); she permitted the priests and the Levites to serve in their regular "courses" (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-8.htm">2 Chronicles 23:8</a>); she let the fortress of the eastern city - for the temple was always a fortress - remain in her enemies' hands. Still, the time was evidently one "of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy" the oppressed worshippers of Jehovah were greatly discontented; and the nation generally was ripe for a counter-revolution, so soon as the signal was given by an authority whom they could trust. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/11-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And [Joash] remained</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
