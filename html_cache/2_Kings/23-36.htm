His ascension to the throne at the age of twenty-five marks a significant transition from the reforms of his father to a period of decline. This age suggests a level of maturity, yet his reign would be characterized by a departure from his father's godly ways. The age of twenty-five is notable in biblical terms, as it often signifies a time of readiness for leadership, as seen with other kings and priests.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years</b><br>Jehoiakim's reign lasted from approximately 609 to 598 BC. His rule was marked by political instability and spiritual decline. The eleven-year reign is significant as it was a time of increasing pressure from external powers, particularly Egypt and Babylon. Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, was the center of religious and political life, and Jehoiakim's reign there would see the city under threat from foreign domination, leading to eventual exile.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah</b><br>The mention of Zebidah, Jehoiakim's mother, highlights the importance of maternal lineage in the biblical narrative. Zebidah's name, meaning "gift" or "endowment," may reflect the hope or expectations placed upon her son. The inclusion of her father's name, Pedaiah, provides a genealogical link that was important for establishing legitimacy and heritage in the ancient Near Eastern context.<p><b>she was from Rumah</b><br>Rumah is believed to be a location in the region of Judah, though its exact identification remains uncertain. The mention of Zebidah's origin from Rumah may indicate a connection to a specific clan or family group, which could have political or social implications. This geographical detail provides insight into the familial and tribal affiliations that played a role in the political landscape of Judah during Jehoiakim's reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah who began his reign at the age of twenty-five and ruled for eleven years.

Second Kings and the parallel account in <a href="/2_chronicles/36-5.htm">2 Chronicles 36:5</a> agree on the number, underscoring reliability.<p>&#8226; Twenty-five means he was no novice, yet still young enough to be impressionable. That matters because he followed his godly father, Josiah (<a href="/bsb/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22&#8211;23</a>), but chose a different moral path (<a href="/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah began prophesying &#8220;in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/26-1.htm">Jeremiah 26:1</a>), so his age also situates many prophetic messages that warned Judah.<p>&#8226; Practically, the verse reminds us that every leader&#8212;no matter how old&#8212;must choose whether to honor the legacy of faithful parents or reject it (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years</b><p>&#8226; Eleven literal years (609-598 BC) were long enough for consistent patterns to emerge. <a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a> adds that after three of those years he rebelled against Babylon, triggering judgment.<p>&#8226; The location &#8220;in Jerusalem&#8221; ties his government to the covenant city. His sin therefore had temple-centered consequences (<a href="/jeremiah/7-30.htm">Jeremiah 7:30-34</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehoiakim&#8217;s reign shows how quickly a nation can spiral when leadership embraces injustice (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13-19</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s timeline is precise: the eleven years fulfill earlier warnings that unfaithfulness would shorten the dynasty (<a href="/1_kings/9-6.htm">1 Kings 9:6-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah</b><p>&#8226; The Bible often names a king&#8217;s mother (e.g., <a href="/2_kings/14-2.htm">2 Kings 14:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>) to verify lineage and highlight family influence.<p>&#8226; Zebidah&#8217;s mention testifies to historical detail; these are not anonymous myths.<p>&#8226; A mother can shape a king&#8217;s character (<a href="/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a>). While Scripture is silent on Zebidah&#8217;s faith, her son&#8217;s choices show that a righteous heritage is no guarantee of obedience (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she was from Rumah</b><p>&#8226; Rumah was a real town, likely in Galilee (suggested by its pairing with Daberath in <a href="/joshua/19-12.htm">Joshua 19:12</a>). Stating her hometown roots Jehoiakim in Israel&#8217;s broader geography.<p>&#8226; This detail guards against legendary embellishment and invites readers to see God&#8217;s dealings with actual places and people (<a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; It also hints at the diverse backgrounds represented in Judah&#8217;s royal court, reminding us that God weaves every region of His people into salvation history (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a> offers more than a dry statistic. It records the literal age, duration, family, and hometown behind Jehoiakim&#8217;s reign, affirming Scripture&#8217;s accuracy. Each phrase sets the stage for understanding how a 25-year-old king, ruling eleven years from Jerusalem, influenced by his mother Zebidah of Rumah, chose a path that led Judah toward exile.
