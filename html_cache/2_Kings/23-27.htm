It reflects the prophetic tradition where God's will is communicated through His prophets. This aligns with the biblical theme that God speaks through His chosen messengers, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>I will remove Judah from My sight</b><br>This statement is a declaration of impending judgment. Historically, it refers to the Babylonian exile, where the people of Judah were taken captive. Theologically, it signifies God's withdrawal of protection and favor due to persistent disobedience and idolatry, similar to the fate of the northern kingdom of Israel.<p><b>just as I removed Israel</b><br>This comparison to Israel's earlier exile by the Assyrians serves as a warning and a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God. It underscores the unity of God's standards for both kingdoms and the impartiality of His justice.<p><b>I will reject this city Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Judah, was chosen by God as the place for His temple. The rejection of Jerusalem signifies a profound shift, highlighting the seriousness of Judah's sins. This echoes the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah about the consequences of forsaking God's covenant.<p><b>which I chose</b><br>God's choice of Jerusalem as His dwelling place is rooted in His covenant with David, where He promised that David's lineage would have a lasting kingdom. This choice is significant in biblical history, as it establishes Jerusalem as a central location for worship and governance.<p><b>and the temple of which I said, &#8216;My Name shall be there.&#8217;</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the physical manifestation of God's presence among His people. The phrase "My Name shall be there" indicates God's dwelling and His covenant relationship with Israel. The rejection of the temple signifies a breach in this relationship due to the people's unfaithfulness. This foreshadows the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the true temple, where God's presence dwells among humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is speaking about His judgment on Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which is facing divine judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, previously judged and exiled by God due to their persistent idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, chosen by God as the place for His Name to dwell, now facing rejection due to the people's unfaithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The sacred place in Jerusalem where God's presence was to dwell, now being rejected as a consequence of the nation's sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>God's judgment on Judah highlights the seriousness with which He views sin and disobedience.

The same God who faithfully chose Jerusalem now faithfully enforces His covenant by removing Judah, just as He had removed Israel. Election is a privilege, never a license; when God&#8217;s people abandon Him, He may withdraw His presence, protection, and even the earthly symbols of His Name. Yet His justice underscores the reliability of every word He speaks, inviting us to love Him with undivided hearts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said</span> - God said in his secret counsels, came to the determination, and pronounced the sentence in his thoughts - <span class="cmt_word">I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel</span> (comp. <a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>, "Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel, and <span class="accented">removed them out of his sight"</span>).
