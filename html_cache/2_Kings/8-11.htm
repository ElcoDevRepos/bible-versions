His ability to discern the future and the hearts of men is evident here. The act of fixing his gaze suggests a moment of intense spiritual discernment. In biblical times, prophets often received revelations through visions or deep contemplation. This moment parallels other instances where prophets, like Daniel, received divine insight through focused attention (<a href="/daniel/10-7.htm">Daniel 10:7-9</a>).<p><b>until Hazael became uncomfortable</b><br>Hazael, a high-ranking official in the Aramean court, is the subject of Elisha's penetrating gaze. His discomfort indicates an awareness of the gravity of the moment. In the ancient Near East, the presence of a prophet was often associated with the revelation of God's will, which could be unsettling, especially if it involved judgment or significant change. Hazael's unease foreshadows his future actions and the role he will play in the fulfillment of God's plans, as he later becomes king and a tool of judgment against Israel (<a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12-15</a>).<p><b>Then the man of God began to weep</b><br>Elisha's weeping reveals his compassion and the burden of knowing the future suffering that Hazael will inflict upon Israel. The title "man of God" emphasizes Elisha's role as a divine messenger. His tears reflect the heart of God, who takes no pleasure in the suffering of His people (<a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>). This moment is reminiscent of Jesus weeping over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>), showing a parallel in the sorrow felt by God's messengers over the impending judgment and suffering due to the people's disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God in Israel, known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel.

God alone &#8220;sees not as man sees&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>), and His prophet mirrors that penetrating vision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Until Hazael became uncomfortable</b><p>&#8220;until Hazael felt ashamed&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/8-11.htm">2 Kings 8:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Hazael&#8217;s unease shows that the human conscience wilts under holy scrutiny&#8212;Adam hid in the garden (<a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>), and the woman at the well shifted the conversation when Jesus touched her secret (<a href="/john/4-17.htm">John 4:17&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; Elisha&#8217;s silent stare is enough to expose what lies ahead: Hazael will murder his king (v. 15) and later ravage Israel (v. 12).<p>&#8226; Like the accusers who slipped away when Jesus wrote on the ground (<a href="/john/8-9.htm">John 8:9</a>), Hazael senses judgment before a word is spoken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then the man of God began to weep</b><p>&#8220;Then the man of God began to weep&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/8-11.htm">2 Kings 8:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Elisha has just glimpsed horrors: &#8220;You will set fire to their fortresses, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little ones, and rip open their pregnant women&#8221; (v. 12).<p>&#8226; Tears reveal God&#8217;s heart. Jeremiah wept over Jerusalem&#8217;s sins (<a href="/jeremiah/9-1.htm">Jeremiah 9:1</a>), and Jesus later did the same (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>). Divine judgment is never cold or detached (<a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s sorrow balances the certainty of God&#8217;s plan with compassion for the people who will suffer. Paul carried &#8220;great sorrow and unceasing anguish&#8221; for Israel even while affirming God&#8217;s sovereignty (<a href="/romans/9-2.htm">Romans 9:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Elisha&#8217;s tears teach us to hold truth and tenderness together: we do not soften God&#8217;s warnings, yet we grieve over coming destruction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elisha&#8217;s fixed gaze, Hazael&#8217;s discomfort, and the prophet&#8217;s tears together unveil a solemn truth: God foresees sin and its consequences, exposes the sinner&#8217;s heart, and still grieves over the pain wickedness will cause. The verse reminds believers to see with spiritual clarity, confront evil honestly, and let compassion flow&#8212;even when judgment is certain&#8212;just as our God does.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And he settled his countenance stedfastly.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and he</span> (Elisha) <span class= "ital">made his face stand, and set</span> (it upon Hazael).<p><span class= "bld">Until he was ashamed.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">unto being ashamed</span>.
