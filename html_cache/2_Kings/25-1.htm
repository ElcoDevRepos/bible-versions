His reign was marked by political instability and rebellion against Babylonian rule. The ninth year of his reign corresponds to 588 BC. This period was a time of great turmoil for Judah, as they were under the threat of Babylonian domination. Zedekiah was placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar after the exile of Jehoiachin, and his reign was characterized by a lack of true allegiance to God, leading to the eventual downfall of Jerusalem.<p><b>on the tenth day of the tenth month</b><br>This specific date is significant in the Jewish calendar, corresponding to Tevet 10. It marks the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem, a pivotal event in Jewish history. The precision of the date underscores the importance of the event and is commemorated in Jewish tradition as a fast day, known as the Tenth of Tevet, remembering the calamities that befell Jerusalem.<p><b>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar II was one of the most powerful monarchs of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, reigning from 605 to 562 BC. He is known for his military conquests and the expansion of the Babylonian Empire. His campaigns against Judah were part of his broader strategy to control the region and secure his empire's borders. Nebuchadnezzar is also noted for his role in the destruction of Jerusalem and the subsequent Babylonian Exile, a significant event in biblical history.<p><b>marched against Jerusalem with his entire army</b><br>The march against Jerusalem was a decisive military action aimed at quelling rebellion and asserting Babylonian dominance. The phrase "entire army" indicates the seriousness of the campaign and the resources Nebuchadnezzar was willing to commit. This military action was a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah, who had foretold the consequences of Judah's disobedience and reliance on foreign alliances instead of trusting in God.<p><b>They encamped outside the city</b><br>The Babylonian army set up camp around Jerusalem, initiating a siege that would last for approximately 18 months. This encampment was a strategic move to cut off supplies and weaken the city's defenses. The siege was a common military tactic in ancient warfare, designed to force a city into submission through starvation and psychological pressure. The encampment also fulfilled prophecies of judgment against Jerusalem for its unfaithfulness.<p><b>and built a siege wall all around it</b><br>The construction of a siege wall, or rampart, was intended to isolate Jerusalem completely, preventing any escape or entry. This tactic was used to ensure that the city could not receive reinforcements or supplies, leading to eventual surrender. The siege wall symbolizes the inescapable judgment that had been prophesied by Jeremiah and other prophets. It also serves as a type of the spiritual siege that sin places on humanity, from which only divine intervention can deliver.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, appointed by Nebuchadnezzar, who reigned from 597 to 586 BC.

In the whole range of the history contained in the two Books of the Kings, there is no instance of the year, month, and day being all given excepting in the present chapter, where we find this extreme exactness three times (vers. 1, 4, and 8). The date in ver. 1 is confirmed by <a href="/jeremiah/52-10.htm">Jeremiah 52:10</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/24-1.htm">Ezekiel 24:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem</span>. 'According to the description of the eye-witness, Jeremiah, the army was one of unusual magnitude.

The march of the army was not direct upon Jerusalem; it at first spread itself over Judea, wasting the country and capturing the smaller fortified towns (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:7. &sect;3) - among them Lachish, so famous in the war against Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14, 17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-8.htm">2 Kings 19:8</a>), and Azekah (<a href="/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>). The capture of these two places was important as intercepting Zedekiah's line of communication with Egypt. Having made himself master of them, Nebuchadnezzar proceeded to invest the capital. <span class="cmt_word">And pitched against it</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, encamped, and commenced a regular siege - <span class="cmt_word">and they built forts against it round about.</span> It has been argued that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span> does not mean a "fort" or "tower," but a "line of circumvallation" (Michaelis, Hitzig, Thenius, Bahr).

The towers used in sieges by the Assyrians and Babylonians were movable ones, made of planks, which were pushed up to the walls, so that the assailants might attack their adversaries, on a level, with greater advantage. Sometimes they contained battering rams (see Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' first series, pl. 19; and setup. <a href="/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/26-8.htm">Ezekiel 26:8</a>; Josephus, 'Ant.
