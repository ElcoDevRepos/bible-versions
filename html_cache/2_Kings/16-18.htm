The Assyrians were a dominant power in the region, and Ahaz sought their favor and protection against threats from neighboring kingdoms. This reliance on Assyria reflects a lack of trust in God&#8217;s protection and a departure from the covenantal faithfulness expected of the kings of Judah.<p><b>he removed the Sabbath canopy they had built in the temple</b><br>The Sabbath canopy likely refers to a structure or covering associated with the observance of the Sabbath, possibly used for ceremonial purposes. Its removal signifies a disregard for the sanctity of the Sabbath and the temple, which were central to Israelite worship and identity. This action demonstrates Ahaz's willingness to compromise religious practices to appease foreign powers, contrasting with the reforms of later kings like Hezekiah and Josiah who sought to restore proper worship.<p><b>and closed the royal entryway outside the house of the LORD</b><br>Closing the royal entryway suggests a significant alteration to the temple complex, possibly to prevent access or to repurpose the area for Assyrian interests. This act symbolizes the encroachment of foreign influence into the sacred spaces of Judah, highlighting the spiritual decline under Ahaz&#8217;s leadership.

Earlier in the chapter he &#8220;sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, &#8216;I am your servant and your son&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>), choosing political deliverance over trusting the LORD (cf. <a href="/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; His deference to Assyria now shapes his worship decisions. Like the northern king Menahem who paid tribute (<a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19-20</a>), Ahaz treats human power as ultimate, in direct contrast to <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>, where Israel&#8217;s king is to submit to God&#8217;s law alone.<p>&#8226; Cross references: <a href="/2_chronicles/28-16.htm">2 Chronicles 28:16-21</a> describes the same appeasement; <a href="/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a> shows Judah &#8220;going to Assyria&#8221; as spiritual infidelity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he removed the Sabbath canopy they had built in the temple</b><p>&#8226; The canopy (sometimes called a &#8220;covered walkway&#8221; or &#8220;pavilion&#8221;) marked out sacred space for Sabbath worship, likely shielding priests and worshipers as they assembled (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/46-4.htm">Ezekiel 46:4-8</a> where special structures accommodate Sabbath offerings).<p>&#8226; By dismantling it, Ahaz downgrades the Sabbath, disregarding <a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13-17</a>, where the day is a perpetual covenant sign.<p>&#8226; His action signals that Assyrian favor outweighs covenant faithfulness. Like Jeroboam&#8217;s golden calves (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>), structural changes reflect doctrinal compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and closed the royal entryway outside the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; This passageway probably linked the palace to the temple court, reserved for the king&#8217;s ceremonial approach (see <a href="/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-13.htm">2 Chronicles 23:13-15</a>). By sealing it, Ahaz cuts the monarchy off from direct worship, distancing himself from the God who established the throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; It demonstrates how sin isolates leaders from divine presence. Later, righteous Hezekiah reopens and repairs temple access (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3</a>), reversing Ahaz&#8217;s closure, echoing <a href="/psalms/24-9.htm">Psalm 24:9</a>, &#8220;Lift up your heads, O gates &#8230; that the King of Glory may come in.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Ahaz, fearing Assyria, dismantles sanctuary structures and seals the royal gateway, shrinking God&#8217;s space to please a pagan empire. Each alteration&#8212;motivated by misplaced trust&#8212;erodes Sabbath honor, priestly ministry, and royal accountability to God. The verse warns that yielding worship practices to worldly pressures fractures covenant life, but also sets the stage for Hezekiah&#8217;s reform, proving that faithfulness can restore what fear removes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">The covert for the sabbath.</span>--A very obscure expression.
