It served as a base for their initial conquest of Canaan. Elisha's return to Gilgal signifies a return to a place of spiritual heritage and renewal. This location is also associated with prophetic activity, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/2.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a>, where Elijah and Elisha traveled from Gilgal before Elijah's ascension.<p><b>there was a famine in the land</b><br>Famines were not uncommon in the ancient Near East and often served as a divine instrument for judgment or testing. In the context of Israel, famines were sometimes a result of the nation's disobedience to God, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23-24</a>. This particular famine sets the stage for a demonstration of God's provision through Elisha, reminiscent of the miracles performed by Elijah during a previous famine (1 Kings 17).<p><b>As the sons of the prophets were sitting at his feet</b><br>The "sons of the prophets" refers to a group of prophetic disciples or a school of prophets. These groups were communities dedicated to learning and practicing the prophetic ministry. Sitting at Elisha's feet indicates a position of learning and submission, similar to the relationship between a rabbi and his disciples, as seen in <a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a> with Mary sitting at Jesus' feet.<p><b>he said to his attendant</b><br>Elisha's attendant, likely Gehazi, played a significant role in assisting the prophet, similar to the role of Joshua to Moses. This relationship highlights the importance of mentorship and service in the prophetic ministry. Gehazi's later actions in <a href="/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20-27</a> serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of greed and disobedience.<p><b>Put on the large pot and boil some stew</b><br>The large pot signifies a communal meal, reflecting the communal nature of the prophetic community. The act of boiling stew is a practical response to the famine, demonstrating Elisha's role not only as a spiritual leader but also as a provider for the physical needs of his followers. This mirrors the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16) and foreshadows Jesus' feeding of the multitudes (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>).<p><b>for the sons of the prophets</b><br>This phrase underscores the communal and supportive environment within the prophetic community. The provision of food during a famine is a testament to God's care for His people and His ability to provide in times of need. It also highlights the role of the prophetic community in sustaining spiritual and physical life, akin to the early Christian community in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-47</a>, where believers shared everything in common.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet and successor of Elijah, known for performing miracles and guiding the people of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilgal.htm">Gilgal</a></b><br>A location in Israel, significant in biblical history as a place of worship and prophetic activity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>A severe shortage of food affecting the land, often seen as a time of testing and reliance on God's provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_the_prophets.htm">Sons of the Prophets</a></b><br>A group of prophetic disciples or followers who were under the mentorship of prophets like Elisha.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha's_servant.htm">Elisha's Servant</a></b><br>An unnamed assistant to Elisha, tasked with preparing food for the group.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_in_times_of_need.htm">God's Provision in Times of Need</a></b><br>Just as God provided for the sons of the prophets during the famine, He is faithful to provide for us in our times of need. We are called to trust in His provision and care.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_faithful_servants.htm">The Role of Faithful Servants</a></b><br>Elisha's servant played a crucial role in preparing the meal. This reminds us that God often uses ordinary people to accomplish His purposes. We should be willing to serve in whatever capacity God calls us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_fellowship.htm">Community and Fellowship</a></b><br>The sons of the prophets gathered together during a time of crisis, emphasizing the importance of community and fellowship among believers. In difficult times, we should seek support and encouragement from our faith community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>Elisha's directive to prepare the stew was followed without question. This teaches us the importance of obedience to God's instructions, even when the outcome is uncertain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_nourishment.htm">Spiritual Nourishment</a></b><br>Just as physical food was necessary for the sons of the prophets, spiritual nourishment through God's Word is essential for our spiritual well-being.

Famine is a covenant warning (<a href="/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19-20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23-24</a>), reminding the reader that Israel&#8217;s physical hardships often flow from spiritual waywardness.<p>&#8226; Yet God raises up prophets during such seasons to provide both Word and sustenance (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1-7</a> with Elijah; <a href="/2_kings/3-17.htm">2 Kings 3:17-18</a> for water).<p>&#8226; The detail prepares us to see the miraculous provision about to unfold, affirming that human need is the arena for divine supply (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The sons of the prophets were sitting at his feet</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;As the sons of the prophets were sitting at his feet&#8221; (4:38c). This image shows committed discipleship: to sit at a teacher&#8217;s feet is to receive authoritative instruction (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a>; <a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>).<p>&#8226; These guild members formed schools of ministry, preserving faithfulness amid national apostasy (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3, 5, 7</a>).<p>&#8226; Their posture highlights two hungers&#8212;physical and spiritual. While famine grips the land, they seek the Word first (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He said to his attendant, &#8220;Put on the large pot and boil some stew&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Elisha orders, &#8220;Put on the large pot and boil some stew&#8221; (4:38d). The directive is practical but anticipates supernatural intervention, as resources are scarce.<p>&#8226; God often works through ordinary means&#8212;pots, meal, oil&#8212;to demonstrate that the power lies not in the vessel but in Him (2 <a href="/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/17-12.htm">1 Kings 17:12-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;large pot&#8221; signals generosity; even in famine, God&#8217;s servant expects abundance (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>). This mirrors Christ&#8217;s instruction to seat the multitude before multiplying loaves (<a href="/john/6-10.htm">John 6:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the sons of the prophets</b><p>&#8226; The stew is &#8220;for the sons of the prophets&#8221; (4:38e). Ministry leaders are not exempt from physical need, and God cares for those who serve Him (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-14.htm">1 Corinthians 9:14</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Elisha&#8217;s concern models shepherd-like leadership, foreshadowing the Good Shepherd who prepares a table for His sheep (<a href="/john/21-9.htm">John 21:9-13</a>).<p>&#8226; In providing for His prophets, the LORD preserves the channels of His Word, ensuring Israel continues to hear truth despite national crisis (<a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a> sets the stage for a miracle by painting a realistic picture: a faithful prophet returns to a historically significant place, a literal famine ravages the land, and hungry disciples gather for instruction. Elisha&#8217;s command to prepare a large pot of stew reveals confident expectation that God will supply in extraordinary fashion. The verse underscores God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness, His care for those devoted to His Word, and the principle that physical provision often flows through obedient, faith-filled acts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38-44) Elisha among the sons of the prophets at Gilgal during the famine.<p>(38) <span class= "bld">And Elisha came again</span>.--<span class= "ital">Now Elisha had returned</span>, commencing a new narrative.
