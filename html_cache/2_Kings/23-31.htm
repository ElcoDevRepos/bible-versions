At twenty-three, Jehoahaz was relatively young to ascend the throne, especially following a king like Josiah who had initiated significant religious reforms. His age suggests a lack of experience, which may have contributed to his short reign. The choice of Jehoahaz over his older brother Eliakim (later Jehoiakim) might indicate a preference by the people or a political maneuver, as Jehoahaz was chosen by the people of the land (<a href="/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>).<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem three months</b><br>Jehoahaz's reign was notably brief, lasting only three months. This short duration highlights the political instability in Judah at the time, as the kingdom was caught between the powerful empires of Egypt and Babylon. His reign ended when Pharaoh Necho II of Egypt deposed him, taking him captive to Egypt (<a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33-34</a>). This event underscores the geopolitical pressures on Judah, as Egypt sought to exert control over the region following the death of Josiah at Megiddo.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah</b><br>Hamutal, Jehoahaz's mother, was the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, not to be confused with the prophet Jeremiah. Her mention indicates the importance of maternal lineage in the royal records, which could influence a king's legitimacy and political alliances. The inclusion of her name suggests her possible influence in the royal court or her family's significance in Judah.<p><b>she was from Libnah</b><br>Libnah was a town in the Shephelah region of Judah, known for its historical significance and involvement in various biblical events. It was one of the Levitical cities (<a href="/joshua/21-13.htm">Joshua 21:13</a>) and had previously revolted against King Jehoram of Judah (<a href="/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>).

Pharaoh-Nechoh, having defeated Josiah, left Jerusalem and Judaea behind him, while he pressed forward on his original enterprise (see ver. 29) into Northern Syria and the district about Carehemish, or the tract north-east of Aleppo. It was three months before he had completed his conquests in these quarters, and, having arranged matters to his satisfaction, set out on his return to Egypt. During these three months Jehoahaz bore rule at Jerusalem (ver. 31), and "did evil in the sight of the Lord" (ver. 32). Ezekiel compares him to "a young lion," which "learned to catch the prey, and devoured men" (Ezekiel 19:3). It may be suspected that he re-established the idolatries which Josiah had put down; but this is uncertain. Pharaoh-Nechoh, on his return from Carehemish, learning what the Jews had done, sent envoys to Jerusalem, and summoned Jehoahaz to his presence at Riblah, in the territory of Hamath (ver. 33; comp. Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:5. &sect; 2). Je-hoahaz obeyed the summons; and Nechoh, having obtained possession of his person, "put him in bands," and carried him off to Egypt, where he died (ver. 34; comp. <a href="/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10-12</a>; Josephus, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign.</span> He was, therefore, younger than his brother Eliakim, who, three months later, was "twenty-five years old" (ver. 36).
