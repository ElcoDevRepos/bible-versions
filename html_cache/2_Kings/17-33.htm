Despite acknowledging the LORD, their worship was not exclusive or pure. This reflects the broader context of Israel's history, where the worship of Yahweh was often mixed with pagan practices, contrary to the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The divided heart of the Israelites is a recurring theme, as seen in Elijah's challenge on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>).<p><b>but they also served their own gods</b><br>The Israelites' service to other gods indicates a failure to fully commit to the covenant with Yahweh. This practice was influenced by the surrounding nations and was a direct violation of the covenantal laws given in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-14.htm">Deuteronomy 6:14-15</a>. The worship of other gods often included idolatry and practices detestable to the LORD, leading to spiritual and moral decline.<p><b>according to the customs of the nations</b><br>The adoption of foreign customs was a significant issue for Israel, as it led them away from the distinct identity and practices commanded by God. This phrase underscores the influence of Canaanite and other pagan cultures on Israel, which often included rituals and sacrifices that were abominable to the LORD (<a href="/leviticus/18-3.htm">Leviticus 18:3</a>). The Israelites' failure to remain separate from these customs was a recurring problem throughout their history.<p><b>from which they had been carried away</b><br>This refers to the Assyrian exile, where the Northern Kingdom of Israel was conquered and its people were deported. The Assyrians had a policy of relocating conquered peoples to prevent rebellion, which led to the mixing of populations and religious practices. This historical context explains the syncretism observed in the verse, as the Israelites were influenced by the religious practices of the regions to which they were exiled. The exile was a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Hosea and Amos, who called Israel to repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom of Israel, which had been taken into exile by the Assyrians due to their disobedience to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assyrians.htm">The Assyrians</a></b><br>The empire that conquered the Northern Kingdom and resettled people from various nations into the land of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Various peoples brought by the Assyrians to inhabit the land of Israel, each with their own gods and customs.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God whom the Israelites were commanded to worship exclusively.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exile.htm">The Exile</a></b><br>The event where the Israelites were taken from their land due to their persistent idolatry and disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/exclusive_worship_of_god.htm">Exclusive Worship of God</a></b><br>God demands exclusive worship.

Their fear prompted outward acts of homage&#8212;building altars, offering sacrifices, even bringing in an Israelite priest to teach them &#8220;how they should worship the LORD&#8221; (v. 27).<p>&#8226; This shows that mere recognition of the true God is not enough; He calls for heartfelt obedience (De 6:5; <a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently reveals that God receives worship only when it is given on His terms (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but they also served their own gods</b><p>&#8226; Side-by-side devotion to Yahweh and idols is spiritual adultery.
