Both were descendants of the house of Ahab, as Ahaziah's mother, Athaliah, was Ahab's daughter. This alliance between Ahaziah and Joram reflects the political and familial ties between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah during this period. The alliance is significant as it shows the influence of Ahab's house extending into Judah, which had implications for the spiritual state of the nation, as Ahab's reign was marked by idolatry and apostasy.<p><b>to fight against Hazael king of Aram</b><br>Hazael was a powerful king of Aram (Syria) who had been anointed by the prophet Elisha to become king (<a href="/2_kings/8-13.htm">2 Kings 8:13</a>). His reign marked a period of conflict with Israel. The Arameans were a constant threat to Israel, and Hazael's military campaigns were part of the fulfillment of God's judgment against Israel for their idolatry and disobedience. This battle is part of the larger narrative of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Aram, which is a recurring theme in the books of Kings.<p><b>at Ramoth-gilead</b><br>Ramoth-gilead was a strategically important city located east of the Jordan River in the territory of Gilead. It was a site of frequent conflict between Israel and Aram due to its strategic and economic significance. The city had previously been a Levitical city of refuge (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-43.htm">Deuteronomy 4:43</a>), highlighting its importance in Israel's history. The battle at Ramoth-gilead is reminiscent of the earlier battle where Ahab, Joram's father, was killed (1 Kings 22), indicating a continuation of hostilities in this region.<p><b>and the Arameans wounded Joram</b><br>Joram's wounding in battle is a pivotal moment that sets the stage for subsequent events, including his eventual assassination by Jehu (<a href="/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24</a>). This incident underscores the vulnerability of Israel's leadership and the consequences of their alliances and military campaigns. The wounding of Joram can be seen as part of God's judgment on the house of Ahab, as prophesied by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>). It also foreshadows the downfall of Joram and the end of Ahab's dynasty, which is a significant turning point in the history of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaziah.htm">Ahaziah</a></b><br>King of Judah, son of Jehoram and Athaliah, and grandson of Ahab and Jezebel.

It is best, therefore, to follow our translators, who are in accord both with the Septuagint and with the Vulgate.

Joram went to the relief of the town with a large force, and, being received within the walls, maintained a gallant defense (<a href="/2_kings/9-14.htm">2 Kings 9:14</a>), in the course of which he was wounded severely, though not fatally. Thereupon he and his brother king quitted the town and returned to their respective capitals, leaving a strong garrison in Ramoth-Gilead under Jehu and some other captains.
