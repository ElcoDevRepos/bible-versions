Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, is significant as the political and religious center that Jehu aims to purify. This journey symbolizes a transition from the old regime to a new order, reflecting God's judgment and fulfillment of prophecy (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16-17</a>).

This setting may symbolize the gathering of people for judgment, as Jehu's mission involves executing justice on the house of Ahab. The mention of shepherds can evoke imagery of leadership and guidance, contrasting the corrupt leadership of Ahab's lineage with the righteous leadership God desires.

His zeal contrasts sharply with Saul&#8217;s half-hearted obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-18.htm">1 Samuel 15:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture presents Jehu as an instrument of divine justice, even while later critiquing his own heart (<a href="/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>toward Samaria</b><p>Samaria is the political and religious center of the northern kingdom.<p>&#8226;

Moving from Jezreel to Samaria signals that judgment will reach every stronghold of Ahab&#8217;s dynasty (<a href="/2_kings/10-17.htm">2 Kings 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The direction is geographic, yet it also shows the breadth of God&#8217;s concern&#8212;no corner of Israel is exempt from accountability (<a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At Beth-eked of the Shepherds</b><p>&#8220;Beth-eked&#8221;

Jehu&#8217;s swift response ensures that alliances with the doomed house of Ahab cannot continue (<a href="/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The location reminds us that God&#8217;s purposes reach even into the &#8220;ordinary&#8221;

The adverb &#8220;then&#8221; keeps the narrative rushing forward; Jehu&#8217;s setting out showcases prompt obedience; the march toward Samaria targets the epicenter of idolatry; and the stop at Beth-eked of the Shepherds shows judgment overtaking the unsuspecting. The verse assures us that when God speaks, His word is fulfilled down to the last detail, whether in palaces or pasturelands, and calls us to the same wholehearted, timely obedience Jehu displays on this part of the journey.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">And he arose . . . and came.</span>--So the Syriac, rightly.
