The Jordan River often represents a boundary or transition point, as seen when the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land (Joshua 3). This crossing signifies a moment of transition and preparation for Elisha's upcoming role as a prophet.<p><b>Elijah said to Elisha</b><br>Elijah, a major prophet in Israel, is speaking to Elisha, his chosen successor. This moment highlights the mentor-mentee relationship between the two prophets. Elijah's role as a prophet was marked by miraculous acts and a strong call to return Israel to the worship of Yahweh. Elisha, who had been following and learning from Elijah, is about to take on this mantle of leadership.<p><b>&#8220;Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken away from you?&#8221;</b><br>Elijah's question indicates his awareness of his impending departure, which is a divine appointment. The phrase "taken away" foreshadows Elijah's unique departure from earth, as he would be taken up to heaven in a whirlwind (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>). This question also reflects the tradition of a departing leader bestowing a blessing or inheritance upon a successor, similar to the patriarchal blessings seen in Genesis.<p><b>&#8220;Please, let me inherit a double portion of your spirit,&#8221; Elisha replied.</b><br>Elisha's request for a "double portion" is rooted in the cultural context of inheritance laws, where the firstborn son received a double portion of the father's estate (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>). Elisha is not asking for twice the power of Elijah but rather to be recognized as his rightful spiritual heir. The "spirit" refers to the prophetic spirit and power that characterized Elijah's ministry. This request underscores Elisha's desire for the necessary empowerment to fulfill his prophetic calling. The concept of a "double portion" can also be seen as a type of Christ, who imparts the Holy Spirit to His followers, enabling them to continue His work on earth (<a href="/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A major prophet in Israel, known for his powerful miracles and his role in turning the hearts of the Israelites back to God.

Elijah&#8217;s earthly ministry is ending; Elisha&#8217;s is about to begin (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2-3</a> for leadership transition across water).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Elijah said to Elisha</b><p>&#8226; The veteran prophet turns to his prot&#233;g&#233; in a moment that feels both tender and weighty, much like Moses addressing Joshua (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Elijah had cast his mantle on Elisha years earlier (<a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>), and Elisha faithfully followed.

Elisha is asking to be Elijah&#8217;s rightful prophetic heir.<p>&#8226; He seeks &#8220;your spirit,&#8221; not material goods&#8212;yearning for the same prophetic power multiplied for greater service (cf. <a href="/numbers/11-17.htm">Numbers 11:17</a> where God distributed Moses&#8217; spirit to the elders; <a href="/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12</a> where Jesus promises greater works).<p>&#8226; Scripture records twice as many miracles through Elisha as through Elijah, affirming that God honored the request (<a href="/bsb/2_kings/4.htm">2 Kings 4-6</a>; 13:21).<p>&#8226; The bold plea models faith that God&#8217;s resources are unlimited (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>) and teaches believers to seek spiritual empowerment for God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/2-9.htm">2 Kings 2:9</a> captures the pivotal handoff between Elijah and Elisha. After miraculously crossing the Jordan, Elijah offers a parting gift; Elisha, recognizing his prophetic &#8220;firstborn&#8221; status, asks for a double share of Elijah&#8217;s spirit so he can serve with even greater effectiveness. The verse highlights God&#8217;s faithful continuity across generations, the legitimacy of asking for spiritual enablement, and the truth that divine power is available in abundance to those who earnestly seek it for His purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">I pray thee, let . . .</span>--Literally, And (i.e., well, then) <span class= "ital">let there fall, I pray thee, a portion of two in thy spirit, unto me.</span><p><span class= "bld">A double portion.</span>--The expression used in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-7.htm" title="And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.">Deuteronomy 21:7</a> of the share of the firstborn son, who by the Mosaic law inherited two parts of his father's property.<p>Elisha asks to be treated as the firstborn among "the sons of the prophets," and so to receive twice as great a share of "the spirit and power" of his master as any of the rest. "Let me be the firstborn among thy spiritual sons;" "Make me thy true spiritual heir;" not "Give me twice as great a share of the spirit of prophecy as thou possessest thyself," as many have wrongly interpreted. The phrase, "a mouth of two," seems to be a metaphor derived from the custom of serving honoured guests with double, and even greater, messes (<a href="/genesis/43-34.htm" title="And he took and sent messes to them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs.

He will soon have left the earth. A yearning comes over him, before he goes, to leave his faithful follower, his trusty, persevering adherent, some parting gift, some token of his appreciation, some sign of his love. What does his "minister" desire? Let him ask what he will, and his master will, if it be possible, grant it. <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</span> Elisha's request has been variously explained. The older commentators regarded him as having asked for twice as much spiritual and prophetical power as Elijah had possessed; and this interpretation is certainly favored by the reply of Elijah, as recorded in the next verse. But it is objected <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Elisha's modesty would prevent him from asking so much; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that double the spirit and power of Elijah certainly did not rest upon him. <p>This latter fact is quite undeniable. As Keil says, "It is only a quite external and superficial view of the career of Elisha that can see in it a proof that double the spirit of Elijah rested upon him" ('Commentary on Kings,' <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). To one who looks beneath the surface, and regards something besides length of life and number of miracles, Elisha is a very faint and feeble replica of Elijah. Ewald's judgment is here correct: "Elisha is great only so far as he continues and carries out with more force than any other man of his time the work which Elijah had begun with new and wonderful power... he did not possess any such intensity of inward power as his master" ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 82, Eng. trans.). Accordingly, Ewald, rejecting the old explanation, suggests one of his own - that Elisha asked for "two thirds of Elijah's spirit" (ibid., p. 81); but this would be a very strange and unusual request, even if the Hebrew could be made to mean it. Who ever asks for two-thirds of a thing? The third explanation, to which most modern commentators incline (Keil, Thenius, Patrick, Clarke, Pool, Bottcher), is that Elisha merely requested that he might receive twice as much of Elijah's spirit as should be received by any other of the "sons of the prophets." He made a reference to <a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>, and asked for the "double portion" (literally, "double mouthful") which was the right of an eldest son. The only objection to this view is Elijah's answer (see the next verse). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/2-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
