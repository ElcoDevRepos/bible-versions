The morning often symbolizes new beginnings or revelations in biblical narratives. In this context, it marks a pivotal moment in Jehu's consolidation of power.<p><b>Jehu went out and stood before all the people</b><br>Jehu's public appearance signifies his role as a leader and judge. Standing before the people suggests transparency and accountability, crucial for gaining public support. This act is reminiscent of other leaders in Israel who addressed the people to assert authority or deliver important messages, such as Moses and Joshua.<p><b>and said, &#8220;You are innocent.</b><br>Jehu's declaration of innocence to the people serves to absolve them of any guilt associated with the recent killings. This statement is strategic, as it distances the populace from the bloodshed and aligns them with Jehu's cause. It reflects a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures where leaders would publicly exonerate their subjects to maintain order and loyalty.<p><b>It was I who conspired against my master and killed him.</b><br>Jehu openly admits to conspiring against and killing King Joram, Ahab's son. This confession is significant as it highlights Jehu's role as an instrument of divine judgment against the house of Ahab, fulfilling the prophecy given to Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>). Jehu's actions are portrayed as divinely sanctioned, aligning with the biblical theme of God using individuals to execute His judgment.<p><b>But who killed all these?</b><br>Jehu's rhetorical question shifts the focus from his actions to the broader context of the massacre of Ahab's descendants. This question implies that the deaths were part of a larger divine plan, not solely his doing. It suggests that the judgment against Ahab's house was inevitable and orchestrated by God, reinforcing the theme of divine sovereignty. This moment also serves to further distance Jehu from the bloodshed, positioning him as a tool of divine justice rather than a mere usurper.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jehu was anointed king of Israel and tasked with eradicating the house of Ahab as part of God's judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab's_family.htm">Ahab's Family</a></b><br>The royal family of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, known for their idolatry and wickedness, which led to God's judgment upon them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezreel.htm">Jezreel</a></b><br>The location where Jehu executed the judgment against Ahab's family, fulfilling the prophecy given by Elijah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Israel who witnessed Jehu's actions and were addressed by him in this passage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_and_servants_of_baal.htm">Prophets and Servants of Baal</a></b><br>Those who were associated with the worship of Baal, which Jehu sought to eliminate from Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>Jehu's actions demonstrate God's control over history and His ability to execute judgment according to His divine plan.
