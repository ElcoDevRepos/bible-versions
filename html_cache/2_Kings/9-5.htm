The context is a time of political upheaval and divine judgment against the house of Ahab. The arrival signifies the beginning of a divinely orchestrated change in leadership.<p><b>the army commanders were sitting there</b><br>The army commanders were likely gathered in a strategic meeting, possibly discussing military campaigns against Aram.

The presence of multiple commanders indicates the importance of the message and the need for discretion.<p><b>&#8220;I have a message for you, commander,&#8221; he said</b><br>The young prophet's message is direct and urgent, reflecting the divine authority behind it. The term "commander" acknowledges Jehu's military rank and foreshadows his impending rise to kingship. This approach is consistent with prophetic traditions where messages from God are delivered with authority and purpose.<p><b>&#8220;For which of us?&#8221; asked Jehu</b><br>Jehu's question suggests a level of humility or perhaps caution, as he does not immediately assume the message is for him.
