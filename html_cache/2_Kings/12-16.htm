These offerings were made to atone for specific sins and unintentional transgressions. The guilt offering, or "asham," was typically required when someone had committed a sin against the holy things of the LORD or had wronged another person. The sin offering, or "chatat," was for purification from sin and was necessary for maintaining a right relationship with God. These offerings were integral to the spiritual and communal life of Israel, emphasizing the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement.<p><b>was not brought into the house of the LORD;</b><br>The house of the LORD refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was the central place of worship for the Israelites. It was where sacrifices were offered, and it symbolized God's presence among His people. The fact that the money from these offerings was not brought into the temple indicates a specific allocation of resources. This practice highlights the distinct roles and responsibilities within the temple service and the importance of maintaining the temple's operations and the priesthood's sustenance.<p><b>it belonged to the priests.</b><br>The priests, descendants of Aaron, were responsible for performing the sacrifices and maintaining the temple rituals. According to the Law, they were entitled to certain portions of the offerings as their livelihood (<a href="/leviticus/6-26.htm">Leviticus 6:26, 7</a>:7). This provision ensured that the priests could dedicate themselves fully to their sacred duties without the distraction of seeking other means of support. This system underscores the principle of providing for those who serve in spiritual leadership, a concept echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>). The allocation of these offerings to the priests also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's provision for His servants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoash.htm">Jehoash (Joash)</a></b><br>King of Judah who initiated repairs to the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders responsible for temple duties and receiving offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_of_the_lord.htm">Temple of the LORD</a></b><br>The central place of worship in Jerusalem, requiring maintenance and repair.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/guilt_offerings_and_sin_offerings.htm">Guilt Offerings and Sin Offerings</a></b><br>Specific sacrifices prescribed in the Law of Moses for atonement and purification.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_the_lord.htm">House of the LORD</a></b><br>Another term for the temple, emphasizing its sacred purpose.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_offerings.htm">Understanding Offerings</a></b><br>The guilt and sin offerings were distinct from other contributions, emphasizing the need for atonement and reconciliation with God.

Here, the focus narrows to a specific pool of funds&#8212;cash redeemed from certain sacrifices rather than coins freely given.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13&#8211;16</a> shows that monetary equivalents for offerings were common, so the verse assumes the people were paying in silver instead of livestock.<p>&#8226; By naming &#8220;the money,&#8221; Scripture reminds us that even currency tied to worship must follow God&#8217;s ordering, not human improvisation (cf. <a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1&#8211;4</a> for the danger of mishandling dedicated funds).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the guilt offerings and sin offerings</b><p>&#8226;

Each of these sacrifices had a dual purpose: reconciliation with God and provision for His servants.<p>&#8226; By pointing to these two offerings here, the writer stresses that not every temple&#8208;related gift was earmarked for building projects; some had a distinct destination set by the Law (<a href="/leviticus/7-7.htm">Leviticus 7:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was not brought into the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Unlike the renovation money delivered to &#8220;the house of the LORD&#8221;

The phrase underscores financial accountability: Joash&#8217;s administrators separated funds immediately so no one could &#8220;borrow&#8221; from the priests&#8217; share.<p>&#8226; Clear lines guard against confusion and temptation, reflecting Paul&#8217;s later call to &#8220;take pains to do what is right, not only before the Lord but also before men&#8221;

This allocation freed priests to focus on teaching and mediating, a principle echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13&#8211;14</a>, where Paul cites temple service to defend pastoral support.<p>&#8226;
