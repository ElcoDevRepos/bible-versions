His command to let the bones rest reflects his respect for the prophets and the sacredness of their mission. This action aligns with Josiah's commitment to purging idolatry and honoring true worship, as seen in his broader reforms (<a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-25</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Do not let anyone disturb his bones.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of respecting the dead, particularly those who served God faithfully. In ancient Israel, disturbing graves was considered a serious offense, as it violated the sanctity of the deceased. Josiah's directive may also reflect a belief in the future resurrection, a theme that appears in later Jewish thought and is echoed in Christian teachings about the resurrection of the dead (<a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, <a href="/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28-29</a>).<p><b>So they left his bones undisturbed,</b><br>The obedience to Josiah's command indicates the respect and authority he held as king. It also highlights the fulfillment of the prophecy given in <a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>, where a man of God from Judah prophesied against the altar at Bethel, predicting Josiah's actions. This fulfillment of prophecy serves as a testament to the reliability of God's word.<p><b>along with those of the prophet who had come from Samaria.</b><br>The prophet from Samaria refers to the man of God who had earlier prophesied against the altar at Bethel (<a href="/1_kings/13.htm">1 Kings 13:1-32</a>). His inclusion in the narrative emphasizes the unity of God's message across the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience, as this prophet was deceived and met an untimely death, yet his bones were honored due to his initial faithfulness. This act of leaving the bones undisturbed can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also a prophet not fully recognized in His time but honored posthumously.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore the worship of Yahweh and eliminate idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophet_from_judah.htm">The Prophet from Judah</a></b><br>A man of God who had previously prophesied against the altar at Bethel, as recorded in <a href="/bsb/1_kings/13.htm">1 Kings 13</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophet_from_samaria.htm">The Prophet from Samaria</a></b><br>A prophet who had come from Samaria and was buried alongside the prophet from Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant religious site in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, where Jeroboam had set up a golden calf.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah's_reforms.htm">Josiah's Reforms</a></b><br>The religious reforms led by King Josiah, which included the destruction of idolatrous sites and the restoration of true worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_god's_servants.htm">Respect for God's Servants</a></b><br>Josiah's command to leave the bones of the prophets undisturbed shows respect for those who faithfully served God, even after their death.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>The preservation of the prophets' bones fulfills the prophecy given in <a href="/bsb/1_kings/13.htm">1 Kings 13</a>, demonstrating God's faithfulness to His word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_true_worship.htm">The Importance of True Worship</a></b><br>Josiah's reforms emphasize the need to worship God in truth, removing any form of idolatry or false worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_of_faithfulness.htm">Legacy of Faithfulness</a></b><br>The account encourages believers to leave a legacy of faithfulness that honors God and impacts future generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_history.htm">God's Sovereignty in History</a></b><br>The events surrounding Josiah's reforms remind us of God's sovereign control over history and His ability to bring about His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_23_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 23:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_23_18_Respect_for_God_s_servants.htm">How does 2 Kings 23:18 demonstrate respect for the faithful servants of God?
