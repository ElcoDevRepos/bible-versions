In biblical times, rising early was often associated with diligence and readiness for action. The early morning light can symbolize new beginnings or divine intervention. In the context of this passage, it marks the moment before a miraculous event unfolds, reminiscent of other biblical narratives where God acts at dawn, such as the crossing of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27</a>).<p><b>the sun was shining on the water</b><br>The sun's reflection on the water is a natural phenomenon that plays a crucial role in the unfolding events. This detail highlights the importance of God's creation in His plans. The sun, often a symbol of God's glory and presence, here becomes an instrument in His strategy. The water, provided miraculously in the desert (<a href="/2_kings/3-20.htm">2 Kings 3:20</a>), is now used to deceive the Moabites, showcasing God's sovereignty over nature.<p><b>and it looked as red as blood</b><br>The appearance of the water as blood is a pivotal moment in the narrative. This optical illusion is reminiscent of the first plague in Egypt, where the Nile turned to blood (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>). It serves as a divine tactic to confuse and mislead the Moabites. Blood is often associated with judgment and sacrifice in the Bible, foreshadowing the coming defeat of the Moabites and pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, whose blood brings redemption.<p><b>to the Moabites across the way</b><br>The Moabites, descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>), were often in conflict with Israel. Their position "across the way" indicates their readiness for battle, yet they are deceived by what they see. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using the plans of His enemies against them, as seen in stories like that of Haman in Esther. The Moabites' misinterpretation of the scene underscores the futility of opposing God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moabites.htm">Moabites</a></b><br>A nation descended from Moab, the son of Lot.

Here, a new phase of the battle is about to unfold exactly on God&#8217;s timetable, not Israel&#8217;s.<p>&#8226; Earlier, the allied army had obeyed Elisha&#8217;s word to &#8220;dig this valley full of ditches&#8221; (v. 16). They went to sleep with empty trenches; they wake to God&#8217;s provision. That pattern mirrors <a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-27</a>, where Israel rests and wakes to see the Lord fight for them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the sun was shining on the water</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; the sun was shining on the water &#8230;&#8221; (v. 22b)<p>&#8226; Overnight, the Lord had sent water &#8220;from the direction of Edom&#8221; (v. 20). What had been a scorched wilderness is now glistening with pools.<p>&#8226; The sunrise turns every trench into a mirror. God uses natural elements&#8212;sunlight and water&#8212;to accomplish supernatural strategy, echoing <a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12-14</a>, where the sun itself participates in Israel&#8217;s victory.<p>&#8226; Israel and Judah see life-giving water; Moab is about to see something entirely different. The same provision that blesses one side confounds the other (compare <a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24-25</a>, where the pillar of fire lights Israel&#8217;s path but throws Egypt into confusion).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it looked as red as blood to the Moabites across the way</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; and it looked as red as blood to the Moabites across the way.&#8221; (v. 22c)<p>&#8226; From Moab&#8217;s distant vantage point, the reddish hue of the rising sun refracts off the water-filled ditches, producing the illusion of a valley strewn with blood.<p>&#8226; Moab immediately leaps to a false conclusion: &#8220;This is blood! The kings have fought and slaughtered each other&#8221; (v. 23). Self-confidence blinds them (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Believing the battle already won, they rush in unarmored to plunder&#8212;and run straight into a ready Israelite force (vv. 24-25). The Lord turns their misinterpretation into Israel&#8217;s decisive advantage, recalling <a href="/judges/7-21.htm">Judges 7:21-22</a>, where Gideon&#8217;s enemies destroy themselves in confusion.<p>&#8226; The episode underscores <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>: God chooses &#8220;the foolish things of the world to shame the wise.&#8221; What looks like certain victory to Moab is God&#8217;s setup for their defeat.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God orchestrates simple elements&#8212;morning light on freshly provided water&#8212;to mislead Moab and deliver His people. By rising early, supplying water, and allowing an optical illusion, He proves that victory belongs to Him alone (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). <a href="/2_kings/3-22.htm">2 Kings 3:22</a> teaches that obedience to God&#8217;s word, even when it seems mundane (digging ditches), positions us to witness His power, while prideful assumptions invite downfall.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">They rose up early.</span>--The Moabite camp on the frontier mountains.<p><span class= "bld">And the sun shone upon the water.</span>--A parenthesis (<span class= "ital">now the sun had risen upon the water</span>).

A ruddy sunrise is common in the East, more especially in stormy weather (see <a href="/matthew/16-3.htm">Matthew 16:3</a>); and the red light, falling upon the water in the pits, and reflected thence to the opposite side of the wady, would quite sufficiently account for the mistake of the Moabites, without supposing that the water was actually stained and discolored. The Moabites concluded that the red-looking liquid was blood, from knowing that the wady was dry the day before, and from not suspecting that there had been any change in the night, as the storm which had caused the change was at such a distance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/3-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When they got up early</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#353;&#183;k&#238;&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
