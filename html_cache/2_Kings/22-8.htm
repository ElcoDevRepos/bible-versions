His interaction with Shaphan, a scribe and royal secretary, highlights the collaboration between religious and governmental authorities. This partnership was crucial for the implementation of religious reforms. Shaphan's role as a scribe indicates his literacy and authority in matters of state and religion, reflecting the importance of written records in ancient Judah.<p><b>&#8220;I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD!&#8221;</b><br>The discovery of the Book of the Law, likely a form of Deuteronomy, was a pivotal moment in Judah's history. The "house of the LORD" refers to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship. This finding suggests that the Law had been neglected or lost during previous reigns, possibly due to idolatrous practices. The rediscovery signifies a divine intervention to restore covenantal faithfulness. The Book of the Law served as a foundation for King Josiah's reforms, emphasizing the importance of Scripture in guiding the nation.<p><b>And he gave it to Shaphan, who read it.</b><br>Hilkiah's decision to give the book to Shaphan underscores the trust and responsibility placed on the scribe. Shaphan's reading of the text indicates the oral tradition of disseminating important documents, ensuring that the king and his court were informed. This act of reading also symbolizes the reintroduction of God's commandments to the people, setting the stage for national repentance and reform.

The definite form of the expression proves that what the high priest found was something already known; it was not a book, but <span class= "ital">the</span> book of the Law. How little the critics are agreed as to the precise character and contents of the book in question is well shown by Thenius: "Neither the entire then existing Scripture (Sebastian Schmidt), nor the Pentateuch (Josephus, Clericus, Von Lengerke, Keil, Bahr,) nor the ordered collection of Mosaic laws contained in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers (Bertheau), nor the book of Exodus (Gramberg), nor the book of Deuteronomy (Reuss, Ewald, Hitzig) is to be understood by this expression. All these must have been brought into their present shape at a later time. What is meant is a <span class= "ital">collection of the statutes and ordinances of Moses</span>, which has been worked up (<span class= "ital">verarbeitet</span>) in the Pentateuch, and especially in Deuteronomy. This work is referred to by Jeremiah (<a href="/context/jeremiah/11-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying,">Jeremiah 11:1-17</a>),and was called "The Book of the Covenant" (<a href="/2_kings/23-2.htm" title="And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.">2Kings 23:2</a>).

When after half a century of disuse it was found again by the high priest in going through the chambers of the Temple with a view to the intended repairs, in the Ark which, though cast aside, was still kept in the Temple, it appeared like something <span class= "ital">new</span>, because it had been wholly forgotten (for a time), so that Shaphan could say: 'Hilkiah has given me <span class= "ital">a book</span>' (<a href="/2_kings/22-10.htm" title="And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book.

When Shaphan had transacted with Hilkiah the business entrusted to him by the king, Hilkiah took the opportunity of sending word by him to the king with respect to a discovery that he had recently made, during the investigations connected with the repairs. He had found a book, which he called without any doubt or hesitation, "the book of the Law" - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> - and this book he put into the hands of Shaphan, who "read it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> some of it, and found it of such importance that he took it back with him to the palace, and read a portion to the king. Hereupon the king "rent his clothes," and required that special inquiry should be made of the Lord concerning the words of the book, and particularly concerning the threatenings contained in it. The persons entrusted with this task thought it best to lay the matter before Huldah, a prophetess, who lived in Jerusalem at the time, and pro-seeded to confer with her at her residence. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the Law in the house of the Lord.</span> There has been great difference of opinion as to what it was which Hilkiah had found. Ewald believes it to have been the Book of Deuteronomy, which had, he thinks, been composed some thirty or forty years before in Egypt by a Jewish exile, and had found its way, <span class="accented">by a sort of chance</span>, into Palestine, where "some <span class="accented">priest"</span> had placed a copy of it in the temple ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. pp. 233-235). Thenius suggests "a collection of the laws and ordinances of Moses, which was afterwards worked up into the Pentateuch;" Bertheau, "the three middle books of the Pentateuch, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers;" Gramberg, "Exodus by itself." But there seem to be no sufficient grounds for questioning the ancient opinion - that of Josephus, and of the Jews generally - that it was a copy of the entire Pentateuch. (So De Wette, 'Einleitung in das Alt. Test.,' &sect; 162 <span class="accented">a</span>; Keil, 'Commentary on Kings,' pp. 477, 478; Bahr, 'Commentary,' vol. 6. p. 257; and others). The words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "the <span class="accented">book</span> of the Law," are really sufficient to decide the point; since, as Keil says, they "cannot mean anything else, either grammatically or historically, than the Mosaic book of the Law (the Pentateuch), which is so designated, as is generally admitted, in the Chronicles and the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah." The same conclusion follows from the expression, "the book of the covenant" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5df;&#x5df;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>), in <a href="/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a>, and also from <a href="/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24, 25</a>, and <a href="/2_chronicles/34-14.htm">2 Chronicles 34:14</a>. Whether or no the copy was the actual original deposited in the ark of the covenant by Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>), as Keil believes, is doubtful. As Egyptian manuscripts which are from three to four thousand years old still exist in good condition, there can be no reason why a manuscript of Moses' time should not have been found and have been legible in Josiah's. But, if not the actual handwriting of Moses, it was probably its lineal descendant - the copy made for the temple service, and kept ordinarily "in the side of the ark" - which may well have been lost in the time of Manasseh or Amen, and which was now happily "found." <span class="cmt_word">And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</span> We need not suppose that Shaphan read the whole. But he read enough to show him how important the work was, and how necessary it was to make it known to the king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/22-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Hilkiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;il&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2518.htm">Strong's 2518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hilkiah -- 'my portion is Yah', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the high</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
