Jehu was known for his zeal in eradicating the house of Ahab and the worship of Baal, as commanded by God. However, his failure to fully turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, such as the worship of golden calves, set the stage for divine judgment.<p><b>the LORD began to reduce the size of Israel.</b><br>This indicates a divine intervention where God allowed Israel's territory to be diminished as a consequence of their continued idolatry and disobedience. The reduction of Israel's size can be seen as a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience would lead to loss of land and blessings. This serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the importance of faithfulness to His commandments.<p><b>Hazael defeated the Israelites</b><br>Hazael was the king of Aram (Syria) and a significant adversary of Israel during this time. His rise to power was prophesied by Elisha in <a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12-13</a>, where he was foretold to bring destruction upon Israel. Hazael's military campaigns against Israel were part of God's judgment, using foreign nations as instruments to discipline His people, similar to how He used the Assyrians and Babylonians later in history.<p><b>throughout their territory</b><br>The phrase indicates the widespread nature of Hazael's victories, affecting the entire northern kingdom of Israel. This territorial loss included significant regions such as Gilead and Bashan, which were east of the Jordan River. These areas were historically important for Israel, both strategically and economically, and their loss would have been a severe blow to the nation's stability and prosperity. This also foreshadows the eventual downfall and exile of the northern kingdom, which occurred in 722 BC under the Assyrian Empire.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is actively involved in the affairs of His people, often using other nations as instruments of judgment or blessing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, distinct from Judah, which was experiencing a period of decline due to disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hazael.htm">Hazael</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria), who was used by God as an instrument of judgment against Israel.

The verse underscores divine sovereignty, the reality of covenant consequences, and the steadfast purpose of God: to draw His people back while preserving a remnant for His promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">In those days.</span>--As a vassal and ally of Assyria (see Notes on <a href="/2_kings/9-2.htm" title="And when you come thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner chamber;">2Kings 9:2</a>), Jehu drew upon himself the active hostility of Hazael. (See Note on <a href="/2_kings/8-15.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.">2Kings 8:15</a>.) Schr&#8221;der remarks that it was quite natural for the Israelite sovereign to "throw himself into the arms of distant Assyria, in order to get protection against his immediate neighbour Syria, Israel's hereditary foe." Comp. the similar conduct of Ahaz as against Pekah and Rezin (<a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm" title="So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.">2Kings 16:7</a>). From the point of view of the sacred writer, this verse states the <span class= "ital">consequence</span> of Jehu's neglect of "walking in Jehovah's instruction with all his heart" (<a href="/2_kings/10-31.htm" title="But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.">2Kings 10:31</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The Lord began.</span>--Through Hazael and the Syrians. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/7-17.htm" title="The LORD shall bring on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.">Isaiah 7:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-20.htm" title="In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.">Isaiah 7:20</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/10-5.htm" title="O Assyrian, the rod of my anger, and the staff in their hand is my indignation.">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32-36.</span> <span class="accented">- Jehu's wars</span>, <span class="accented">length of reign</span>, <span class="accented">and successor</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In those days the Lord began to out Israel short.</span> It is certainly not stated in direct terms that the ill success of Jehu's foreign wars was a punishment on him for his continued maintenance of the calf-idolatry; but the juxtaposition of vers. 31 and 32 naturally raises the idea, and constitutes a strong presumption that it was in the writer's mind. The "theocracy" under the kings was carried on mainly, as the writer of Chronicles clearly saw, by the bestowal of worldly prosperity and military success on good kings, and the accumulation of misfortunes and military disasters on bad ones (see <a href="/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5-12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4-18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2-15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2-15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-5</a>. etc.). By "cutting Israel short" - literally, "cutting off in Israel" - is probably meant the conquest of certain portions of the territory.
