In the biblical context, barrenness was often seen as a significant challenge and a source of social stigma. The miraculous conception parallels other biblical accounts, such as Sarah (<a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-2</a>) and Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19-20</a>), where God intervenes to fulfill His promises. This event underscores God's power to bring life and fulfill His word through His prophets.<p><b>and at that time the next year</b><br>The specific timing emphasizes the accuracy and reliability of prophetic words. In the ancient Near Eastern context, time was often marked by agricultural cycles, and the phrase suggests a full cycle of seasons. This precise fulfillment of prophecy reinforces the authority of Elisha as a true prophet of God, whose words are trustworthy and come to pass as spoken.<p><b>she gave birth to a son</b><br>The birth of a son was particularly significant in ancient Israelite culture, as sons were seen as carriers of the family lineage and inheritors of the family estate. This birth not only brought personal joy to the woman and her husband but also had broader implications for their social standing and future security. The son can be seen as a type of Christ, a miraculous child who brings hope and fulfills divine promises.<p><b>just as Elisha had told her</b><br>This phrase confirms the fulfillment of Elisha's prophecy, highlighting the role of prophets as God's messengers. Elisha, as a successor to Elijah, continues the prophetic tradition of speaking God's truth and demonstrating His power. The fulfillment of his words serves to authenticate his ministry and the divine source of his message. This also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His promises, as seen throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah.
