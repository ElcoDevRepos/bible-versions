In biblical times, a cloak was often a symbol of one's office or calling. Elijah's mantle falling to Elisha signifies the transfer of prophetic leadership. This act fulfills Elijah's earlier calling of Elisha in <a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>, where Elijah threw his cloak over Elisha, indicating his selection as a successor. The mantle is a type of Christ's authority, as Jesus also passed on His authority to His disciples (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>).<p><b>and he went back</b><br>Elisha's return signifies the continuation of Elijah's ministry. It highlights the theme of succession and the perpetuation of God's work through chosen individuals. This mirrors the transition seen in the New Testament, where Jesus' disciples continue His mission after His ascension (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>and stood on the bank of the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River is a significant geographical and spiritual landmark in Israel's history. It represents a place of transition and transformation, as seen in the Israelites' crossing into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>) and Jesus' baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>). Elisha standing on its bank symbolizes a moment of decision and the beginning of his prophetic ministry. The Jordan serves as a boundary between the old and the new, much like the transition from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet and the successor of Elijah.

Earlier, Elijah had &#8220;threw his cloak around him&#8221; when he first called Elisha (<a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>), so its transfer now confirms the passing of the ministry.<p>&#8226; God had literally allowed the cloak to drop as Elijah was taken heavenward (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11&#8211;12</a>). Its presence on the ground shows that the Lord provides tangible evidence of His calling.<p>&#8226; Like Moses sharing his spirit with the seventy elders (<a href="/numbers/11-17.htm">Numbers 11:17</a>) and Jesus promising, &#8220;You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>), the cloak signals that spiritual authority is both real and transferable by God&#8217;s design.<p>&#8226; Elisha&#8217;s quick action&#8212;he &#8220;picked up&#8221; the cloak&#8212;demonstrates readiness. There is no delay, no self-doubt, just obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he went back</b><p>&#8226; Elisha retraces the steps he and Elijah had just taken (<a href="/2_kings/2-8.htm">2 Kings 2:8</a>). The journey back signifies continuity: the God who worked through Elijah will now work through Elisha.<p>&#8226; Returning also positions Elisha to serve the very people who had watched him cross earlier, much like Jesus &#8220;returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit&#8221; after His temptation (<a href="/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Going back is not regression; it is purposeful. God often sends His servants to familiar ground to begin a new chapter (<a href="/john/21-6.htm">John 21:6</a>, when the risen Jesus meets the disciples at the old fishing spot).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and stood on the bank of the Jordan</b><p>&#8226; Elisha pauses at the edge. Before acting, he stands&#8212;a stance of faith and expectation, echoing &#8220;Stand firm, and you will see the LORD&#8217;s salvation&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The Jordan is a boundary river. Joshua&#8217;s priests once &#8220;stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan&#8221; as all Israel crossed (<a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>). Elisha now stands in the same arena, ready to witness another crossing miracle.<p>&#8226; His posture mirrors the armor passage: &#8220;having done everything, to stand&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>). Faith stands on God&#8217;s promise before it moves in God&#8217;s power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/2-13.htm">2 Kings 2:13</a> records a literal, historical moment where God publicly transfers prophetic authority from Elijah to Elisha. By picking up the fallen cloak, retracing his steps, and taking his stand at the Jordan, Elisha embraces his God-given calling. The verse teaches that the Lord provides unmistakable confirmation of His appointments, sends His servants back to serve in power, and invites them to stand in faith before acting. The same God who empowered Elijah now equips Elisha&#8212;and still equips all who obediently take up the mantle assigned to them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">The mantle of Elijah.</span>--See <a href="/2_kings/2-8.htm" title="And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided here and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.">2Kings 2:8</a>, and comp. <a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm" title="So he departed there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle on him.">1Kings 19:19</a>.
