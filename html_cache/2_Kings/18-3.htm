In the context of the Kings of Judah, doing "what was right in the eyes of the LORD" signifies adherence to the covenantal laws and commandments given to Israel. Hezekiah's actions are contrasted with many of his predecessors who led the nation into idolatry and disobedience. This phrase underscores the importance of divine approval over human judgment. It reflects the Deuteronomic history's emphasis on covenant faithfulness as the standard for kingship. Hezekiah's reforms, including the removal of high places and the destruction of idols, align with this evaluation.<p><b>just as his father David had done</b><br>David is often used as the benchmark for righteous kingship in the biblical narrative. Although Hezekiah was not a direct son of David, he is considered a descendant in the Davidic line, which is significant for the messianic prophecies concerning the lineage of Christ. David's heart for God and his role as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>) set a standard for future kings. Hezekiah's comparison to David highlights his commitment to restoring true worship and reliance on God, similar to David's own devotion. This connection also points to the messianic hope that a king from David's line would ultimately fulfill God's promises to Israel, a hope realized in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned during a time of significant reform and spiritual renewal.

Hezekiah is not merely described by his intentions; he moves. Scripture consistently honors obedience that shows up in deeds (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>; <a href="/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46&#8211;48</a>). In <a href="/bsb/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29&#8211;31</a> we watch him repair the temple, restore the priests, and reinstate Passover&#8212;all verbs, all movement. Such activity echoes Joshua&#8217;s earlier call to &#8220;be careful to do according to all the law&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>). The verse&#8217;s first words remind us that godliness is visible, measurable, and practical.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what was right</b><p>&#8220;Right&#8221; is not culturally defined; it is measured against God&#8217;s revealed standards. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-18.htm">Deuteronomy 6:18</a> commands, &#8220;Do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD.&#8221; Hezekiah purged idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>), an act that fit God&#8217;s law (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3&#8211;5</a>). Righteousness here is moral alignment with God&#8217;s character, not self&#8211;styled virtue (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>). The text underscores that true reform always traces back to Scripture rather than personal preference or political expediency (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the eyes of the LORD</b><p>What matters is God&#8217;s viewpoint, not the shifting opinions of people. <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a> states, &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are in every place, observing the evil and the good.&#8221; When leaders like Saul sought public approval, they fell (<a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24</a>). Hezekiah&#8217;s concern mirrors David&#8217;s prayer, &#8220;Search me, O God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23&#8211;24</a>). Living before God&#8217;s gaze brings both accountability and assurance (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>). It steadies believers who must sometimes choose fidelity over popularity (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as his father David had done</b><p>Though David lived centuries earlier, he remains the benchmark for covenant faithfulness. <a href="/1_kings/15-5.htm">1 Kings 15:5</a> summarizes his life: &#8220;David did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and did not turn aside from anything He commanded him all the days of his life.&#8221; By tying Hezekiah to David, the writer links the king to messianic hope (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>) and highlights a restored continuity with God&#8217;s covenant line (<a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22&#8211;23</a>). Hezekiah&#8217;s reforms therefore echo deeper promises that will culminate in the greater Son of David (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3</a> celebrates a king whose concrete actions matched God&#8217;s standards, whose audience was God alone, and whose life rekindled the Davidic ideal. Hezekiah&#8217;s obedience shows that genuine righteousness is active, anchored in Scripture, and accountable to the Lord&#8217;s penetrating gaze, offering believers today a clear model for wholehearted devotion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that David his father did.</span> Such unqualified praise is only assigned to two other kings of Judah - Asa (<a href="/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11</a>) and Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/22-2.htm">2 Kings 22:2</a>). It is curious that all three were the sons of wicked fathers. Hezekiah was probably, at an early age, Brought under the influence of Isaiah, who was on familiar terms with his father Ahaz (<a href="/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3-16</a>), and would be likely to do all that lay in his power to turn Hezekiah from his father's evil ways, and to foster all the germs of good in his character. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/18-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
