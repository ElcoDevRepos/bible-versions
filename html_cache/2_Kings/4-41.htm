In this instance, the use of flour is significant. Flour, a staple food, symbolizes sustenance and life. This act can be seen as a precursor to the miracles of Jesus, such as the feeding of the 5,000, where simple elements are used to provide for many. The use of flour also connects to the idea of God using ordinary means to accomplish extraordinary purposes.<p><b>He threw it into the pot and said,</b><br>The act of throwing flour into the pot signifies a divine intervention. In the context of ancient Israel, prophets were seen as mediators of God's will. Elisha's actions demonstrate his role as a conduit for God's miraculous power. This moment reflects the authority given to prophets to act on God's behalf, similar to how Jesus performed miracles to reveal His divine authority.<p><b>&#8220;Pour it out for the people to eat.&#8221;</b><br>This command reflects Elisha's confidence in God's provision. The people were in need, and Elisha's instruction to serve the food shows faith that God had removed the danger. This mirrors the biblical theme of God's provision in times of need, as seen in the manna provided to the Israelites in the wilderness. It also foreshadows the Last Supper, where Jesus provides spiritual nourishment through the breaking of bread.<p><b>And there was nothing harmful in the pot.</b><br>The removal of harm from the pot signifies God's power to purify and protect. This miracle reassures the people of God's care and ability to transform what is dangerous into something safe. It highlights the theme of redemption and restoration found throughout Scripture, where God turns situations of peril into opportunities for His glory. This act of purification can be seen as a type of Christ, who purifies and redeems humanity from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet and successor of Elijah, known for performing miracles and guiding the people of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_the_prophets.htm">The Sons of the Prophets</a></b><br>A group of prophetic disciples who were under the mentorship of Elisha.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pot_of_stew.htm">The Pot of Stew</a></b><br>A meal prepared by the sons of the prophets that became harmful due to the inclusion of wild gourds.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilgal.htm">Gilgal</a></b><br>The location where this event took place, a significant site in Israel's history.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle_of_purification.htm">The Miracle of Purification</a></b><br>Elisha's act of adding flour to the pot, which neutralized the poison and made the stew safe to eat.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_protection.htm">God's Provision and Protection</a></b><br>Just as Elisha purified the stew, God provides for and protects His people from harm.

Thenius, however, supposes that "the meal softened the bitterness, and obviated the drastic effect." But Reuss appears to be right in saying, "by mistake a poisonous (not merely a bitter) plant had been put into the pot, and the prophet neutralises the poison by means of an antidote <span class= "ital">whose natural</span> properties could never have had that effect." The "meal" here, therefore, corresponds to the "salt" in <a href="/2_kings/2-21.htm" title="And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus said the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or barren land.">2Kings 2:21</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And he said, Pour out.</span>--The LXX. adds, "to Gehazi, his servant;" probably a gloss.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he said, Then bring meal</span>. Elisha seems not to have hesitated for a moment. Prompt measures must be taken, if poisoning is even suspected. He has meal brought - not that meal has any virtue in itself against colocynth, or against any other deleterious drug. But he acts, now as always, under Divine direction, and is instructed to use meal on this occasion, as he used salt in healing the waters of Jericho. The meal, as Keil observes, "might somewhat modify the bitterness and injurious qualities of the vegetable," whatever it was, but "could not possibly take them entirely away. The meal, the most wholesome food of man, was only the earthly substratum for the working of the Divine effluence which proceeded from Elisha, and made the noxious food perfectly wholesome." <span class="cmt_word">And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out now for the people</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the assembled company of sons of the prophets - <span class="cmt_word">that they may eat.
