His frustration with Elisha's prophetic insight into his military plans led him to take direct action. This reflects the common practice of ancient kings to personally direct military and strategic operations.<p><b>&#8220;Go and see where he is,</b><br>The king's command to locate Elisha indicates the importance of intelligence and reconnaissance in ancient warfare. It also highlights the perceived threat Elisha posed due to his prophetic abilities, which were seen as a divine advantage for Israel.<p><b>that I may send men to capture him.&#8221;</b><br>The intent to capture Elisha shows the king's misunderstanding of the source of Elisha's power. This mirrors other biblical narratives where human leaders attempt to thwart divine plans, such as Pharaoh's pursuit of the Israelites (Exodus 14). It also foreshadows the futility of opposing God's anointed servants.<p><b>On receiving the report,</b><br>This suggests a network of informants or spies, common in ancient Near Eastern politics. The king's reliance on such a network underscores the strategic importance of intelligence in maintaining power and control.<p><b>&#8220;Elisha is in Dothan,&#8221;</b><br>Dothan is a significant location, mentioned earlier in <a href="/genesis/37-17.htm">Genesis 37:17</a> as the place where Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers. It is situated in the northern part of the central hill country of Israel.
