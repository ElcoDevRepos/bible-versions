His visits were significant as they often brought divine insight or intervention. The phrase "one day" suggests a specific, divinely appointed time, emphasizing God's timing in the unfolding of events. Elisha's travels reflect the itinerant nature of prophets during this period, who moved among the people to deliver God's messages. This visit is to the Shunammite woman, a notable figure of hospitality and faith, highlighting the importance of hospitality in ancient Near Eastern culture.<p><b>and went to his upper room</b><br>The "upper room" was a common architectural feature in ancient Israelite homes, often used for guests or special purposes. It was typically a quiet, private space, separate from the main living areas, indicating a place of rest and reflection. The provision of an upper room by the Shunammite woman and her husband for Elisha demonstrates their respect and reverence for the man of God. This act of hospitality is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where prophets and messengers of God are provided with shelter, such as the widow of Zarephath with Elijah.<p><b>to lie down</b><br>Elisha's action of lying down suggests a need for rest, indicating the physical demands of his prophetic ministry. It also symbolizes a moment of peace and respite, which can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual rest in God's presence. This moment of rest precedes the miraculous events that follow, where Elisha will later prophesy the birth of a son to the Shunammite woman. The act of lying down in the upper room can also be seen as a precursor to the resurrection theme, as Elisha later uses this room to raise the Shunammite's son from the dead, foreshadowing the resurrection power of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God, successor to Elijah, known for performing miracles and being a spiritual leader in Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shunem.htm">Shunem</a></b><br>A town in the territory of Issachar, where a notable woman provided hospitality to Elisha.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/upper_room.htm">Upper Room</a></b><br>A special room prepared by the Shunammite woman and her husband for Elisha to use whenever he visited.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/hospitality_as_a_ministry.htm">Hospitality as a Ministry</a></b><br>The Shunammite woman's provision of an upper room for Elisha demonstrates the importance of hospitality in serving God's purposes.

Nothing in the believer&#8217;s life is random; God orchestrates even the simplest moments to further His purposes. Much as in <a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8</a>&#8212;&#8220;One day Elisha went to Shunem&#8221;&#8212;this phrase alerts us that the Lord is about to unveil another facet of His care for His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Elisha came to visit</b><p>The prophet accepts the ongoing hospitality of the Shunammite family, illustrating the mutual blessing that flows when God&#8217;s servants and His people honor one another (<a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-41.htm">Matthew 10:41</a>). Elisha&#8217;s presence turns their home into a place of divine encounter, echoing Elijah&#8217;s stay with the widow of Zarephath in <a href="/1_kings/17-8.htm">1 Kings 17:8&#8211;16</a>. The visit reminds us that godly relationships are channels through which the Lord releases provision and revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Went to his upper room</b><p>Verse 10 explained that the family had built &#8220;a small room on the roof and put in it a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp for him.&#8221; This upper room is a tangible token of reverence for God&#8217;s Word spoken through His prophet. Throughout Scripture, upper rooms serve as spaces where heaven meets earth&#8212;Jesus shared the Passover there (<a href="/luke/22-12.htm">Luke 22:12&#8211;13</a>), the disciples prayed there after the Ascension (<a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13&#8211;14</a>), and Peter raised Dorcas there (<a href="/acts/9-37.htm">Acts 9:37&#8211;40</a>). By retreating to this prepared place, Elisha models the necessity of withdrawing for communion and rest (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To lie down</b><p>The text concludes, &#8220;and went to his upper room to lie down.&#8221; Rest is God&#8217;s gift to His laborers (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>; <a href="/mark/6-31.htm">Mark 6:31</a>). Elisha&#8217;s lying down is not idleness but a deliberate pause that positions him to hear God concerning the next step&#8212;soon he will summon Gehazi and ask what might be done for the Shunammite, leading to the promise of a son (<a href="/2_kings/4-12.htm">2 Kings 4:12&#8211;17</a>). The scene underscores <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>: the Lord &#8220;makes me lie down in green pastures,&#8221; providing renewal so ministry can flow from overflow, not exhaustion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/4-11.htm">2 Kings 4:11</a> shows the seamless weave of God&#8217;s sovereignty and everyday life. A seemingly routine day becomes the stage for divine provision, because faithful hospitality meets a prophet&#8217;s need for rest, and a rested prophet is ready to become God&#8217;s channel of blessing. The verse invites believers to recognize that God assigns meaning to every ordinary moment, uses mutual care to advance His purposes, and provides sacred spaces and holy rest so His work can continue in power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And it fell on a day.</span>--See Note on <a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm" title="And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread.
