The king of Israel at this time was likely Jehoram, son of Ahab and Jezebel, who continued in the idolatrous practices of his parents. Elisha's interaction with the king highlights the tension between the true prophets of God and the corrupt leadership of Israel.<p><b>&#8220;What have we to do with each other?</b><br>This phrase indicates a clear separation between Elisha, a man of God, and the idolatrous king. It reflects the biblical principle of not being unequally yoked with unbelievers (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). Elisha's question underscores the incompatibility between the worship of Yahweh and the idolatry practiced by the king.<p><b>Go to the prophets of your father and of your mother!&#8221;</b><br>Elisha refers to the false prophets who served Ahab and Jezebel, notorious for leading Israel into Baal worship. This statement is a rebuke, reminding the king of his family's history of idolatry and the futility of seeking guidance from false gods. It echoes Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18).<p><b>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the king of Israel,</b><br>The king's response indicates desperation and acknowledgment of the true power of Yahweh, despite his previous reliance on false prophets. This moment of crisis reveals the king's recognition that only the God of Israel can deliver them, similar to how people often turn to God in times of trouble.<p><b>&#8220;for it is the LORD who has summoned these three kings</b><br>The king attributes the gathering of the three kings&#8212;Israel, Judah, and Edom&#8212;to the LORD's will. This reflects a belief in divine sovereignty, where God orchestrates events for His purposes. It also shows a partial understanding of God's involvement in the affairs of nations, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>to deliver them into the hand of Moab.&#8221;</b><br>The king fears that their campaign against Moab, led by King Mesha, is doomed to fail. This reflects the historical context of the Moabite rebellion against Israelite control after Ahab's death. The king's statement reveals a lack of faith in God's deliverance, contrasting with the faith shown by other biblical figures who trusted in God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God, successor to Elijah, known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel and Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel</a></b><br>Jehoram, son of Ahab and Jezebel, who continued in the idolatrous practices of his parents.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_of_your_father_and_mother.htm">Prophets of your father and mother</a></b><br>Refers to the false prophets of Baal and Asherah, whom Ahab and Jezebel worshipped.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A neighboring nation often in conflict with Israel, led by King Mesha during this time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/three_kings.htm">Three Kings</a></b><br>The alliance of the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom against Moab.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_leadership.htm">Discernment in Leadership</a></b><br>Elisha's response to the king of Israel highlights the need for discernment in whom we seek guidance from.

Jehoram must not be allowed to suppose that he has done enough by his half-repentance and partial reformation; he must be rebuked and shamed, that he may, if possible, be led on to a better frame of mind. "What," says the prophet, "have I to do with thee? What common ground do we occupy? What is there that justifies thee in appealing to me for aid? Get thee to the prophets of thy father" - the four hundred whom Ahab gathered together at Samaria, to advise him as to going up against Ramoth-Gilead (<a href="/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a>) - "and the prophets of thy mother," the Baal-prophets, whom Jezebel, who was still alive, and held the position of queen-mother, still maintained (<a href="/2_kings/10-19.htm">2 Kings 10:19</a>) - "get thee to <span class="accented">them</span>, and consult <span class="accented">them</span>.
