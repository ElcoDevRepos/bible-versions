My head!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates the sudden onset of a severe ailment, possibly a sunstroke, which was common in the hot climate of ancient Israel. The repetition emphasizes the intensity of the pain. In biblical narratives, physical ailments often serve as a precursor to divine intervention or a test of faith. The cry for help reflects human vulnerability and the need for divine assistance, reminiscent of other biblical figures who called out in distress, such as David in the Psalms.<p><b>he complained to his father.</b><br>The child&#8217;s immediate reaction is to seek comfort and assistance from his father, highlighting the familial structure and the role of the father as a protector and provider. This reflects the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, where the father was the head of the household. The father-son relationship is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing the relationship between God the Father and His children, as seen in the parable of the prodigal son.<p><b>So his father told a servant,</b><br>The presence of a servant indicates the family's social status, suggesting they were relatively well-off, as having servants was a sign of wealth. This detail provides insight into the socio-economic conditions of the time. The father's decision to involve a servant shows the delegation of duties within a household, a common practice in ancient cultures. It also reflects the father's immediate concern for his son's well-being, prioritizing swift action.<p><b>&#8220;Carry him to his mother.&#8221;</b><br>The instruction to take the child to his mother underscores the mother's role as a caregiver and nurturer, a common expectation in ancient societies. This action foreshadows the mother's pivotal role in the subsequent narrative, where her faith and determination lead to the miraculous intervention by the prophet Elisha. The mother&#8217;s involvement is crucial, as women in the Bible often symbolize faith and intercession, paralleling figures like Hannah and Mary. The act of carrying the child can be seen as a type of Christ, who bears our burdens and brings us to a place of healing and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_child.htm">The Child</a></b><br>The son of the Shunammite woman, who was miraculously given to her by God through the prophet Elisha.

My head!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The boy&#8217;s doubled cry shows sudden, intense pain&#8212;most likely a heatstroke brought on by working hours in the harvest field (see v. 18). <a href="/psalms/121-6.htm">Psalm 121:6</a> warns, &#8220;The sun will not strike you by day,&#8221; implying that such danger was well known.<p>&#8226; Doubling the phrase underscores urgency; compare Jesus&#8217; &#8220;Truly, truly&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>) for emphasis.<p>&#8226; The repetition also highlights helplessness. Even in youthful vigor, the child is fragile, reminding us of <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>, where human life is like grass that flourishes and then quickly withers.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, this cry sets the stage for a divine intervention that will display God&#8217;s power through Elisha, similar to Elijah&#8217;s raising of the widow&#8217;s son in <a href="/1_kings/17-19.htm">1 Kings 17:19-22</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he complained to his father</b><p>&#8226; The boy runs to the closest earthly protector&#8212;his father&#8212;reflecting God&#8217;s design for parental care (<a href="/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the father cannot heal him; human strength is limited (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3-4</a>). The text subtly invites readers to look past human inability to the Lord who &#8220;heals all your diseases&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a>).<p>&#8226; By stressing the father-son relationship, Scripture foreshadows the grief to come and magnifies the miracle that will follow (<a href="/john/11-4.htm">John 11:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So his father told a servant</b><p>&#8226; The father&#8217;s quick order shows both concern and practicality; he must keep the harvest moving yet respond to his son&#8217;s need.<p>&#8226; Delegating to a servant underscores social realities of agrarian Israel (<a href="/ruth/2-4.htm">Ruth 2:4</a>). More importantly, it keeps the narrative moving toward the mother, whose faith will become central (v. 22-23).<p>&#8226; Innocently, the father assumes the ailment is minor; this misreading contrasts with God&#8217;s omniscience (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Carry him to his mother.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The mother had prayed for this child (v. 16-17) and will soon act in determined faith (v. 30). Returning the boy to her reunites need with faith&#8212;a divine setup for the miracle.<p>&#8226; Mothers are often depicted as primary nurturers (<a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>). In God&#8217;s providence, the one who first believed the promise will be the one whose faith initiates restoration.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Carry him&#8221; signals urgency; similar language precedes many biblical healings (<a href="/mark/2-3.htm">Mark 2:3-5</a>). Physical transport mirrors the spiritual journey from crisis to divine encounter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Verse 19 portrays a sudden, life-threatening crisis that human resources cannot solve. The boy&#8217;s urgent cry, the father&#8217;s limited response, and the servant&#8217;s assignment all funnel the situation toward the faith-filled mother and, ultimately, toward God&#8217;s miraculous intervention through Elisha. The scene reminds us that while earthly protectors can carry us, only the Lord can cure us, and He often orchestrates events to draw faith into sharper focus before revealing His saving power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">My head, my head.</span>--The boy had a sunstroke.
