His reign is noted for his initial commitment to the LORD, which was largely influenced by the godly guidance he received. Doing "what was right in the eyes of the LORD" indicates adherence to the covenantal laws and worship practices established for Israel. This phrase is often used in the Old Testament to describe kings who followed God's commandments, contrasting with those who did evil. Joash's actions included repairing the temple, which had fallen into disrepair, signifying a return to proper worship and reverence for God.<p><b>all the days he was instructed by Jehoiada the priest</b><br>Jehoiada the priest played a crucial role in Joash's life, serving as a mentor and spiritual guide. Jehoiada's influence was instrumental in Joash's early reign, ensuring that the king's actions aligned with God's will. This highlights the importance of godly counsel and leadership in maintaining faithfulness to God. Jehoiada's role as a priest also underscores the significance of the priesthood in guiding the spiritual and moral direction of the nation. The phrase suggests that Joash's faithfulness was contingent upon Jehoiada's presence and guidance, implying a decline in Joash's adherence to God's ways after Jehoiada's death, as seen later in the narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>The king of Judah who began his reign at a young age and was guided by the priest Jehoiada.

(The accent dividing the verse ought to fall on "the Lord" rather than on "his days.") Perhaps the peculiar form of the sentence arose in this way: the writer first set down the usual statement concerning kings who supported the worship of Jehovah, and then, remembering the evils which ensued upon the death of the high priest (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-17.htm" title="Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them.">2Chronicles 24:17</a>), added as a correction of that statement, "during which Jehoiada the priest instructed him." Thenius says the words <span class= "ital">can</span> only be rendered, <span class= "ital">all his life long, because Jehoiada had instructed him</span>. They certainly <span class= "ital">can</span>, however, be rendered as our version renders them, and further, thus: "And Jehoash did . . . all his days, <span class= "ital">whom Jehoiada the priest instructed."</span> But the ambiguity of the statement gave an opportunity for discrediting the chronicler.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.</span> So the Septuagint, the Vulgate, Luther, De Wette, Keil, Bahr, and our Revisers. Only Ewald and Thenius attempt to make the passage contradict Chronicles by translating, "Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all his days, because Jehoiada the priest had instructed him." But this translation is very forced and unnatural. The writer evidently intended to add a qualifying clause to his statement that Joash reigned well "all his days," but did not wish to draw too much attention to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/12-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Joash</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1447;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3060.htm">Strong's 3060: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joash -- 'Yah is strong', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
