Historically, Moab was located east of the Dead Sea, in present-day Jordan. The Moabites were often in conflict with Israel, as seen in <a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-30</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>. This phrase sets the scene for a confrontation, highlighting the Moabites' boldness in approaching the Israelite camp, possibly underestimating Israel's strength or divine support.<p><b>the Israelites rose up and attacked them</b><br>This action reflects the Israelites' readiness and divine empowerment in battle. Rising up signifies a sudden and decisive response, often seen in biblical narratives where God empowers His people to overcome their enemies. This mirrors other instances where God commands His people to take action, such as in <a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a> with the fall of Jericho. The Israelites' attack can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to protect and give victory to His chosen people.<p><b>and they fled before them</b><br>The Moabites' retreat indicates a sudden shift in the battle's momentum, often attributed to divine intervention. This mirrors other biblical accounts where enemies flee before Israel, such as in <a href="/exodus/14-25.htm">Exodus 14:25</a> during the crossing of the Red Sea. The Moabites' flight underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and protection over Israel, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>, where God promises that enemies will flee in seven directions.<p><b>So the Israelites invaded their land</b><br>This phrase indicates a shift from defense to offense, as the Israelites move into Moabite territory. The invasion signifies a broader campaign to subdue Moab, reflecting God's judgment against them. This action is reminiscent of Israel's conquest of Canaan, where God commanded them to take possession of the land (<a href="/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3</a>). The invasion also fulfills the prophecy of Moab's defeat, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15-16</a>.<p><b>and struck down the Moabites</b><br>The phrase highlights the completeness of Israel's victory, emphasizing the Moabites' defeat. This mirrors other biblical accounts of Israel's triumphs, such as David's victories over surrounding nations (<a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>). The striking down of the Moabites can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as prophesied in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>. This victory serves as a reminder of God's justice and faithfulness to His covenant people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moabites.htm">Moabites</a></b><br>A nation descended from Moab, the son of Lot.
