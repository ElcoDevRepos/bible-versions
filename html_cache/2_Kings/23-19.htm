The reference to Bethel connects to <a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15</a>, where Josiah destroyed the altar and high place that Jeroboam had set up. This act fulfilled the prophecy given by a man of God in <a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>, which foretold that a king named Josiah would desecrate the altar. Josiah's reforms were comprehensive, targeting the root of idolatry in the land, and Bethel was a symbolic starting point due to its historical significance in Israel's apostasy.<p><b>so also in the cities of Samaria</b><br>The cities of Samaria were part of the Northern Kingdom, which had fallen to the Assyrians in 722 BC. By the time of Josiah, these areas were under Assyrian control, yet Josiah extended his reforms beyond Judah into these territories. This demonstrates his commitment to purifying all of Israel, not just his own kingdom. Samaria, as the capital of the Northern Kingdom, was a hub of idolatrous practices, and Josiah's actions here show his desire to restore true worship throughout the land.<p><b>he removed all the shrines of the high places</b><br>High places were local worship sites often associated with idolatry and syncretism. They were typically located on elevated ground and used for sacrifices and offerings to various deities. Josiah's removal of these shrines was a direct attack on the entrenched idolatrous practices that had persisted despite previous reforms. This action aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>, where God commands the destruction of such places to ensure exclusive worship of Yahweh.<p><b>set up by the kings of Israel</b><br>The kings of Israel, starting with Jeroboam I, established these high places to prevent their people from worshiping in Jerusalem. This was a political move to maintain control over the Northern Kingdom, but it led to widespread idolatry. Each successive king, with few exceptions, continued or expanded these practices, leading to the spiritual decline of Israel. Josiah's reforms sought to reverse the legacy of these kings by eradicating their religious innovations.<p><b>who had provoked the LORD to anger</b><br>The idolatry and disobedience of the kings of Israel provoked God's anger, as seen throughout the books of Kings and Chronicles. This phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where idolatry is seen as a breach of that covenant. The anger of the LORD is a recurring theme, highlighting the seriousness of Israel's apostasy and the need for repentance and reform. Josiah's actions are portrayed as a righteous response to this provocation, seeking to restore the nation's relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah known for his religious reforms and efforts to restore true worship of Yahweh.

The verse calls believers to wholehearted obedience that crosses boundaries, confronts entrenched sin, and aligns with God&#8217;s unchanging holiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">The houses also of the high places</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, temples or chapels attached to the high places.<p><span class= "bld">Josiah took away.</span>--Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/34-6.htm" title="And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even to Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.">2Chronicles 34:6</a>, from which it appears that the king's zeal carried him as far as Naphtali. The question has been asked, how it was that Josiah was able to proceed thus beyond the limits of his own territory. It is possible that, as a vassal of Assyria, he enjoyed a certain amount of authority over the old domains of the ten tribes. We have no record of either fact, but his opposition to Necho favours the idea that he recognised the Assyrian sovereign as his suzerain. Moreover, it is in itself likely that the remnant of Israel would be drawn towards Judah and its king as the surviving representatives of the past glories of their race, and would sympathise in his reformation, just as the Samaritans, in the times of the return, were eager to participate in the rebuilding of the Temple. (Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/34-9.htm" title="And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 34:9</a>.) Another supposition is that, as the fall of the Assyrian empire was imminent, no notice was taken of Josiah's proceedings in the west.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria.</span> The writer of Chronicles enters into more detail. Josiah, he says, carried out his destruction of the high places, the groves, and the images "in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali" (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a>) - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the northern limit of the Holy Land, which was occupied by Naphtali and Asher. By what right Josiah exercised sovereign authority in the old kingdom of Samaria, which the Assyrians had conquered and attached to their empire, can only be conjectured. Some have supposed that the Assyrians had enlarged his sovereignty, and placed Samaria under his rule; others regard him as having transferred his allegiance to Nabopolassar, and having been made by him viceroy over Palestine. But it is, perhaps, most probable that he merely took advantage of the political commotions of the time to extend his dominion so far as it seemed safe to do so. Asshur-bani-pal, the last energetic King of Assyria, appears to have ceased to reign in Josiah's fourteenth year, when he was succeeded by a weak monarch, Asshur-ebil-ili. Great troubles now broke out. The Scythians ravaged Western Asia far and wide. Assyria was attacked by the Medea and Babylonians in combination. Under these circumstances, Josiah found himself practically independent, and began to entertain ambitious projects. He "extended his dominion from Jerusalem over Samaria" (Ewald). Assyria was too much occupied to take any notice. Baby-Ionia was in the thick of the struggle. Josiah found himself able to reunite under his own headship all the scattered portions of the old Israelite kingdom, except, perhaps, the trans-Jordanic district. He levied taxes in Samaria as freely as in Judaea (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-9.htm">2 Chronicles 33:9</a>). He reformed on the same model the religions of both countries. When finally he had to fight for his throne, he marched his army into the northern portion of Samaria, and there fought the battle which cost him his life. <span class="cmt_word">Which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger.</span> The earlier kings of Israel had simply allowed the "high places" to continue, without actively increasing or multiplying them;
