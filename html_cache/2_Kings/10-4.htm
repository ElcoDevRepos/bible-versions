The fear expressed here is a common reaction to divine judgment and the fulfillment of prophecy. Jehu's reputation for decisive and violent action, as seen in his previous encounters, instills fear. This fear is reminiscent of the fear of God seen throughout Scripture, where individuals recognize the power and authority of God's chosen instruments. The reasoning among the people reflects a moment of clarity and acknowledgment of their precarious situation, similar to the fear and reasoning seen in the hearts of the Egyptians during the plagues (<a href="/exodus/9-20.htm">Exodus 9:20</a>).<p><b>&#8220;If two kings could not stand against him</b><br>This phrase refers to the recent deaths of King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah, both of whom were unable to withstand Jehu's assault. This highlights Jehu's effectiveness and the divine mandate behind his actions. The inability of these two kings to stand against Jehu underscores the fulfillment of Elijah's prophecy against the house of Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>). It also serves as a reminder of the futility of opposing God's will, as seen in other biblical narratives such as Pharaoh's resistance to Moses (Exodus 7-12).<p><b>how can we?&#8221;</b><br>The rhetorical question posed here reflects a sense of inevitability and submission to the unfolding events. It acknowledges the power and authority of Jehu, who acts as an instrument of God's judgment. This sentiment is echoed in other biblical accounts where individuals recognize their inability to resist God's chosen leaders, such as the Israelites' submission to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). The phrase also points to the broader theme of divine sovereignty, where human efforts are ultimately subordinate to God's plans, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The newly anointed king of Israel, tasked by God to destroy the house of Ahab and eradicate Baal worship from Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_two_kings.htm">The Two Kings</a></b><br>Refers to Joram, the king of Israel, and Ahaziah, the king of Judah, both of whom were defeated by Jehu.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, where the officials and elders were located, who were addressed in this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab's_house.htm">Ahab's House</a></b><br>The royal family and descendants of Ahab, who were under threat from Jehu's divinely appointed mission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elders_and_guardians.htm">The Elders and Guardians</a></b><br>The officials and leaders in Samaria responsible for the care of Ahab's descendants.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>Jehu's success against the two kings illustrates God's control over nations and leaders.

Up to this point, the officials of Samaria had received Jehu&#8217;s challenge to select a son of Ahab to fight for the throne (<a href="/2_kings/10-1.htm">2 Kings 10:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; The expected response might have been bold resistance. &#8220;But&#8221; tells us the opposite is about to happen, echoing turns in earlier narratives where human confidence collapses when God&#8217;s judgment moves in (cf. <a href="/exodus/14-10.htm">Exodus 14:10&#8211;12</a>; <a href="/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They were terrified</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;They&#8221; refers to the officials, elders, and guardians of Ahab&#8217;s seventy sons (<a href="/2_kings/10-1.htm">2 Kings 10:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Terror grips them because Jehu has already executed two kings&#8212;Joram of Israel and Ahaziah of Judah (<a href="/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often shows fear overtaking people when they recognize the unstoppable advance of God-appointed judgment, such as in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9&#8211;11</a> or <a href="/1_samuel/14-15.htm">1 Samuel 14:15</a>.<p>&#8226; Their fear validates God&#8217;s word spoken through Elijah that the entire house of Ahab would be wiped out (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And reasoned</b><p>&#8226; Panic does not disable their minds; it drives them to sober calculation.<p>&#8226; Reasoning together recalls <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>&#8212;&#8220;There is no wisdom, no understanding, no counsel that can prevail against the LORD&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Their discussion parallels the chief priests&#8217; whispered debate about Jesus in <a href="/luke/20-5.htm">Luke 20:5</a>, showing how human plotting recognizes when resistance is futile.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If two kings could not stand against him</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;two kings&#8221; are Joram and Ahaziah. Both fell swiftly before Jehu&#8217;s arrows (<a href="/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24, 27</a>).<p>&#8226; Kings symbolize the highest human authority. If Jehu disposed of them with ease, lesser officials have no hope.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;could not stand&#8221; echoes <a href="/2_chronicles/13-12.htm">2 Chronicles 13:12</a>&#8212;&#8220;God is with us at our head&#8230; O sons of Israel, do not fight against the LORD&#8230; for you will not succeed&#8221;. Divine backing makes Jehu&#8217;s advance irresistible.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How can we?</b><p>&#8226; Their rhetorical question ends all thoughts of defiance. It is a confession of helplessness under divine judgment, like the Ninevites in <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6&#8211;9</a>.<p>&#8226; The officials choose submission over suicide, sending word to Jehu, &#8220;We are your servants&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>).<p>&#8226; This surrender clears the way for the prophesied extinction of Ahab&#8217;s line, underscoring that God&#8217;s purposes stand when human courage fails (<a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jehu&#8217;s first letter exposes the officials&#8217; hearts. A single sharp reminder&#8212;two slain kings&#8212;overwhelms their confidence.

They could not count on the obedience even of the troops in Samaria, much less on that of any others who might be in garrison elsewhere. They would naturally have been afraid of taking up arms under almost any circumstances. What, however, caused them now such excessive fear was probably the tone which Jehu had adopted - his "scornful challenge," as it has been called. He evidently entertained no fear himself. He dared them to do that which he pretended to recommend them to do. They must have felt that he was laughing at them in his sleeve. <span class="cmt_word">And said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?</span> The kings intended are Joram and Ahaziah, who had confronted Jehu, and had met their deaths. What were they that they should succeed where "two kings" had failed? The argument was fallacious, and a mere cloak for cowardice. The two kings had been taken by surprise, and treacherously murdered. Their fate could prove nothing concerning the probable issue of a civil war, had the "princes" ventured to commence it.
