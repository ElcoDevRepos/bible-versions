The prophecy referenced here was given to Jehu in <a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>, where God promised Jehu that his descendants would sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation. This fulfillment underscores the biblical theme that God's word is reliable and will come to pass, as seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, which speaks of God's word accomplishing what He desires.<p><b>&#8220;Four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel.&#8221;</b><br>This prophecy was specifically about Jehu's dynasty, which included Jehoahaz, Jehoash, Jeroboam II, and Zechariah. Each of these kings ruled over Israel, fulfilling the promise made to Jehu. The historical context of this period was marked by political instability and idolatry in the Northern Kingdom, yet God's promise to Jehu was honored despite the nation's spiritual decline. This phrase also reflects the biblical principle of generational blessings and consequences, as seen in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5-6</a>. The mention of "four generations" can be seen as a type of God's grace, allowing a period of stability before judgment, which eventually came with the assassination of Zechariah, ending Jehu's dynasty.

There had not been wanting other indications of the coming troubles. Hosea had declared that God would avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu (<a href="/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4</a>). Amos had gone further, and had openly proclaimed that God would "rise against the house of Jeroboam <span class="accented">with the sword"</span> (<a href="/amos/7-9.htm">Amos 7:9</a>). The threat had been understood as a threat against Jeroboam himself (<a href="/amos/7-11.htm">Amos 7:11</a>), but this was a misinterpretation. The words plainly pointed, to a revolution in the time of his son. <span class="cmt_word">And so it came to pass.</span> The house of Jehu ceased to reign in the fourth generation of the descendants of its founder. No considerations of prudence or of gratitude could keep the nation faithful to any dynasty for a longer time than this. In breaking off from the divinely chosen house of David, and choosing to themselves a king, the Israelites had sown the seeds of instability in their state, and put themselves at the mercy of any ambitious pretender. Five dynasties had already borne rule in the two hundred years that the kingdom had lasted; four more were about to hold the throne in the remaining fifty years of its existence.
