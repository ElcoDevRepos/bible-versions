This anger reflects the tension between Aram (modern-day Syria) and Israel during this period. The Arameans were a constant threat to Israel, often engaging in border skirmishes and larger conflicts. The king's rage indicates the seriousness of the situation, as his plans were being consistently revealed, undermining his authority and military strategy.<p><b>and called his servants to demand of them</b><br>The king's servants would have been his trusted advisors and military officers. In ancient Near Eastern courts, such individuals were expected to be loyal and provide counsel. The king's summoning of his servants suggests a crisis of trust and a need to identify the source of the intelligence leak. This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient monarchies, where the king relied heavily on his inner circle for governance and military operations.<p><b>&#8220;Tell me, which one of us is on the side of the king of Israel?&#8221;</b><br>The king's question implies suspicion of espionage or betrayal within his ranks. This reflects the common practice of espionage in ancient warfare, where intelligence was crucial for military success. The phrase "on the side of the king of Israel" suggests a perceived internal threat, highlighting the paranoia and mistrust that can arise in times of conflict. This situation parallels other biblical narratives where internal betrayal is a theme, such as Judas' betrayal of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>). The king's inability to understand that the prophet Elisha was revealing his plans to the king of Israel underscores the spiritual dimension of the conflict, where divine intervention plays a key role, as seen throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_aram.htm">King of Aram</a></b><br>The ruler of Aram (modern-day Syria), who is frustrated by his military plans being thwarted.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_of_the_king_of_aram.htm">Servants of the King of Aram</a></b><br>The king's advisors and military officers who are questioned about the leaks of their plans.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>The prophet of Israel, who, through divine revelation, informs the king of Israel about the Aramean plans.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel</a></b><br>The ruler of Israel, who benefits from Elisha's prophetic insights.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram</a></b><br>A region and kingdom located in present-day Syria, often in conflict with Israel during this period.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_insight_and_guidance.htm">Divine Insight and Guidance</a></b><br>God provides wisdom and insight to His people, often through His chosen servants, to protect and guide them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>The plans of nations and rulers are subject to God's will.

Every ambush is foiled because, as verse 10 says, &#8220;the man of God warned the king.&#8221; The phrase reminds us:<p>&#8226; God not only sees but intervenes in real time (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-15</a>).<p>&#8226; No earthly strategy can succeed against His purpose (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>; <a href="/job/5-12.htm">Job 5:12</a>).<p>The immediate cause of the king&#8217;s fury is therefore God&#8217;s prophetic word at work through Elisha.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the king of Aram became enraged</b><p>Like Naaman earlier (<a href="/2_kings/5-11.htm">2 Kings 5:11-12</a>), the Aramean king erupts in anger when frustrated. Human rulers often respond this way when their authority is challenged (<a href="/daniel/3-19.htm">Daniel 3:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-4</a>). His rage underscores:<p>&#8226; The blindness of unbelief&#8212;he blames people, not God.<p>&#8226; The moral contrast between violent hostility and the calm assurance of those who trust the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and called his servants</b><p>Summoning his inner circle, he looks for someone to blame. Kings commonly gather advisors in crisis (<a href="/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-6.htm">1 Kings 12:6</a>), yet here the meeting is driven by suspicion, not counsel. This scene parallels Saul&#8217;s paranoid assembly in <a href="/1_samuel/22-7.htm">1 Samuel 22:7-8</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to demand of them</b><p>The verb pictures an interrogation. Power without truth resorts to coercion (<a href="/john/18-19.htm">John 18:19-23</a>). Instead of seeking divine insight, the king presses his officials, illustrating how spiritual ignorance reduces to fearful control.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Tell me&#8221;</b><p>His imperious command betrays panic. Compare Saul&#8217;s desperate &#8220;Tell me what you have done&#8221; to Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/14-43.htm">1 Samuel 14:43</a>). Such urgency exposes the insecurity of those who reject God&#8217;s sovereignty (<a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;which one of us&#8221;</b><p>The king assumes treachery inside the camp. Scripture shows this is a common misdiagnosis when God thwarts human schemes (<a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>; <a href="/john/13-21.htm">John 13:21-22</a>). He cannot imagine a supernatural explanation, so he hunts for an internal spy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;is on the side of the king of Israel?&#8221;</b><p>He believes someone is &#8220;for&#8221; Israel in a clandestine way. Ironically, the One truly for Israel is the LORD Himself (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>), working through Elisha. Verse 12 will clarify that &#8220;Elisha the prophet&#8221; hears the king&#8217;s bedroom conversations, echoing <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>&#8212;nothing is hidden from God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/6-11.htm">2 Kings 6:11</a> captures the collision between divine omniscience and human opposition. God&#8217;s revelation through Elisha frustrates Aram&#8217;s plans, kindles the king&#8217;s fury, and exposes the folly of resisting the LORD. The verse reminds us that God sees, speaks, and safeguards His people, while every scheme against His purpose ultimately collapses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Troubled.</span>--Literally, storm-tost.
