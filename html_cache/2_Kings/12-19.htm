His reign is noted for the restoration of the Temple in Jerusalem, which had fallen into disrepair. Joash's early reign was marked by his adherence to the guidance of Jehoiada the priest, which led to religious reforms. However, after Jehoiada's death, Joash's reign took a negative turn, including idolatry and the murder of Zechariah, Jehoiada's son. This phrase suggests that there were many other deeds and events during Joash's reign that are not detailed in this particular biblical account.<p><b>along with all his accomplishments</b><br>Joash's accomplishments include the significant repair and restoration of the Temple, which was a major religious and cultural center for the people of Judah. This restoration was funded by a tax levied on the people, demonstrating Joash's initial commitment to the worship of Yahweh. However, his accomplishments are overshadowed by his later failures and the moral decline of his reign, which ultimately led to his assassination by his own officials.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><br>This phrase refers to a historical record that chronicled the reigns of the kings of Judah. While this specific book is not part of the biblical canon, it is often referenced in the books of Kings and Chronicles, suggesting it was a well-known source of historical information at the time. The mention of this book indicates that the biblical account is selective and that additional details about Joash's reign could be found in this now-lost document. This phrase also highlights the practice of recording royal annals, a common practice in the ancient Near East, which served to preserve the history and legacy of a king's reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>King of Judah who reigned for 40 years.

As for the rest of the acts of Joash &#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/12-19.htm">2 Kings 12:19</a>)<p>&#8226; This opening signals that the inspired writer has given only a snapshot of Joash&#8217;s reign; there were many other events and choices that shaped his forty years on the throne (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-1.htm">2 Chronicles 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses the same lead-in when wrapping up a king&#8217;s story (<a href="/1_kings/14-19.htm">1 Kings 14:19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-15.htm">2 Kings 14:15</a>), reminding us that God selectively records what He knows we need for faith and obedience (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226; Joash&#8217;s &#8220;rest of the acts&#8221; include both bright moments&#8212;his covenant renewal under Jehoiada and the major temple renovation (<a href="/2_kings/12-4.htm">2 Kings 12:4-16</a>)&#8212;and dark ones&#8212;his slide into idolatry and the murder of Jehoiada&#8217;s son when godly counsel was gone (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17-22</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse quietly invites us to look beyond isolated highlights and ask how a lifetime of choices adds up before the Lord (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with all his accomplishments,</b><p>&#8220; &#8230;along with all his accomplishments &#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/12-19.htm">2 Kings 12:19</a> b)<p>&#8226; The Hebrew word behind &#8220;accomplishments&#8221; embraces deeds, achievements, and exploits. For Joash these include:<p>&#8211; Physical: the costly, careful repair of Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/2_kings/12-10.htm">2 Kings 12:10-14</a>).<p>&#8211; Military: buying off Aramean pressure by sending Hazael the temple treasures (<a href="/2_kings/12-17.htm">2 Kings 12:17-18</a>).<p>&#8211; Administrative: reorganizing priestly oversight of offerings (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-5.htm">2 Chronicles 24:5-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet <a href="/bsb/2_chronicles/24.htm">2 Chronicles 24</a> shows that true accomplishment hinges on sustained faithfulness, not early success. After Jehoiada&#8217;s death, Joash abandoned the LORD, and judgment followed (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; A king&#8217;s r&#233;sum&#233; impresses only when anchored in obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>; <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>). Joash started well but finished poorly, warning us that spiritual diligence must be lifelong (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><p>&#8220; &#8230;are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? &#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/12-19.htm">2 Kings 12:19</a> c)<p>&#8226; This recurring phrase (<a href="/1_kings/15-7.htm">1 Kings 15:7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-17.htm">2 Kings 21:17</a>) states that fuller court records once existed&#8212;official archives detailing each reign.<p>&#8226; While those annals are lost to history, their mention underscores:<p>&#8211; The historical reliability of Kings. Contemporary sources backed every inspired account (<a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1-4</a>).<p>&#8211; The sufficiency of Scripture. God has preserved exactly what He intends us to know; we are not lacking vital truth (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>).<p>&#8211; The accountability of leaders. Earthly records might vanish, but heaven keeps perfect books (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).<p>&#8226; We may be curious about political treaties or architectural specifics, yet the Holy Spirit zeroes in on the spiritual storyline&#8212;the king&#8217;s covenant faithfulness or failure (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-72</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/12-19.htm">2 Kings 12:19</a> is the inspired footnote to Joash&#8217;s biography. It tells us that the narrative we have is selective, that Joash achieved much more than the chapter records, and that exhaustive details were once available in royal archives now lost. The verse affirms Scripture&#8217;s historical precision while stressing that God&#8217;s Word highlights what matters eternally: enduring faithfulness. Joash&#8217;s life reminds us to finish as well as we begin, because in the final ledger only deeds done in steadfast obedience will stand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-21.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">close of the reign of Joash - his murder by his servants</span>. Again the narrative of Kings is to be supplemented by that of Chronicles. From Chronicles we learn that, before the withdrawal of the Syrians, Joash had fallen into a severe illness, which confined him to his apartment (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>). This gave opportunity for conspiracy. Among the courtiers were two, perhaps more, whom the fate of Zechariah had grieved, and who were probably opposed to the entire series of later changes in religion which had been sanctioned by Joash (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17, 18</a>). These persons "made a conspiracy," which was successful, and "slew Joash on his bed" (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>). They then buried him in Jerusalem, but "not in the sepulchers of the kings." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> This formal phrase, with which he concludes his account of almost every Jewish king (<a href="/1_kings/14-29.htm">1 Kings 14:29</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-7.htm">1 Kings 15:7, 23</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-45.htm">1 Kings 22:45</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-23.htm">2 Kings 8:23</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-18.htm">2 Kings 14:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-6.htm">2 Kings 15:6</a>, etc.), cannot be regarded as an acknowledgment by the author of any special or designed reticence with respect to the reign of Joash. We must suppose him unconscious of any such design. He had to omit much in every case; in the present he happened to omit all the darker shades; and the result was an over-favorable portraiture of the monarch. But, in the providence of God, complete historical justice was secured by the labors and researches of a second inspired writer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/12-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for the rest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1435;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ye&#183;&#7791;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
