It reflects the Assyrian strategy of psychological warfare, aiming to undermine the confidence of the Israelites in their God. Historically, the Assyrian Empire was a dominant military power, known for its conquests and the subjugation of many nations. The Assyrians had a reputation for brutality and effectiveness in warfare, which made their threats particularly intimidating.<p><b>the god of any nation</b><br>In the ancient Near East, each nation was believed to have its own patron deity. The Assyrians, who worshipped gods like Ashur and Ishtar, often attributed their military successes to the favor of their deities. This phrase challenges the power of these local gods, suggesting that none had been able to withstand Assyria's might. Theologically, this sets the stage for a demonstration of the God of Israel's supremacy over other deities, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>ever delivered his land</b><br>The phrase implies a historical precedent, suggesting that no other god has successfully protected their nation from Assyrian conquest. This is a direct challenge to the faith of the Israelites, who believed in Yahweh's power to deliver them. The Assyrians had indeed conquered many lands, including the northern kingdom of Israel, which fell in 722 BC. This historical context adds weight to the Assyrian claim, as they had a track record of victories.<p><b>from the hand of the king of Assyria?</b><br>The "hand" symbolizes power and control, a common biblical metaphor for dominion. The king of Assyria at this time was Sennacherib, known for his military campaigns and expansion of the empire. His reign is well-documented in Assyrian records, including the famous Taylor Prism, which details his conquests. The Assyrian kings were seen as instruments of their gods' will, and their victories were often interpreted as divine favor. This phrase challenges the Israelites to consider whether their God can truly protect them against such a formidable foe.<br><br>In the broader biblical narrative, this challenge sets the stage for God's miraculous deliverance of Jerusalem, as recorded later in <a href="/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19</a>. It highlights the theme of God's sovereignty and power over all nations and their gods, foreshadowing the ultimate victory of Christ over all spiritual powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to reform the religious practices of his people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The king of Assyria, who invaded Judah and laid siege to Jerusalem, challenging the power of the God of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A dominant empire during this period, known for its military might and conquests, including the siege of Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, under threat from the Assyrian army, and the focal point of Hezekiah's faith and leadership.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabshakeh.htm">Rabshakeh</a></b><br>The Assyrian field commander who delivered the message of intimidation to the people of Jerusalem, questioning the power of their God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite the intimidating threats from powerful adversaries, believers are called to trust in God's ultimate authority and power over all nations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>The rhetorical question posed by the Assyrian commander highlights the impotence of false gods, contrasting with the living God who actively intervenes in history.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Hezekiah's response to the Assyrian threat demonstrates the importance of seeking God's guidance and intervention through prayer and reliance on His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>The historical context of God's past deliverances serves as a reminder of His unchanging nature and faithfulness to His covenant people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The spiritual battle faced by Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem mirrors the ongoing spiritual warfare believers encounter, emphasizing the need for spiritual vigilance and reliance on God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_18_33_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 18:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_18_33_Trust_in_God_today.htm">How does 2 Kings 18:33 challenge our trust in God's deliverance today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_18_33_God_s_sovereignty_context.htm">What historical context in 2 Kings 18:33 enhances our understanding of God's sovereignty?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_2_Kings_18_33_to_today_s_issues.htm">How can we apply the lessons from 2 Kings 18:33 to modern challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Biblical_examples_of_God_s_deliverance_2.htm">What other biblical examples show God's deliverance against seemingly insurmountable odds?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_18_33_Faith_vs_Doubts.htm">How does 2 Kings 18:33 encourage steadfast faith amidst external pressures and doubts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Did_other_gods_save_nations_from_Assyria.htm">Did the gods of other nations ever deliver them from the king of Assyria in 2 Kings 18:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_18_33_vs_other_gods_power.htm">How does 2 Kings 18:33 challenge the belief in the power of other gods?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_2_Kings_18_33_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in 2 Kings 18:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_kings_18.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Kings 18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_do_2_chron._32_and_2_kings_18-19_differ.htm">Why does 2 Chronicles 32 seem to present a different order of events compared to 2 Kings 18-19 regarding the siege and Hezekiah's actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_did_rabshakeh_speak_hebrew.htm">2 Kings 18:17 &#8211; Why would Rabshakeh speak in Hebrew if he didn&#8217;t want Judah&#8217;s people to hear his threats?

Rabshakeh speaks as though gods are mere tribal mascots. Scripture, however, insists there is one true God:<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> &#8211; &#8220;Who is like You, O LORD, among the gods?&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-35.htm">Deuteronomy 4:35</a> &#8211; &#8220;The LORD, He is God; there is no other besides Him.&#8221;<p>The taunt is meant to undermine Judah&#8217;s faith, but it actually highlights the difference between lifeless idols and the living LORD (<a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of any nation</b><p>By adding &#8220;of any nation,&#8221; Rabshakeh claims universal success: Assyria&#8217;s conquests prove no nation&#8217;s deity can resist. Compare his boast in <a href="/2_chronicles/32-13.htm">2 Chronicles 32:13-14</a>: none of the &#8220;gods of the nations&#8221; were able to save. Yet God had already shown His supremacy over every land (<a href="/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/5-4.htm">1 Samuel 5:4</a>). The phrase exposes Assyria&#8217;s arrogance against all peoples and, ultimately, against God Himself (<a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>ever delivered</b><p>&#8220;Ever delivered&#8221; questions whether divine rescue has ever happened.

Yet the earth belongs to the LORD (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>). For Israel, the land was covenant gift (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>). By mocking &#8220;his land,&#8221; the envoy dismisses both covenant and Creator, forgetting that Yahweh rules beyond borders (<a href="/jeremiah/23-23.htm">Jeremiah 23:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the hand</b><p>&#8220;Hand&#8221; signifies power.

The contest is really between human strength and divine sovereignty.

Within a day, 185,000 troops lie dead, and the proud king retreats (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35-36</a>).

Idols tied to territories fail, but the LORD reigns over all nations, delivers His people, and overthrows the proud. The question &#8220;Has the god of any nation ever delivered&#8230;?&#8221; is answered decisively in the next chapter: yes&#8212;the God of Israel, unrivaled and eternal, delivers His land and His people by His mighty hand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">Hath any . . . his land.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">have the</span> <span class= "ital">gods of the nations at all delivered every one his own</span> <span class= "ital">Land?</span> If this is to be consistent with <a href="/2_kings/18-25.htm" title="Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it?

But, as <a href="/context/2_kings/18-34.htm" title="Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?">2Kings 18:34-35</a> seem to imply the impotence of the foreign deities when opposed to the might of Assyria, a verbal inconsistency may be admitted. (See Note on <a href="/2_chronicles/32-15.htm" title="Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?">2Chronicles 32:15</a>.)<p>The <span class= "ital">rab-sak</span> would hardly be very particular about what he said in an extemporised address, the sole aim of which was to work on the fears of the Jews.

It had all the force of what appeared to them a complete induction. As far back as they could remember, they had always been contending with different tribes and nations, each and all of whom had had gods in whom they trusted, and the result had been uniform - the gods had been unequal to the task of protecting their votaries against Assyria: how could it be imagined that Jehovah would prove an exception? If he was not exactly, as Knobel calls him, "the insignificant god of an insignificant people," yet how was he better or stronger than the others - than Chemosh, or Moloch, or Rim-moll, or Baal, or Ashima, or Khaldi, or Bel, or Merodach? What had he done for the Jews hitherto? Nothing remarkable, so far as the Assyrians knew; for their memories did not reach back so far as the time of Asa and the deliverance from Zerah, much less to the conquest of Canaan or the Exodus. He had not 'saved the trans-Jordanic tribes from Tiglath-pileser, or Samaria from his successors. Was it not madness to suppose that he would save Judaea from Sennacherib? A heathen reasoner could not see, could not be expected to see, the momentous difference; that the gods of the other countries were "no gods" (<a href="/2_kings/19-18.htm">2 Kings 19:18</a>), while Jehovah was "the Lord of the whole earth." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/18-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Has the god</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of any</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">nation</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;&#1460;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#333;&#183;w&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
