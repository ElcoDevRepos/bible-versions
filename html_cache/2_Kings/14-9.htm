The division followed the reign of Solomon and resulted in two separate kingdoms often at odds. Jehoash's response is part of a larger narrative of conflict between these two kingdoms. Historically, this reflects the ongoing tension and rivalry between Israel and Judah, which often led to military confrontations.<p><b>A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon:</b><br>The imagery of a thistle and a cedar is symbolic. The thistle represents something small and insignificant, while the cedar, known for its strength and grandeur, symbolizes something mighty and majestic. Lebanon was famous for its cedars, which were highly valued for construction, including the temple built by Solomon. This metaphor highlights the disparity between Amaziah's ambition and his actual power, suggesting that Amaziah's challenge to Jehoash was presumptuous.<p><b>Saying, &#8216;Give your daughter to my son in marriage.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase suggests a proposal of alliance or equality, as marriages in ancient times were often used to secure political alliances. However, the metaphorical nature of the statement implies that Amaziah's request is overreaching, as a thistle has no business proposing marriage to a cedar. This reflects the cultural practice of using marriage as a means of forming alliances, but also underscores the arrogance perceived in Amaziah's actions.<p><b>Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle:</b><br>The wild beast represents an unforeseen and overpowering force that destroys the thistle, symbolizing Amaziah's impending defeat. This imagery suggests the futility of Amaziah's challenge against Jehoash, as the natural order and strength of the wild beast easily overcome the fragile thistle. The use of a wild beast also conveys the idea of divine judgment or intervention, as God often used natural imagery to communicate His sovereignty and power over human affairs. This can be seen as a warning against pride and overconfidence, themes prevalent throughout scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoash.htm">Jehoash (Joash) King of Israel</a></b><br>The king of the northern kingdom of Israel, who reigned during a time of conflict with Judah.

And the thistle sent to the cypress, saying,' Contract thy daughter in marriage to my son.' And while this was transacting, a wild beast passed by and trod down the thistle. Let this be a warning to thee not to cherish immoderate desires, and not, because thou hast had success against Amalek, to pride thyself thereupon, and so draw down dangers both upon thee and upon thy kingdom." The force of the original message is much weakened in this paraphrase. <span class="cmt_word">The thistle that was in Lebanon.</span> "Thistle" is a better translation than "thorn-bush" (Keil), first, as a meaner, growth, and secondly, as more likely to be trodden down by a wild beast. The monarch intends to say that the meanest thing in the vegetable world sent to the grandest, claiming equality. <span class="cmt_word">Sent to the cedar</span> - certainly "the cedar." and not "the cypress," as translated by Josephus - <span class="cmt_word">that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife.</span> <span class="accented">Nube pari</span> was a Roman maxim; and the rule was one generally established throughout the ancient world.
