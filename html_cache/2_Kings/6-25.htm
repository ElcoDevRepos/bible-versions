Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, was strategically significant and often targeted by enemies. Famines were seen as divine judgment in the biblical narrative, often linked to the people's disobedience to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-52.htm">Deuteronomy 28:52-53</a>). This famine underscores the severity of the siege and the desperation of the people.<p><b>Indeed, they besieged the city so long</b><br>The prolonged siege indicates the determination of the Arameans to conquer Samaria. Historically, sieges could last months or even years, leading to dire conditions within the city walls. The endurance of the siege reflects the political and military tensions between Israel and Aram (modern-day Syria), a recurring theme in the books of Kings.<p><b>that a donkey&#8217;s head sold for eighty shekels of silver,</b><br>The mention of a donkey's head, an unclean animal according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/11-3.htm">Leviticus 11:3-8</a>), highlights the extreme scarcity of food. The exorbitant price of eighty shekels of silver, a significant sum, illustrates the desperation and inflation caused by the siege. This situation is reminiscent of other biblical accounts of famine, such as the one in <a href="/2_kings/7.htm">2 Kings 7:1-2</a>, where Elisha prophesies relief from famine.<p><b>and a quarter cab of dove&#8217;s dung sold for five shekels of silver.</b><br>Dove's dung, possibly a term for a type of seed or a literal reference to bird droppings, was sold at a high price, indicating the severe lack of food. The use of such items for sustenance reflects the dire conditions and the lengths to which people would go to survive. This phrase emphasizes the desperation and degradation experienced during the siege, serving as a backdrop for the miraculous deliverance that follows in the narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital city of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which was under siege by the Arameans, leading to a severe famine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/arameans.htm">Arameans</a></b><br>The enemy nation besieging Samaria, causing the famine and desperation within the city.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>A severe lack of food resulting from the siege, leading to extreme measures for survival.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/donkey's_head.htm">Donkey&#8217;s Head</a></b><br>Considered an unclean animal in Jewish law, yet sold at a high price due to the famine, indicating the desperation of the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/dove's_dung.htm">Dove&#8217;s Dung</a></b><br>Possibly a term for a type of seed or a literal reference, sold at a high price, further illustrating the dire conditions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The famine in Samaria serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.

Ass's flesh would not ordinarily be eaten at all, and the head of any animal would be the cheapest part. Plutarch mentions that during a famine among the Cadusians an ass's head could hardly be got for sixty drachms (about 2. 10s.), though ordinarily the entire animal could be bought for about half that sum. And Pliny relates that when Hannibal was besieging Casalinum, a mouse was sold for 200 denarii (6 5s.).<p><span class= "bld">The fourth part of a cab of dove's dung</span>.--The <span class= "ital">cab</span> was the smallest Hebrew dry measure.

The term <span class= "ital">dove's dung</span>, in all probability, denotes some kind of common <span class= "ital">vegetable</span> produce, perhaps a sort of pulse or pease, which was ordinarily very cheap. Such a designation is not unparalleled. The Arabs call the herb <span class= "ital">kali</span> "sparrow's dung;" and <span class= "ital">Assaf?tida</span> is in German "devil's dung." In some places in England a species of wild hyacinth is called "dead man's hands," from the livid markings on the flower. The shape and colour of the species of pulse mentioned in the text may similarly account for its name. It naturally occurs that so long as there were any "doves" left in the city it would not be necessary to eat their <span class= "ital">dung</span>. When Josephus wrote that dung was eaten in the siege of Jerusalem, he probably had the present passage in his mind.<p><span class= "bld">Five pieces of silver.</span>--<span class= "ital">Five</span> (shekels in) <span class= "ital">silver</span>; about 12s. 6d.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was a great famine in Samaria.</span> It was Benhadad's design to capture the place, not by battering down its walls with military engines, but by blockading it, and cutting off all its supplies, as Josephus tells us (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.</span> The ass, being an unclean animal (<a href="/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4</a>), would not be eaten at all except in the last extremity, and the head was the worst and so the cheapest part; yet it sold for "eighty pieces" (rather, shekels) of silver, or about &pound;5 of our money; as in the Cadusian famine mentioned by Plutarch ('Wit. Artaxerx.,' &sect; 24), where an ass's head was sold for sixty drachmas (about forty shillings). "Dove's dung" is thought by some to be the name of a plant; but it is better to understand the term literally. Both animal and human excrement have been eaten in sieges (Josephus, ' Bell. Jud.,' 5:13. &sect; 7; Cels., 'Hierobot.,' 2. p. 233), when a city was in the last extremity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/6-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So there was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
