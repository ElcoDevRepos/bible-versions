The timing suggests a new beginning or a fresh start, often seen in biblical narratives as a moment of divine action or revelation.<p><b>at the time of the morning sacrifice</b><br>The morning sacrifice was a daily ritual in ancient Israel, typically involving the offering of a lamb at the temple in Jerusalem. This practice was a central part of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. The timing of the miracle at this moment underscores the connection between divine intervention and the faithfulness of worship practices.<p><b>water suddenly flowed</b><br>The sudden appearance of water is a miraculous event, emphasizing God's power to provide in unexpected ways. This miracle is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God provides water, such as Moses striking the rock in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>). It highlights God's ability to meet the needs of His people in dire circumstances.<p><b>from the direction of Edom</b><br>Edom, located to the southeast of Israel, was often in conflict with Israel but also had periods of alliance, as seen in this chapter. The geographical reference indicates the source of the water, which would have been unexpected given the arid conditions. This direction also signifies God's control over all lands, even those of traditional enemies.<p><b>and filled the land</b><br>The abundance of water not only met the immediate needs of the armies but also symbolized God's provision and blessing. This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers living water to all who believe (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>).

The verse reassures believers that God keeps His word, meets needs abundantly, and aligns His help with hearts set on worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(</span>20<span class= "ital">)</span> <span class= "bld">When the meat offering was offered.</span>--Comp. <a href="/1_kings/18-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.">1Kings 18:29</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm" title="And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.">1Kings 18:36</a>. A more exact definition of the time. The reckoning by <span class= "ital">hours</span> was unknown before the captivity. According to the Talmud, the morning sacrifice was offered in the Temple the moment it became light. (Ewald assumes that "the meat offering" was offered on this occasion in the camp.) That help came to the distressed army just at the hour of morning worship was a striking coincidence. (This allusion to the law of <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm" title="Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.">Exodus 29:38</a>, <span class= "ital">seq</span>., may be an <span class= "ital">indirect</span> hit at the northern kingdom.)<p><span class= "bld">There came water.</span>--<span class= "ital">Water was coming from the way</span> (direction) <span class= "ital">of Edom</span>. It would seem that a sudden storm of rain had fallen on the mountains of Seir, at some distance from the camp (Josephus says at a distance of three days' march); and the water found its natural outlet in the dry wady. Reuss thinks this explanation "superfluous," in the face of "the author's intention to describe a <span class= "ital">miracle</span>;" but there are different kinds of miracle, and, in the present instance, the miraculous element is visible in the prophet's prediction of the coming help, and in the <span class= "ital">coincidence</span> of the natural phenomena with the needs of the Israelites. (Comp. <a href="/context/2_kings/7-1.htm" title="Then Elisha said, Hear you the word of the LORD; Thus said the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.">2Kings 7:1-2</a>, <span class= "ital">seq</span>.)

The nocturnal storm had burst, not in the Moabite country, where it would have attracted the attention of the Moabites, but in some comparatively distant part of the Idumaean territory, so that the Moabites were not aware of it. Josephus says that the storm burst at a distance of three days' journey from the Israelite camp ('Ant.
