His reign marked the height of Babylonian power, and he is known for his military conquests and the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. His actions fulfilled the prophecies of Jeremiah and other prophets who warned of Babylonian dominance as a consequence of Judah's disobedience to God.<p><b>made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin&#8217;s uncle, king in his place</b><br>Mattaniah was the son of Josiah and the brother of Jehoiakim, making him the uncle of Jehoiachin. By appointing Mattaniah, Nebuchadnezzar was exercising control over Judah, ensuring that the king would be loyal to Babylon. This was a common practice for empires to install puppet rulers to maintain influence over conquered territories. The change in leadership was a direct result of Jehoiachin's rebellion against Babylon, which led to his exile.<p><b>and changed his name to Zedekiah</b><br>The renaming of Mattaniah to Zedekiah signifies Nebuchadnezzar's authority over him. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, changing a person's name often symbolized a change in status or allegiance. The name Zedekiah means "The Lord is my righteousness," which is ironic given Zedekiah's eventual rebellion against Babylon and failure to uphold God's covenant. This act of renaming also reflects the broader biblical theme of God changing names to signify a new identity or mission, as seen with Abram to Abraham and Jacob to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_babylon.htm">King of Babylon</a></b><br>Refers to Nebuchadnezzar II, the powerful ruler of the Babylonian Empire, who exerted control over Judah during this period.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mattaniah.htm">Mattaniah</a></b><br>The son of Josiah and uncle to Jehoiachin, who was appointed king by Nebuchadnezzar and renamed Zedekiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiachin.htm">Jehoiachin</a></b><br>The previous king of Judah, who was taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar, leading to the appointment of Zedekiah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The new name given to Mattaniah by Nebuchadnezzar, signifying his subjugation and the Babylonian influence over Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was under Babylonian control during this time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_leadership_changes.htm">God's Sovereignty in Leadership Changes</a></b><br>Even when political changes seem driven by human ambition, God remains sovereign.

Nebuchadnezzar found a son of Josiah, named Mattaniah, still surviving at Jerusalem. At his father's death he must have been a boy of ten, but he was now, eleven years later, of the age of twenty-one. This youth, only three years older than his nephew Jehoiachin, he appointed king, at the same time requiring him to change his name, which he did from "Mattaniah" to "Zedekiah" (ver. 17). Zedekiah pursued nearly the same course of action as the other recent kings. He showed no religious zeal, instituted no reform, but allowed the idolatrous practices, to which the people were so addicted, to continue (ver. 19). Though less irreligious and less inclined to persecute than Jehoiakim, he could not bring himself to turn to God. He was weak and vacillating, inclined to follow the counsels of Jeremiah, but afraid of the "princes," and ultimately took their advice, which was to ally himself with Egypt, and openly rebel against Nebuchadnezzar. This course of conduct brought about the destruction of the nation (ver. 29). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead.</span> Josiah had four sons (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>) - Johanan, the eldest, who probably died before his father; Jehoiakim, or Eliakim, the second, who was twenty-five years old at his father's death (<a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>); Jehoahaz, the third, otherwise called Shallum (1 Chronicles, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a>), who, when his father died, was aged twenty-three (2 Kings 32:31); and Mattaniah, the youngest, who must have been then aged ten or nine. It was this fourth son, now grown to manhood, whom Nebuchadnezzar appointed king in Jehoiachin's room. <span class="cmt_word">And changed his name to Zedekiah.</span> (On the practice of changing a king's name on his accession, see the comment upon <a href="/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31, 34</a>.) Mat-lab means "Gift of Jehovah;" Zedekiah, "Righteousness of Jehovah." Josiah had called his son the first of these names in humble acknowledgment of God's mercy in granting him a fourth son. So other pious Jews called their sons "Nathaniel," and Greeks "Theodotus" or "Theodorus," and Romans "Deodatua." Mattaniah, in taking the second of the names, may have had in his mind the prophecy of <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-8</a>, where blessings are promised to the reign of a king whose name should be "<span class="accented">Jehovah-Tsidkenu</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "The Lord our Righteousness." Or he may simply have intended to declare that "the righteousness of Jehovah" was what he aimed at establishing. In this case it can only be said that it would have been happy for his country, had his professions been corroborated by his acts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/24-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Babylon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1462;&#1435;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#7687;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_894.htm">Strong's 894: </a> </span><span class="str2">Babylon -- an eastern Mediterranean empire and its capital city</span><br /><br /><span class="word">made Mattaniah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(mat&#183;tan&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4983.htm">Strong's 4983: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mattaniah -- 'gift of Yah', the last king of Judah, also a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jehoiachin's] uncle,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1465;&#1491;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#333;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
