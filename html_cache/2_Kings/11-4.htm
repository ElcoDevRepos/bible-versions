In this context, it refers to the seventh year of Athaliah's reign, a time when Jehoiada, the high priest, saw the opportunity to act against her usurpation of the throne. The number seven frequently symbolizes divine perfection or completion in Scripture, as seen in the creation week (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>).<p><b>Jehoiada sent for the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, and the guards</b><br>Jehoiada, the high priest, was a key figure in preserving the Davidic line. The "commanders of hundreds" were military leaders, indicating a well-organized plan. The Carites were likely mercenaries or a special guard unit, possibly of foreign origin, similar to the Cherethites and Pelethites who served King David (<a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>). The guards were temple guards, responsible for the security of the sacred precincts. This assembly of military and temple personnel underscores the strategic and sacred nature of Jehoiada's plan.<p><b>and had them brought into the house of the LORD</b><br>The house of the LORD, or the temple, was the central place of worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people. By bringing the commanders and guards into the temple, Jehoiada was not only ensuring secrecy but also invoking the authority and sanctity of God in his actions. The temple served as a place of refuge and divine endorsement for the covenant to be made.<p><b>There he made a covenant with them and put them under oath</b><br>Covenants in the Bible are solemn agreements often made before God, signifying a binding commitment. Jehoiada's covenant with the commanders and guards was a pledge to protect the rightful heir to the throne and to overthrow Athaliah. Oaths were taken seriously in ancient Israel, as breaking them was seen as an offense against God (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). This covenant echoes the Davidic Covenant, which promised the continuation of David's line (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>He showed them the king&#8217;s son</b><br>The king's son, Joash, was the rightful heir to the throne, hidden for six years to protect him from Athaliah's murderous intent. Revealing Joash was a pivotal moment, as it confirmed the legitimacy of Jehoiada's plan and rallied support for the restoration of the Davidic line. This act prefigures the revelation of Jesus Christ, the ultimate King from David's line, who was also hidden from the world until the appointed time (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada.htm">Jehoiada</a></b><br>A high priest who played a crucial role in preserving the Davidic line by protecting Joash and orchestrating his coronation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/commanders_of_hundreds.htm">Commanders of Hundreds</a></b><br>Military leaders who were entrusted with the task of protecting the young king and ensuring the success of Jehoiada's plan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/carites.htm">Carites</a></b><br>A group of mercenaries or royal guards, possibly of foreign origin, who were loyal to Jehoiada and played a role in the protection of Joash.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/guards.htm">Guards</a></b><br>The temple guards who were responsible for the security of the temple and the safety of the king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_the_lord.htm">House of the LORD</a></b><br>The temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and the setting for the covenant and the revelation of the king's son.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_godly_leadership.htm">The Importance of Godly Leadership</a></b><br>Jehoiada's leadership was instrumental in preserving the Davidic line and ensuring the continuation of God's promises.

The curious fact that his rank is not specified hero upon the <span class= "ital">first</span> mention of his name, suggests the inference that in the original authority of this narrative he had been mentioned as high priest, and husband of Jehosheba, at the outset of the story, as in <a href="/2_chronicles/22-11.htm" title="But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber.

Notes on <a href="/1_kings/1-38.htm" title="So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.">1Kings 1:38</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.">2Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-18.htm" title="And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.">2Samuel 15:18</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-6.htm" title="And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.">2Samuel 16:6</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-17.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.">1Chronicles 18:17</a>.) Thenius argues against the idea that so patriotic and pious a king as David could have employed foreign and heathen soldiers as his body-guard. But did not David himself serve as a mercenary with Achish, king of Gath, and commit his parents to the care of the king of Moab? And would not the mercenaries who enlisted in the guard of the Israelite sovereigns adopt the religion of their new country? (Comp. the case of Uriah <span class= "ital">the Hittite</span>.) The apparently <span class= "ital">gentilic</span> ending of the words rendered "Cherethites and Pelethites" in Samuel, and that rendered "captains" in this place, Thenius explains as marking an adjective denoting <span class= "ital">position </span>or<span class= "ital"> class</span>. It may be so, but <span class= "ital">sub judice lis est</span>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-16.</span> - <span class="accented">Conspiracy of Jehoiada</span>. After waiting, impatiently we may be sure, for six long years, and seeing the young prince grow from an infant to a boy of seven years of age, Jehoiada deemed that the time was come to venture on an effort. It was necessary for him to make his arrangements beforehand with great care. His first step was to sound the captains of the royal guard. To these men, five in number (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>), he sent secretly, and in-wired them to confer with him in the temple on important business. Finding them well disposed to adopt his views, he revealed to them the fact that Joash had escaped the massacre of Ahaziah's sons, and was still living, even allowing them to see him. The result of the interview was that they put themselves at Jehoiada's disposal, and agreed to take their orders from him (ver. 4). Jehoiada then proceeded to his second step. Either distrusting the body-guard which the captains commanded, or regarding it as insufficient in numbers, he gave them orders to visit the various cities of Judea, and collect from them a strong force of Levites and other trusty persons, and bring them to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>), where he would give them their orders. This was done successfully, and, as it would seem, without in any way rousing the suspicions of Athaliah. A day was fixed for proclaiming Joash king; the guard and the Levites were skillfully disposed about the temple and the palace; the king was brought up, crowned, anointed, and saluted as monarch, with noisy acclamations (ver. 12). The noise was heard in the palace, and Athaliah went forth, with a few attendants, to inquire the reason of it. Following the sound, she came to the temple, and entered it, when she saw what was going on, and cried out, "Treason! Treason!" By Jehoiada's order the guards seized her, conducted her out of the temple, and slew her (vers. 13-16). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the seventh year</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and in the seventh year</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the course of it - <span class="cmt_word">Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds,</span> <span class="cmt_word">with the captains and the guard</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the captains over hundreds</span> (or, centurions) <span class="accented">of the Carites and the guard</span> (see the Revised Version). The "Carites," here first named, are generally regarded as identical with the Cherethites of earlier times (<a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>). They were undoubtedly a particular portion of the royal guard, and may, perhaps, as many suppose, have been "Caftan" mercenaries, though we have no other evidence that the Carians had adopted the mercenary life so early as the time of Athaliah. Still, as their devotion to it had passed into a proverb when Archilochus wrote (B.C. 700-660), it is quite possible that they had begun the practice a century or two earlier. When Jehoiada is said to have "sent and fetched" the centurions, we must understand that he secretly invited them, and that they consented to come. He could not possibly have any authority over them, so as to require their attendance. The names of the five centurions, together with their fathers' names, were put on record by the writer of Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>), whose account of the revolution is in many respects fuller than that in Kings. <span class="cmt_word">And brought them to him into the house of the Lord</span> - as the safest place for an interview which had to be kept secret from the queen - <span class="cmt_word">and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the Lord.</span> We can easily understand that the soldiers, who had been willing to serve Athaliah under the notion that the house of David was extinct, might waver in their allegiance so soon as they heard that a scion of the old royal stock survived, and could be produced at a moment's notice. Their traditions would attach them to David and his seed, not to the house of Ahab. <span class="cmt_word">And showed them the king's son.</span> Having bound the centurions by a solemn covenant to the cause of the young king, Jehoiada introduced them into his presence.
