His prayers often resulted in miraculous events, demonstrating his close relationship with God. This phrase highlights the importance of prayer as a means of divine intervention and guidance. Elisha's reliance on prayer is a model for believers, emphasizing the power of intercession.<p><b>&#8220;O LORD, please open his eyes that he may see.&#8221;</b><br>Elisha's request for the young man's eyes to be opened is both literal and spiritual. In the biblical context, seeing often symbolizes understanding or perceiving spiritual truths. This prayer reflects the need for spiritual insight to recognize God's presence and protection. It parallels other biblical instances where God opens eyes, such as in <a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>, where the psalmist asks for understanding of God's law.<p><b>And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man,</b><br>This divine action signifies God's response to prayer and His willingness to reveal spiritual realities to those who seek Him. The opening of the young man's eyes is a supernatural event, illustrating God's power to transcend human limitations. It serves as a reminder that spiritual insight is a gift from God, not achieved through human effort alone.<p><b>and he saw that the hills were full of horses and chariots of fire</b><br>The imagery of horses and chariots of fire is reminiscent of the divine chariot that took Elijah to heaven (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>). This vision represents God's heavenly army, symbolizing His protection and sovereignty. The presence of these fiery chariots underscores the theme of divine warfare, where God fights on behalf of His people, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>, which speaks of the angel of the LORD encamping around those who fear Him.<p><b>all around Elisha.</b><br>The protection surrounding Elisha signifies God's favor and the special role of prophets as His messengers. This scene reassures believers of God's omnipresence and His ability to protect His servants. It also foreshadows the New Testament promise of spiritual protection for believers, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>, which declares that if God is for us, who can be against us?<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God, successor to Elijah, known for his miracles and deep faith in God.

And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.">2Kings 2:12</a>), so now a similar appearance surrounds and protects the latter. "It is a fine thought," says Thenius, "that on this occasion the veil of earthly existence was lifted for a moment for one child of man, so as to allow him a clear glimpse of the sovereignty of Providence."
