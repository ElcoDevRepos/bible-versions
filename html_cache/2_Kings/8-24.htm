The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a joining with ancestors in the afterlife. Jehoram's reign was marked by idolatry and evil practices, as he followed the ways of the kings of Israel rather than the righteous path of his forefathers. His death signifies the end of a turbulent period in Judah's history, characterized by alliances with the northern kingdom of Israel and the introduction of Baal worship.<p><b>and was buried with them in the City of David.</b><br>The City of David refers to Jerusalem, specifically the area that was the original stronghold captured by King David. Being buried in the City of David was an honor, reserved for the kings of Judah, signifying a continuation of the Davidic line despite Jehoram's unfaithfulness. This burial location underscores the importance of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Judah. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of royal tombs in this area, though specific identifications remain debated.<p><b>And his son Ahaziah reigned in his place.</b><br>Ahaziah's ascension to the throne marks the continuation of the Davidic dynasty, despite the spiritual decline during Jehoram's reign. Ahaziah's rule was brief and also characterized by evil, as he followed the counsel of his mother Athaliah and the house of Ahab. This transition of power highlights the dynastic struggles and the influence of foreign alliances, particularly with the northern kingdom of Israel. Ahaziah's reign is a reminder of the consequences of departing from God's commandments, as seen in the prophetic warnings given to the house of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joram.htm">Joram (Jehoram)</a></b><br>King of Judah, son of Jehoshaphat.
