In the context of ancient Near Eastern customs, sharing a meal often signified a time of reflection or celebration. Jehu had just executed Jezebel, fulfilling the prophecy against her. His decision to eat and drink may indicate a sense of completion or satisfaction in carrying out God's judgment. This moment also contrasts with the urgency of his previous actions, highlighting a shift from action to contemplation.<p><b>&#8220;Take care of this cursed woman,&#8221; he said,</b><br>The term "cursed woman" refers to Jezebel, who was notorious for her idolatry and persecution of the prophets of Yahweh. Her actions had brought a curse upon herself, as prophesied by Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>. Jehu's command to "take care" of her body, despite her being cursed, reflects a recognition of her status and the need to adhere to burial customs, even for those who were considered enemies or accursed.<p><b>&#8220;and bury her,</b><br>In ancient Israelite culture, burial was an important practice, even for those who had died under judgment. Proper burial was seen as a sign of respect and a way to ensure rest for the deceased. Jehu's command to bury Jezebel, despite her wickedness, underscores the cultural importance of burial rites. It also fulfills the prophecy that her body would be eaten by dogs, leaving nothing to bury, as a sign of her disgrace (<a href="/2_kings/9-10.htm">2 Kings 9:10</a>).<p><b>for she was the daughter of a king.&#8221;</b><br>Jezebel was the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians, which gave her a royal status. This acknowledgment by Jehu highlights the political and familial connections that Jezebel had, which were significant in the ancient world. Her royal lineage did not exempt her from judgment, but it did warrant a certain level of respect in death. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the influence and reach of foreign powers and their gods within Israel, which Jezebel had embodied and promoted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>Anointed king of Israel, tasked with eradicating the house of Ahab and executing divine judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezebel.htm">Jezebel</a></b><br>The wife of King Ahab, known for her idolatry and persecution of the prophets of Yahweh.

The pause also highlights the normalcy of God-ordained justice; for the righteous, obedient action brings peace rather than remorse (<a href="/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The command: &#8220;Take care of this cursed woman&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jezebel is called &#8220;cursed&#8221; because her life epitomized rebellion against the Lord&#8212;idolatry, murder of prophets, and manipulation of Israel&#8217;s throne (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>; 21:8-15; <a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehu&#8217;s words echo the prophecy spoken by Elijah: dogs would devour Jezebel at Jezreel (<a href="/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>).<p>&#8226; By labeling her &#8220;cursed,&#8221; Jehu affirms that God&#8217;s earlier word has now reached its climax, just as <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a> declares a curse on idol worshipers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Burial instructions and respect for royal blood</b><p>&#8220;and bury her, for she was the daughter of a king.&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/9-34.htm">2 Kings 9:34</a>b)<p>&#8226; Even amid judgment, Jehu recognizes a residual honor due to Jezebel&#8217;s royal lineage&#8212;she was the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>).<p>&#8226;

The instruction fulfills the balance of justice and mercy: God&#8217;s sentence stands, yet the king&#8217;s daughter should receive burial if any remains can be found. Ironically, dogs had already consumed her (vv. 35-37), proving God&#8217;s prophecy precise (<a href="/jeremiah/1-12.htm">Jeremiah 1:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/9-34.htm">2 Kings 9:34</a> records Jehu&#8217;s immediate response after executing God&#8217;s judgment on Jezebel. His meal signals mission accomplished; the label &#8220;cursed&#8221; acknowledges divine condemnation; the burial order shows residual respect for royal status. Together these details reveal God&#8217;s justice as certain, Scripture&#8217;s prophecies as exact, and righteous leaders as able to rest in obedience while still upholding honor where it is due.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">And when . . . drink.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And he went in</span> (into the palace), <span class= "ital">and ate and drank</span>.

Perhaps he feared lest further insult to the corpse might provoke the resentment of the Phoenician monarch, and draw down upon him that prince's hostility. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/9-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then [Jehu] went in</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
