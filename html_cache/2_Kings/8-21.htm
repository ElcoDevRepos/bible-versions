The crossing to Zair indicates a strategic move, likely intended to suppress a rebellion. Zair's exact location is uncertain, but it is thought to be in the region of Edom, south of the Dead Sea. The use of "all his chariots" suggests a significant military force, highlighting the seriousness of the threat posed by Edom's revolt. Chariots were a symbol of military strength and technological advancement in ancient warfare, often used for their speed and power in battle.<p><b>When the Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders,</b><br>The Edomites, descendants of Esau, had a long history of conflict with Israel and Judah. Their ability to surround Jehoram and his commanders indicates a well-coordinated and effective military strategy. This situation reflects the ongoing tension and hostilities between the two nations, which can be traced back to the sibling rivalry between Jacob and Esau. The surrounding of Jehoram's forces suggests a moment of vulnerability and potential defeat for Judah.<p><b>he rose up and attacked by night.</b><br>Jehoram's decision to attack by night demonstrates tactical acumen and a willingness to take risks. Night attacks were less common due to the difficulties of coordination and communication in the dark, but they could provide the element of surprise. This action shows Jehoram's determination to overcome the encirclement and turn the tide of battle. The use of night as a cover for military maneuvers is a recurring theme in biblical warfare, emphasizing the importance of strategy and divine intervention in achieving victory.<p><b>His troops, however, fled to their homes.</b><br>Despite Jehoram's bold night attack, his troops ultimately fled, indicating a lack of morale or confidence in their leadership. This retreat suggests internal issues within the army or a recognition of the overwhelming strength of the Edomites. The phrase "fled to their homes" implies a disorganized and hasty retreat, which would have been seen as a disgrace in the context of ancient warfare. This outcome highlights the challenges faced by Jehoram's reign and foreshadows the continued decline of Judah's power during this period. The failure of Jehoram's campaign against Edom can be seen as part of the broader narrative of Judah's struggles with faithfulness to God and the consequences of turning away from divine guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joram.htm">Joram (Jehoram)</a></b><br>King of Judah, son of Jehoshaphat.

He throws every chariot at Edom yet ends surrounded. His daring night strike gains no lasting success because his troops, sensing God&#8217;s displeasure, break ranks and flee. The verse stands as a sober reminder that national strength, tactical skill, and personal courage cannot substitute for covenant loyalty.

Moreover, if Mount Seir were intended, it would probably have had the prefix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, as in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-42.htm">1 Chronicles 4:42</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-10.htm">2 Chronicles 20:10, 22, 23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/35-2.htm">Ezekiel 35:2, 3, 7, 15</a>. "Seir" alone is poetical rather than historical, especially in the language of the later books of the Old Testament. <span class="cmt_word">And all the chariots with him</span>; or, <span class="accented">all his chariots</span> (Revised Version). The article has the force of the possessive pronoun. <span class="cmt_word">And he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about.</span> Josephus understands the writer to mean that Joram made his invasion by night, and smote the Edomites on all sides ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:5. &sect; 1); but it seems better to suppose, with most modern commentators, that the meaning is the following: Soon after Joram invaded the country, he found himself surrounded and blocked in by the Edomite troops, and could only save himself by a night attack, which was so far successful that he broke through the enemy's lines and escaped; his army, however, was so alarmed at the danger it had run, that it at once dispersed and returned home<span class="cmt_word">. And the captains of the chariots</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the captains of the Edomite chariots. They too were "smitten," having probably taken the chief part in trying to prevent the escape. <span class="cmt_word">And the people fled into their tents</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dispersed to their homes.
