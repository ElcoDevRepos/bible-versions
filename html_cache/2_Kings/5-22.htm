This phrase is deceptive, as Gehazi is about to lie to Naaman. In biblical narratives, servants often play crucial roles, and their actions can reflect the moral and spiritual state of the people they serve. Gehazi's lie contrasts with Elisha's integrity and foreshadows the consequences of deceit. The phrase also highlights the theme of peace and security, which is disrupted by Gehazi's actions.<p><b>&#8220;My master has sent me to say,&#8221;</b><br>Gehazi falsely claims to be acting on Elisha's behalf. This misuse of authority is significant in biblical texts, where prophets are seen as direct representatives of God. Gehazi's lie is not just a personal failing but an affront to the divine authority Elisha represents. This act of deception can be compared to other biblical figures who misused their positions, such as Ananias and Sapphira in <a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Look, two young men from the sons of the prophets have just now come to me&#8221;</b><br>The "sons of the prophets" were groups of prophetic disciples or communities that existed during the time of Elijah and Elisha. They were dedicated to learning and living out the prophetic tradition. Gehazi's mention of them adds a layer of credibility to his story, as these groups were known for their piety and dedication. The reference to "two young men" suggests a plausible need, as hospitality and provision for fellow believers were important cultural values.<p><b>&#8220;from the hill country of Ephraim.&#8221;</b><br>Ephraim was a significant region in the northern kingdom of Israel, known for its rugged terrain and historical importance. It was the territory of one of the prominent tribes of Israel, often associated with strength and leadership. The mention of Ephraim may evoke the idea of a legitimate and urgent need, as travelers from this area would have faced a long journey. This geographical detail adds realism to Gehazi's fabricated story.<p><b>&#8220;Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.&#8221;</b><br>A talent of silver was a substantial amount of money, indicating the seriousness of Gehazi's greed. In ancient times, clothing was a valuable commodity, often used as a form of wealth or status symbol. Gehazi's request for two sets of clothing further emphasizes his deceitful intentions, as he seeks to enrich himself under the guise of helping others. This request contrasts with the biblical teaching of contentment and reliance on God's provision, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6-10</a>. The act of asking for silver and clothing also reflects the material temptations that can lead individuals away from spiritual truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gehazi.htm">Gehazi</a></b><br>The servant of Elisha, the prophet.
