The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting that he joined his ancestors in the afterlife. Manasseh's reign was marked by idolatry and evil practices, as detailed earlier in <a href="/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21</a>, but he also repented later in life, as recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/33-12.htm">2 Chronicles 33:12-13</a>. His death marks the end of a tumultuous period in Judah's history.<p><b>and was buried in his palace garden, the garden of Uzza.</b><br>The burial in the palace garden, rather than the traditional burial in the City of David, may reflect the disgrace associated with Manasseh's reign. The garden of Uzza is mentioned only here and in <a href="/2_kings/21-26.htm">2 Kings 21:26</a>, and its exact location is unknown, though it is presumed to be near the royal palace in Jerusalem. This unusual burial site might indicate a deviation from royal customs, possibly due to his controversial reign or personal choice.<p><b>And his son Amon reigned in his place.</b><br>Amon succeeded Manasseh as king of Judah, continuing the dynastic line of David. Amon's reign was short, lasting only two years, and he followed in the sinful practices of his father before his repentance, as noted in <a href="/2_kings/21-20.htm">2 Kings 21:20-22</a>. His reign ended abruptly when he was assassinated by his own servants, leading to the ascension of his son Josiah, who would become one of Judah's most righteous kings. This transition highlights the instability and moral decline in Judah during this period, setting the stage for Josiah's reforms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>He was the king of Judah who reigned for 55 years, known for his idolatry and leading Judah into sin.

Thenius argues that the garden of Uzza lay in the Tyrop?on, at the foot of the spur of Ophel. (Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/6-8.htm" title="And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach on Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.">2Samuel 6:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/8-7.htm" title="And Naaman, and Ahiah, and Gera, he removed them, and begat Uzza, and Ahihud.">1Chronicles 8:7</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-49.htm" title="The children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the children of Besai,">Ezra 2:49</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-51.htm" title="The children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Phaseah,">Nehemiah 7:51</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house.</span> We have already seen reason for believing that the catacomb of David was full, and that Hezekiah was buried outside it, though in the neighborhood, on this account (see the comment on 2 Kings 20:21). Manasseh seems to have made a new family tomb in a garden belonging to his house (see ver. 26; and comp. <a href="/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>). It is quite impossible to fix its site. <span class="cmt_word">In the garden of Uzza.</span> Probably an addition to the old palace garden; perhaps a purchase made by Manasseh with the object of converting it into a burial-ground. "Uzza," or "Uzzah," was a common name among the Jews (<a href="/2_samuel/6-8.htm">2 Samuel 6:8</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-49.htm">Ezra 2:49</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-51.htm">Nehemiah 7:51</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-29.htm">1 Chronicles 6:29</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/8-7.htm">1 Chronicles 8:7</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/13-7.htm">1 Chronicles 13:7-11</a>), and does not point to any definite individual. <span class="cmt_word">And Amen his son reigned in his stead.</span> "Amon" in Hebrew means "Nursling," or "Darling," and it is quite possible that Manasseh gave his son the name in this sense. But it is also the ordinary Hebrew form of the term ("Amen," or "Amun") by which the Egyptians designated the great god of Thebes, whom the Greeks and Romans called "Ammon." It has therefore been thought by many that it was given by Manasseh to his son "in an idolatrous spirit." So Bishop Cotton in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 61, and others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/21-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Manasseh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;na&#353;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4519.htm">Strong's 4519: </a> </span><span class="str2">Manasseh -- 'causing to forget', a son of Joseph, also a king of Judah, also two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rested</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;ka&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
