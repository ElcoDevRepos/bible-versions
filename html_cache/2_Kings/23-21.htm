Josiah was known for his religious reforms and efforts to restore the worship of Yahweh. His command to all the people signifies a national call to return to the covenantal practices outlined in the Mosaic Law. This reflects the king's authority and responsibility to lead the nation in spiritual matters, emphasizing the communal aspect of worship in ancient Israel.<p><b>Keep the Passover of the LORD your God</b><br>The Passover is a significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from slavery in Egypt, as described in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>. It involves the sacrifice of a lamb and the eating of unleavened bread, symbolizing God's salvation and the haste of the Israelites' departure. Josiah's command to keep the Passover highlights a return to foundational religious practices that had been neglected. This observance is a reminder of God's faithfulness and deliverance, serving as a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "Lamb of God" in the New Testament (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>as it is written in this Book of the Covenant</b><br>The "Book of the Covenant" likely refers to the rediscovered book of the Law, possibly Deuteronomy, found during temple renovations (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>). This discovery sparked Josiah's reforms and a renewed commitment to the covenantal laws. The phrase underscores the importance of adhering to the written Word of God as the standard for religious practice and moral conduct. It also reflects the centrality of Scripture in guiding the community's faith and actions, a principle echoed throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, which describes God's Word as a lamp to one's feet and a light to one's path.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_josiah.htm">King Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and sought to restore the worship of Yahweh according to the covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the southern kingdom who were commanded by Josiah to observe the Passover.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, symbolizing redemption and obedience to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_book_of_the_covenant.htm">The Book of the Covenant</a></b><br>Likely referring to the rediscovered book of the Law, which inspired Josiah's reforms and the renewed observance of the Passover.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship in Judah where the Passover was to be celebrated.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_word.htm">Obedience to God's Word</a></b><br>Josiah's command to keep the Passover underscores the importance of aligning our lives with Scripture.

Obedience to the written word reconnects God&#8217;s people to their redemptive roots and realigns them under His sovereign rule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Keep the passover.</span>--<span class= "ital">Hold a passover</span> (<a href="/2_kings/23-22.htm" title="Surely there was not held such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;">2Kings 23:22</a>).

In Chronicles it occupies nineteen verses of <a href="/2_chronicles/35.htm">2 Chronicles 35</a>. We learn from Chronicles that all the rites prescribed by the Law, whether in Exodus, Leviticus, or Deuteronomy, were duly observed, and that the festival was attended, not only by the Judaeans, but by many Israelites from among the ten tribes, who still remained intermixed with the Assyrian colonists in the Samaritan country (see <a href="/2_chronicles/35-17.htm">2 Chronicles 35:17, 18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Lord your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.</span> The ordinances for the due observance of the Passover feast are contained chiefly in Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-20</a>; <a href="/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5-10</a>). They are repeated, but with much less fullness, in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1-8</a>.
