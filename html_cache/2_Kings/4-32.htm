His journey to the house signifies his role as a mediator of God's power. The context involves the Shunammite woman, who had shown hospitality to Elisha and was blessed with a son. This event takes place in Shunem, a town in the territory of Issachar, highlighting the geographical setting of Elisha's ministry in the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Elisha's arrival underscores the importance of prophetic presence in times of crisis, reflecting the role of prophets as God's representatives.<p><b>there was the boy</b><br>The boy is the miraculous child promised to the Shunammite woman by Elisha. His presence in the narrative emphasizes the fulfillment of God's promises through the prophet. The boy's death presents a crisis of faith and a test of the woman's trust in God's word. This situation parallels other biblical accounts where God tests faith through trials, such as Abraham with Isaac.<p><b>lying dead on his bed</b><br>The boy's death is a pivotal moment, symbolizing the fragility of life and the reality of human mortality. The bed, a place of rest, becomes a place of death, highlighting the reversal of expectations. This scene sets the stage for a miraculous intervention, foreshadowing resurrection themes found throughout Scripture. It prefigures the power of God to bring life from death, a theme ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ's resurrection. The narrative invites reflection on the sovereignty of God over life and death, and the hope of restoration through divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet and successor of Elijah, known for performing miracles and being a man of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shunammite_woman.htm">The Shunammite Woman</a></b><br>A hospitable and faithful woman who provided for Elisha and was blessed with a son through his prophecy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shunammite's_son.htm">The Shunammite's Son</a></b><br>The child miraculously given to the Shunammite woman, who later fell ill and died.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shunem.htm">Shunem</a></b><br>The town where the Shunammite woman lived, located in the territory of Issachar.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha's_room.htm">Elisha's Room</a></b><br>A special room prepared by the Shunammite woman for Elisha, symbolizing her faith and hospitality.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>The Shunammite woman's account encourages believers to trust in God's promises, even when circumstances seem dire.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer_and_persistence.htm">The Power of Prayer and Persistence</a></b><br>Her journey to seek Elisha's help demonstrates the importance of persistent prayer and seeking God's intervention.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_life_and_death.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Life and Death</a></b><br>Elisha's miracle underscores God's ultimate authority over life and death, reminding us of His power and compassion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hospitality_and_generosity.htm">Hospitality and Generosity</a></b><br>The Shunammite woman's hospitality towards Elisha serves as a model for believers to be generous and open-hearted.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophets_and_god's_servants.htm">The Role of Prophets and God's Servants</a></b><br>Elisha's actions remind us of the importance of God's servants in delivering His message and performing His works.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_4_32_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 4:32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Elisha_s_faith_in_2_Kings_4_32.htm">How does Elisha's action in 2 Kings 4:32 demonstrate faith in God's power?

Like Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/17-19.htm">1 Kings 17:19&#8211;23</a>, Elisha comes in obedience to God, fully expecting divine intervention.<p>- His journey displays persistence. Earlier, he had sent Gehazi ahead with his staff (<a href="/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29&#8211;31</a>), yet he continues until he himself stands at the threshold. Presence matters; compare Jesus going to Jairus&#8217;s home in <a href="/mark/5-35.htm">Mark 5:35&#8211;40</a>.<p>- The scene underscores covenant faithfulness: God&#8217;s spokesman steps into the Shunammite&#8217;s household, honoring her earlier hospitality (<a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8&#8211;10</a>). <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7&#8211;10</a> echoes that God repays sowing in faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There was the boy</b><p>- Scripture stresses the reality of the child&#8217;s condition. Nothing is hidden or minimized. <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a> notes that everything is laid bare before the Lord.<p>- The definite article&#8212;&#8220;the boy&#8221;&#8212;recalls the promised son given in answer to the woman&#8217;s plea (<a href="/2_kings/4-16.htm">2 Kings 4:16&#8211;17</a>). God&#8217;s gift is now seemingly lost, heightening the test of faith (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2&#8211;4</a>).<p>- By drawing attention to &#8220;the boy,&#8221; the narrative reminds us that God values individuals, not just crowds (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lying dead</b><p>- Death is presented as an undeniable fact, not a metaphor. <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a> affirms that death entered through sin; here it confronts a family of faith.<p>- The finality of death sets the stage for a resurrection miracle, prefiguring Christ&#8217;s triumph over the grave in <a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43&#8211;44</a>.<p>- Human helplessness is exposed. Neither the mother&#8217;s love nor Gehazi&#8217;s staff availed; only divine power can reverse death (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On his bed</b><p>- The child remains in the very room Elisha had used (<a href="/2_kings/4-10.htm">2 Kings 4:10</a>). What was a place of rest for the prophet becomes a place of restoration for the boy.<p>- Keeping him on the bed preserves dignity and anticipates revival, much like the orderly placement of Jairus&#8217;s daughter in <a href="/luke/8-54.htm">Luke 8:54&#8211;55</a>.<p>- The setting invites privacy and focus. Miracles often occur away from spectacle, emphasizing God&#8217;s glory rather than human showmanship (<a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/4-32.htm">2 Kings 4:32</a> paints a stark scene: God&#8217;s prophet standing before a promised child now dead. Each phrase elevates themes of faithful presence, personal worth, the reality of death, and the intimate setting God chooses for His power to work. The verse prepares us to witness the Lord&#8217;s life-giving authority through Elisha, foreshadowing the ultimate victory over death revealed in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed</span> (comp. ver. 21).
