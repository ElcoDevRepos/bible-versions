This role was akin to a chief of staff or prime minister, responsible for managing the king's household and affairs. Eliakim's appointment reflects Hezekiah's trust in him, especially during a time of crisis. His lineage, being the son of Hilkiah, suggests a family of some standing, possibly with priestly connections, as Hilkiah is a name associated with priests in other biblical contexts.<p><b>Shebna the scribe</b><br>Shebna served as the scribe, a position of high authority responsible for recording events, drafting official documents, and advising the king. In <a href="/isaiah/22.htm">Isaiah 22</a>, Shebna is criticized for his pride and self-aggrandizement, indicating a complex character who may have had ambitions beyond his station. His presence here suggests his continued involvement in state affairs despite any previous rebukes.<p><b>and Asaph&#8217;s son Joah the recorder</b><br>Joah, son of Asaph, held the position of recorder, a role that involved chronicling events and maintaining official records. The mention of Asaph connects Joah to a lineage known for its musical and liturgical contributions, as Asaph was a prominent figure in the time of David, known for his psalms. This connection may imply a family tradition of service to the kingdom.<p><b>came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn</b><br>The tearing of clothes is a traditional expression of mourning, distress, or repentance in ancient Israelite culture. This act signifies the gravity of the situation and the officials' deep concern over the Assyrian threat. It reflects a state of national crisis and a plea for divine intervention, as seen in other biblical instances where leaders or prophets tore their garments in response to calamity or sin.<p><b>and they relayed to him the words of the Rabshakeh</b><br>The Rabshakeh was a high-ranking Assyrian official, likely a field commander or chief cupbearer, who delivered a message of intimidation and blasphemy against the God of Israel. His words were intended to demoralize the people of Judah and persuade them to surrender. The relaying of his words to Hezekiah underscores the seriousness of the Assyrian threat and sets the stage for Hezekiah's response, which involves seeking the counsel of the prophet Isaiah and turning to God in prayer. This moment highlights the tension between human power and divine sovereignty, a recurring theme in the narrative of Hezekiah's reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliakim_son_of_hilkiah.htm">Eliakim son of Hilkiah</a></b><br>He was the palace administrator, a high-ranking official in King Hezekiah's court, responsible for managing the affairs of the royal household.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shebna_the_scribe.htm">Shebna the scribe</a></b><br>A scribe or secretary, Shebna was responsible for recording and managing official documents and communications.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joah_son_of_asaph.htm">Joah son of Asaph</a></b><br>The recorder, Joah was tasked with chronicling events and maintaining records, serving as a historian of sorts for the kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and efforts to reform the religious practices of his people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabshakeh.htm">Rabshakeh</a></b><br>An Assyrian official and spokesman for King Sennacherib, who delivered a message intended to intimidate and demoralize the people of Judah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_faithful_leadership.htm">The Power of Faithful Leadership</a></b><br>Hezekiah's reliance on God during a crisis serves as a model for leaders today.

Their torn clothes testify to helplessness; their faithful relay of Rabshakeh&#8217;s words positions Hezekiah&#8212;and ultimately the LORD&#8212;to answer the threat.

They were blasphemies, no doubt, arising from "invincible ignorance," and not intended as insults to the one Almighty Being who rules the earth, of whose existence Rabshakeh had probably no conception; but they struck on Jewish ears as insults to Jehovah, and therefore as dreadful and horrible (comp. <a href="/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>; <a href="/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And told him the words of Rabshakeh</span>; reported to him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as nearly as they could, all that Rabshakeh had said. The three envoys would supplement, and perhaps correct, one another; and Hezekiah would have conveyed to him a full and, on the whole, exact account of the message sent to him through Rabshakeh by the Assyrian king, and of Rabshakeh's method of enforcing it. The crisis of Hezekiah's life was reached. As he acted under it would be fixed his own fate, his character in the judgment of all future time, and the fate of his own country. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/18-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Hilkiah's</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;il&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2518.htm">Strong's 2518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hilkiah -- 'my portion is Yah', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Eliakim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_471.htm">Strong's 471: </a> </span><span class="str2">Eliakim -- 'God sets up', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the palace</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1440;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;ba&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
