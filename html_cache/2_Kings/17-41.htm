The Assyrians had a policy of relocating conquered peoples to prevent rebellion, and they brought various groups into the region of Samaria. These people adopted the worship of Yahweh, likely due to the influence of the remaining Israelites and the fear of the "lions" sent by God (<a href="/2_kings/17-25.htm">2 Kings 17:25-28</a>). This reflects a superficial acknowledgment of the God of Israel, rather than a genuine conversion or understanding of His covenant.<p><b>but also served their idols</b><br>Despite acknowledging Yahweh, these nations continued to serve their own gods, reflecting a divided loyalty. This syncretism is condemned throughout the Old Testament, as God demands exclusive worship (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The practice of serving multiple gods was common in the ancient Near East, where each nation had its own deities. This behavior is reminiscent of the Israelites' own history of idolatry, which led to their downfall and exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>).<p><b>and to this day their children and grandchildren continue to do as their fathers did</b><br>This phrase indicates the persistence of idolatrous practices among the descendants of these nations. It underscores the enduring nature of cultural and religious traditions, even when they are contrary to God's commands. The phrase "to this day" suggests that the author of Kings was writing at a time when these practices were still observable, possibly during or after the Babylonian exile. This continuity of idolatry serves as a warning about the long-term consequences of failing to fully commit to God. It also highlights the importance of teaching future generations to follow the Lord wholeheartedly, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the various peoples who were settled in the land of Israel after the Assyrian conquest.

Not much confidence can be placed in these representations. The Babylonian gods were ordinarily figured in human forms. Animal ones - as those of the bull and the lion, generally winged and human-headed, were in a few cases, but only in a few, used to represent the gods symbolically. Other emblems employed were the winged circle for Asshur; the disc plain or four-rayed for the male sun, six or eight-rayed for the female sun; the crescent for the moon-god Sin; the thunderbolt for the god of the atmosphere, Vul or Rimmon; the wedge or arrow-head, the fundamental element of writing, for Nebo.
