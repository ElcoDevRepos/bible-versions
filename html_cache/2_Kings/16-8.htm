The silver and gold in the house of the LORD were sacred, dedicated to God, and intended for worship and the maintenance of the temple. By taking these treasures, Ahaz demonstrated a lack of reverence for the sanctity of the temple and a willingness to compromise his faith for political gain. This act can be contrasted with the actions of faithful kings like Hezekiah, who sought to restore and honor the temple (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4-6</a>).<p><b>and in the treasuries of the king&#8217;s palace</b><br>The treasuries of the king's palace were meant for the prosperity and security of the nation. By depleting these resources, Ahaz was prioritizing immediate political concerns over the long-term welfare of Judah. This reflects a broader theme in the Old Testament where reliance on human strength and alliances often leads to downfall, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>, which warns against relying on Egypt for help instead of God.<p><b>and he sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria</b><br>Ahaz sent these treasures to Tiglath-Pileser III, the king of Assyria, seeking his assistance against the threats from Israel and Aram. This act of sending a gift can be seen as a form of tribute or bribe, indicating subservience and a lack of trust in God's protection. Historically, Assyria was a dominant power, and aligning with them was a common political strategy, though it often led to further subjugation. This decision by Ahaz is criticized by prophets like Isaiah, who urged trust in God rather than foreign alliances (<a href="/isaiah/7-10.htm">Isaiah 7:10-13</a>). Theologically, this act foreshadows the eventual downfall of Judah, as reliance on Assyria would later contribute to its own invasion and exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned during a time of political turmoil and idolatry.

His decision to &#8220;take&#8221; rather than trust exposes a heart already bent toward self-reliance. Like King Asa before him, who emptied treasuries to hire Ben-hadad (<a href="/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18-19</a>), Ahaz mirrors a pattern: when crisis comes, plunder what is sacred instead of seeking the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the silver and gold found in the house of the LORD</b><p>These were dedicated items meant for worship, crafted at enormous cost (<a href="/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48-51</a>).

The holiness of God&#8217;s house is compromised for political insurance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in the treasuries of the king&#8217;s palace</b><p>Ahaz drains national reserves intended for his own administration and the people&#8217;s welfare.

Instead of crying to God (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-14.htm">Isaiah 37:14-20</a>), Ahaz sends money. This contrasts sharply with righteous Hezekiah, who after receiving Assyrian threats turned to prayer first (<a href="/2_kings/19-14.htm">2 Kings 19:14-19</a>), even though he too later faltered (<a href="/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12-13</a>).

By allying with Tiglath-Pileser, Ahaz rejects God&#8217;s promise to protect the Davidic line (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1-9</a>). The prophet Isaiah warned that reliance on Assyria would invite harsher domination (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>). <a href="/2_chronicles/28-20.htm">2 Chronicles 28:20-21</a> confirms the prophecy: &#8220;Tiglath-Pileser&#8230; gave him trouble instead of support.&#8221; Trust in human might brought bondage, proving <a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a> true: &#8220;Do not put your trust in princes, in mortal men who cannot save.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/16-8.htm">2 Kings 16:8</a> captures more than a financial transaction; it exposes the anatomy of faithless leadership. Ahaz pillages God&#8217;s temple and his own palace, trades holy treasures for political security, and in doing so shifts Judah&#8217;s trust from the LORD to a pagan empire. Scripture shows that whenever God&#8217;s people mortgage the sacred for short-term relief, they forfeit lasting peace. Ahaz&#8217;s example warns believers today to guard what is devoted to God and to lean on His covenant promises rather than worldly power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Ahaz took the silver and gold.</span>--"He was well aware that the only conditions on which protection would be vouchsafed were acceptance of the Assyrian suzerainty with the payment of a huge tribute, and an embassy was despatched laden with all the treasures of the palace and the Temple. The ambassadors had no difficulty in attaining their object, which perfectly fell in with the schemes of the great king. The invincible army was set in motion, Damascus was taken, and its inhabitants led captive, and Gilead and Galilee suffered the same fate" (<span class= "ital">Robertson Smith</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>.) According to Schrader, the expedition "to Philistia"in 734 B.C., was directed against Pekah, who probably saved himself by an instant submission. It was only after Tiglath had settled matters with the northern kingdom, and so isolated Damascus, that he turned his arms against Rezin. Two whole years were spent in reducing him (733-732 B.C. ) In an inscription dating from his seventeenth year, Tiglath Pileser mentions that he received tribute from Eniel, king of Hamath, Muthumbaal, king of Arvad, Sanibu of Ammon, Salamanu of Moab, Mitinti of Asca-lon, Jahuhazi (Jehoahaz, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Ahaz) of Judah, Qausmalaka of Edom, Hanun of Gaza, and other princes. This probably relates to the expedition of 734 B.C. , in which year, therefore, Ahaz (Jehoahaz) must have put himself under the protection of Assyria (Schrader, <span class= "ital">K.A.T.,</span> p. 257 <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house.</span> Hitherto the temple treasures had been diverted from their proper use, and secularized for the sole purpose (except in one instance) of buying off the hostility of foreign foe, who threatened the city and the temple itself with destruction (see <a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-14.htm">2 Kings 14:14</a>).
