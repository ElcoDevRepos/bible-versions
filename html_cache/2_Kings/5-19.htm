This phrase is often used in the Bible to convey a sense of divine approval and reconciliation. In the context of Naaman, a Syrian commander who was healed of leprosy, it indicates that Elisha acknowledges Naaman's newfound faith in the God of Israel. The peace Elisha refers to is not just physical or political but spiritual, reflecting the Hebrew concept of "shalom," which encompasses wholeness and harmony with God. This blessing is reminiscent of Jesus' words in the New Testament, where He often tells individuals to go in peace after healing them (e.g., <a href="/mark/5-34.htm">Mark 5:34</a>).<p><b>But after Naaman had traveled a short distance,</b><br>Naaman's journey back to Syria after his healing is significant. The "short distance" suggests that he had not gone far when the events that follow begin to unfold. This detail sets the stage for the subsequent actions of Gehazi, Elisha's servant, who pursues Naaman. The geographical context here is important; Naaman is returning from the Jordan River area, where he was instructed to wash and be cleansed. This area is rich in biblical history, being the site of many significant events, including the crossing of the Israelites into the Promised Land (Joshua 3-4). Naaman's journey symbolizes a transition from his old life of idolatry to a new life acknowledging the God of Israel. The short distance also implies that Naaman's heart and mind are still fresh with the experience of his healing and conversion, making the subsequent events more poignant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for performing miracles and serving as a spiritual leader.

God&#8217;s grace reaches across borders (<a href="/luke/4-27.htm">Luke 4:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: when God grants peace, the believer can move forward confidently, trusting that obedience in unfamiliar surroundings will still honor the LORD (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>said Elisha</b><p>&#8226; The prophet speaks for God (<a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11-12</a>), so his benediction carries divine authority. As surely as he earlier declared, &#8220;Thus says the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/5-10.htm">2 Kings 5:10</a>), his &#8220;Go in peace&#8221; now seals God&#8217;s verdict.<p>&#8226; Elisha does not burden Naaman with extra rules; the gospel&#8212;then and now&#8212;rests on faith, not on purchasing favor (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; His restraint contrasts sharply with Gehazi&#8217;s upcoming greed (vv. 20-27), highlighting that genuine ministry seeks the welfare of others, not personal gain (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; For modern disciples, speaking blessing in Christ&#8217;s name carries weight (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>; <a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a>); our words should reflect God&#8217;s heart, not our agendas.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But after Naaman had traveled a short distance</b><p>&#8226; The narrative pivot reminds us that every victory of grace is quickly tested. Naaman departs in integrity; Gehazi will pursue him in deceit (v. 20).<p>&#8226; Scripture often records a blessing followed by an immediate challenge&#8212;think of Jesus&#8217; baptism and the wilderness temptation (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17&#8211;4</a>:1). Expecting such tests keeps believers alert (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Naaman&#8217;s &#8220;short distance&#8221; underscores how fresh converts remain vulnerable; established believers must guard them, not exploit them (<a href="/romans/14-13.htm">Romans 14:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also sets up a stark contrast: Naaman leaves light-hearted and healed, while Gehazi will return heavy-hearted and leprous (v. 27), illustrating <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, &#8220;God is not mocked.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elisha&#8217;s &#8220;Go in peace&#8221; affirms that Naaman now stands whole before God&#8212;physically cleansed, spiritually reconciled, and free to live out his new faith. The prophet&#8217;s authoritative blessing embodies God&#8217;s gracious acceptance, while the quick shift to Gehazi&#8217;s scheme warns that peace can be disturbed by covetous hearts. For us, the verse teaches that true ministry releases people into God&#8217;s shalom, trusts Him to guide them afterward, and stays vigilant against the very greed that would rob both sender and receiver of that peace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">A little way.</span>--Heb., a <span class= "ital">kibr?h</span> of ground (<a href="/genesis/35-16.htm" title="And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.">Genesis 35:16</a>).
