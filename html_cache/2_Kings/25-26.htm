The mention of "small and great" reflects the widespread impact of the Babylonian conquest, affecting everyone from the common people to the elite. This mirrors the earlier biblical theme of God's judgment affecting all levels of society, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>, where both "small and great" are mentioned in the context of corruption and impending judgment.<p><b>together with the commanders of the army</b><br>The inclusion of military leaders highlights the complete collapse of Judah's defense and leadership structure. The commanders, who were responsible for the protection and strategic decisions of the nation, are now fleeing, indicating a total defeat and loss of hope. This aligns with the prophecies of Jeremiah, who warned that Judah's military would be powerless against Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/21-4.htm">Jeremiah 21:4-5</a>).<p><b>arose and fled to Egypt</b><br>Fleeing to Egypt signifies a reversal of the Exodus, where the Israelites originally left Egypt for the Promised Land. This retreat symbolizes a return to bondage and a lack of trust in God's deliverance. Historically, Egypt was often seen as a place of refuge, but also a place of spiritual and physical danger, as warned by prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>). This action reflects a failure to heed God's warnings through prophets like Jeremiah, who advised against seeking refuge in Egypt (<a href="/jeremiah/42-19.htm">Jeremiah 42:19-22</a>).<p><b>for fear of the Chaldeans</b><br>The Chaldeans, synonymous with the Babylonians, were the dominant power and a tool of God's judgment against Judah. The fear of the Chaldeans underscores the fulfillment of prophetic warnings about Babylon's role in God's plan (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>). This fear-driven flight contrasts with the biblical call to trust in God rather than in human alliances or solutions. The Chaldeans' role as instruments of divine judgment is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, emphasizing God's sovereignty over nations and history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>This refers to the remaining inhabitants of Judah after the Babylonian conquest.

The leader of the movement was Johanan, the son of Careah. Having first attacked Ishmael, and forced him to fly to the Ammonites (<a href="/jeremiah/41-15.htm">Jeremiah 41:15</a>), he almost immediately afterwards conceived a fear of Nebuchadnezzar, who would, he thought, resent the murder of Gedaliah, and even avenge it upon these who had done all they could to prevent it. He therefore gathered together the people, and made a preliminary retreat to Chimham, near Bethlehem (<a href="/jeremiah/41-17.htm">Jeremiah 41:17</a>), on the road to Egypt, whence he subsequently, against the earnest remonstrances and prophetic warnings of <a href="/jeremiah/42-9.htm">Jeremiah 42:9-22</a>, carried them on into Egypt itself (<a href="/jeremiah/43-1.htm">Jeremiah 43:1-7</a>).
