This command is part of a prophetic act, a common practice in the Old Testament where physical actions symbolize spiritual truths or future events. Arrows in ancient warfare were symbols of power and victory. Elisha's instruction to take the arrows signifies preparation for battle and the potential for victory over enemies.<p><b>So he took them,</b><br>The king's compliance with Elisha's command demonstrates a willingness to follow prophetic guidance. This act of obedience is crucial, as it sets the stage for the subsequent prophetic message. In biblical narratives, obedience to God's prophets often leads to divine intervention or blessing.<p><b>and Elisha said to the king of Israel, &#8220;Strike the ground!&#8221;</b><br>Elisha's command to strike the ground is symbolic, representing an act of aggression against Israel's enemies, particularly the Arameans. The ground here can be seen as a metaphor for the battlefield. This action is a prophetic gesture, indicating that the number of strikes will correlate with the number of victories granted by God.<p><b>So he struck the ground three times and stopped.</b><br>The king's decision to strike the ground only three times reflects a lack of full commitment or understanding of the prophetic act's significance. In the context of the narrative, this limited action results in a limited victory over the Arameans. This moment highlights the importance of faith and complete trust in God's promises. The number three, while often significant in Scripture, here indicates incompleteness, as the king's actions fall short of the full potential victory God intended.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for performing miracles and providing guidance to the kings of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel</a></b><br>At this time, Jehoash (also known as Joash), who sought Elisha's counsel regarding the Arameans.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/arrows.htm">Arrows</a></b><br>Symbolic tools used by Elisha to convey God's message and promise of victory over Aram.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/ground.htm">Ground</a></b><br>The physical location where the symbolic act of striking the arrows took place, representing the battlefield.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/arameans.htm">Arameans</a></b><br>The enemy nation threatening Israel, against whom the prophetic act was directed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>The king's partial obedience resulted in limited victory.

But some contrast seems to be intended between the "shoot" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>) of ver. 19 and the "strike" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>) of the present passage. Ewald's explanation is thus to be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">And he smote thrice, and stayed.</span> Joash struck with the arrows against the floor three times, and then paused, thinking he had done enough. He did not enter into the spirit of the symbolical act, which represented the smiting and slaying of enemies. Perhaps he had not much faith in the virtue of the symbolism, which he may even, with the arrogance of a proud and worldly minded man, have thought childish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/13-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Elisha said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1435;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
