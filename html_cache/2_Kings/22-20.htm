In ancient Israel, being "gathered to one's fathers" was a euphemism for death and implied a peaceful transition to the afterlife, often seen as a blessing. This reflects the cultural importance of family lineage and burial practices in Israelite society. The phrase also suggests a continuation of the covenantal relationship with God, as being gathered to one's fathers implies joining the faithful who have gone before.<p><b>and you will be gathered to your grave in peace</b><br>Despite the impending judgment on Judah, Josiah is promised a peaceful death. Historically, Josiah was one of the few kings of Judah who followed the Lord wholeheartedly, as seen in his reforms and the restoration of the temple. This promise of peace at death is significant, as it contrasts with the turmoil and destruction that would follow his reign. It highlights God's mercy and justice, rewarding Josiah's faithfulness. Theologically, it can be seen as a type of Christ, who also brought peace through His obedience and sacrifice.<p><b>Your eyes will not see all the calamity that I will bring on this place</b><br>This part of the prophecy assures Josiah that he will not witness the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, which would occur after his death. The calamity refers to the Babylonian invasion and exile, a pivotal event in Israel's history. This promise underscores the severity of Judah's sin and the inevitability of God's judgment, yet it also shows God's compassion in sparing Josiah from witnessing the downfall. It connects to other scriptures where God spares the righteous from witnessing judgment, such as Lot being removed from Sodom.<p><b>So they brought her answer back to the king</b><br>The "her" refers to Huldah the prophetess, who delivered God's message to Josiah's messengers. This highlights the role of women in prophetic ministry in ancient Israel, showing that God spoke through both men and women. Huldah's prophecy was crucial in confirming the authenticity of the Book of the Law found in the temple and in guiding Josiah's response. This reflects the importance of prophetic voices in guiding the kings and the nation, and it emphasizes the need for leaders to seek and heed God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_josiah.htm">King Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and sought to restore the worship of Yahweh.

But the contradiction is not a real one. Huldah was commissioned to assure Josiah that, though the destruction of his kingdom and the desolation of Judaea and Jerusalem, threatened in the Law, were at hand, yet they would not come in his day. He would not see the evil time. Before it came he would be "gathered to his fathers" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in Jerusalem, as his predecessors had been (<a href="/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>), and not hurried off into captivity, to die in a foreign land, or given "the burial of an ass, drawn and east forth before the gates of Jerusalem" (<a href="/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>). The promise given him was fulfilled. He died in battle; but he was buried in peace (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-24.htm">2 Chronicles 35:24, 25</a>); and the fated enemy who was to destroy Jerusalem, and carry the Jewish nation into captivity, did not make any attack upon the land until three years later, when he was departed to his rest, and the throne was occupied by Jehoiakim (see <a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place</span>; e.g. the three sieges of Nebuchadnezzar, the destruction of the temple and city by Nebuzaradan (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9, 10</a>), the deportation of the bulk of the inhabitants (<a href="/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>), and the calamities which happened to the remnant left (<a href="/2_kings/25-22.htm">2 Kings 25:22-26</a>).
