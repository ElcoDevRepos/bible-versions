This reflects the transition of prophetic authority from Elijah to Elisha, a significant moment in Israel's spiritual history.<p><b>"we your servants have fifty valiant men."</b><br>The mention of "fifty valiant men" indicates a group ready for action, emphasizing their willingness to serve and their physical capability. The number fifty may symbolize completeness or readiness, as seen in other biblical contexts, such as the Jubilee year.<p><b>"Please let them go and search for your master."</b><br>The request to search for Elijah shows a lack of understanding or acceptance of Elijah's divine departure. It reflects human nature's struggle to comprehend miraculous events and the tendency to seek physical explanations for spiritual occurrences.<p><b>"Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up"</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the power of the Spirit of the LORD, which had previously been demonstrated in Elijah's life. It connects to the miraculous nature of Elijah's ascension, reminiscent of Enoch's translation in <a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a> and foreshadowing the ascension of Jesus in <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a>.<p><b>"and put him on one of the mountains or in one of the valleys."</b><br>The geographical reference to mountains and valleys suggests a search area within the rugged terrain of Israel, highlighting the natural landscape where many biblical events occurred. Mountains often symbolize places of divine encounter, as seen with Moses on Mount Sinai.<p><b>"Do not send them," Elisha replied.</b><br>Elisha's response demonstrates his understanding and acceptance of Elijah's divine departure. It reflects his confidence in God's plan and his role as Elijah's successor.

The verse challenges us to accept Scripture&#8217;s plain testimony, trusting the Spirit&#8217;s power to act beyond natural boundaries, and to follow godly leadership that rests on what God has already revealed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">And they said unto him.</span>--After he had told them of the Assumption of Elijah (<span class= "ital">Thenius</span>).<p><span class= "bld">Fifty strong men.</span>--See margin. Perhaps these were attendants on the members of the prophetic guild. (Comp. Elisha's servant Gehazi, and the fifty sons of the prophets, in <a href="/2_kings/2-7.htm" title="And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.">2Kings 2:7</a>.) Their being "sons of valour" was important, as the search in the mountains would involve danger.<p><span class= "bld">The Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up.</span>--Comp. <a href="/1_kings/18-12.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry you where I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he shall slay me: but I your servant fear the LORD from my youth.">1Kings 18:12</a>; <a href="/context/acts/8-39.htm" title="And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.">Acts 8:39-40</a>. This suggestion of the sons of the prophets is a good comment on <a href="/context/2_kings/2-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.">2Kings 2:11-12</a>. It shows that what is there told is certainly <span class= "ital">not</span> that Elijah ascended a fiery chariot and rode visibly into heaven, as the popular notion is.<p><span class= "bld">Upon some mountain, or into some valley.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">on to one of the mountains, or into one of the valleys,</span> of the land of Gilead. The motive of the disciples was not a desire to pay the last honours to the body of the departed master, as Keil suggests; for they rather expected to find Elijah alive. After the words "cast him," the LXX. has "into the Jordan," which may be authentic. In that case, the disciples may have thought the prophet was hidden somewhere among the reeds and rushes of the river bank, in order to escape some threatened danger. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they said unto him</span>. Thenius suggests that Elisha first related to them what had befallen his master; but the impression left by the narrative is rather that <span class="accented">they</span> began the conversation, being aware of Elijah's disappearance, which in that clear atmosphere they may have distinctly perceived, though the ascension may not have been visible to them. Keil thinks that they saw the ascension, but supposed that the body, after being taken up a certain height into the air, would necessarily fall to earth, and that they wished to find it and bury it. But the natural interpretation is that they thought the prophet had been "caught away" by a Divine influence, as Philip the evangelist was in later times (<a href="/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>), and would be found somewhere alive, as Philip "was found at Azotus." <span class="cmt_word">Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men</span>; literally, sons <span class="accented">of strength</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> stout, active persons, capable of climbing the rough and precipitous rocks among which they thought that Elijah might be east. <span class="cmt_word">Let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.</span> On either side of the <span class="accented">ciccar</span>, or Jordan plain, are rugged districts, consisting of alternate rocky mountain slopes and narrow gulleys, or water-courses, dry during the greater part of the year. The sons of the prophets think that Elijah has been carried by the Spirit of God into one or other of these mountain tracts, and wish to search them. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Ye shall not send</span>; or, <span class="accented">do not send</span>; meaning, "it will be useless - you will find nothing - it is not as you suppose." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/2-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Look</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4994.htm">Strong's 4994: </a> </span><span class="str2">I pray', 'now', 'then'</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
