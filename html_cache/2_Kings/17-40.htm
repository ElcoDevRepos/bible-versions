Throughout the Old Testament, God repeatedly sent prophets to warn His people and call them back to obedience (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>, <a href="/isaiah/30-9.htm">Isaiah 30:9</a>). The Israelites' refusal to listen is a recurring theme, demonstrating their hardened hearts and resistance to God's commands. This disobedience ultimately led to their downfall and exile, as God allowed the Assyrians to conquer the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The phrase underscores the importance of heeding God's word and the consequences of ignoring divine warnings.<p><b>and they persisted in their former customs</b><br>The Israelites' persistence in their former customs refers to their continued practice of idolatry and syncretism, blending the worship of Yahweh with that of other gods. This behavior was explicitly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/5-7.htm">Deuteronomy 5:7-9</a>). The "former customs" likely included the worship of Baal and Asherah, which were prevalent in the region. Archaeological findings, such as altars and idols, support the biblical account of widespread idolatry in ancient Israel. This persistence in idolatry is contrasted with the call to exclusive worship of Yahweh, as seen in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>). The Israelites' failure to abandon these customs ultimately led to their spiritual and national decline, serving as a warning to future generations about the dangers of compromising faith and practice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom of Israel, who were taken into exile by the Assyrians due to their persistent idolatry and disobedience to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrians.htm">Assyrians</a></b><br>The empire that conquered the Northern Kingdom and resettled the land with people from other nations, leading to a syncretistic form of worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom, which became a center of mixed religious practices after the Assyrian conquest.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God who commanded the Israelites to worship Him alone and follow His statutes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Messengers sent by God to warn the Israelites of the consequences of their disobedience and to call them back to faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_syncretism.htm">The Danger of Syncretism</a></b><br>Mixing true worship with pagan practices leads to spiritual compromise and disobedience to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening_to_god.htm">The Importance of Listening to God</a></b><br>Ignoring God's commands and the warnings of His prophets leads to judgment and separation from His blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_stubbornness_of_the_human_heart.htm">The Stubbornness of the Human Heart</a></b><br>Like the Israelites, we are prone to follow our own ways rather than God's, highlighting the need for repentance and submission.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Persistent disobedience results in God's discipline, as seen in the exile of the Northern Kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_exclusive_worship.htm">The Call to Exclusive Worship</a></b><br>God demands our full allegiance and devotion, rejecting any form of idolatry or divided loyalty.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_17_40_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 17:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_17_40_Israel_s_disobedience.htm">How does 2 Kings 17:40 illustrate Israel's persistent disobedience to God's commands?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Israel_s_defiance_in_2_Kings_17_40.htm">What lessons can we learn from Israel's refusal to listen in 2 Kings 17:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Israel_s_actions_vs_Deut_28_warnings.htm">How does Israel's behavior in 2 Kings 17:40 connect to Deuteronomy 28's warnings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_obey_God_s_commands_fully.htm">How can we ensure we don't "listen" but fail to obey God's commands?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Modern_acts_showing_Israel_s_defiance.htm">What modern behaviors reflect Israel's stubbornness in 2 Kings 17:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_ignore_God_s_warnings_in_2_Kings_17_40.htm">Why did the Israelites persist in their former practices despite God's warnings in 2 Kings 17:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_17_40_Disobedience_s_outcome.htm">How does 2 Kings 17:40 reflect the consequences of disobedience to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_led_to_2_Kings_17_40.htm">What historical context led to the events described in 2 Kings 17:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_kings_17.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Kings 17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_christian_nationalism.htm">What is the significance of Ramah in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_god's_goodness_prompt_repentance.htm">Did God command killings in the Old Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/2_kings_17_34-39__why_did_god_reject_israel.htm">2 Kings 17:34-39 -

God had repeatedly warned Israel through Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1&#8211;15</a>) and through prophets like Elijah and Elisha, yet, just as Stephen later lamented, &#8220;You always resist the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>). To &#8220;listen&#8221; in Scripture means more than hearing; it demands obedience (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). By refusing even to hear, the people echoed their fathers in the wilderness who &#8220;would not listen to Me, and they did not remember My Covenant&#8221; (<a href="/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>). The result, as <a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24&#8211;25</a> says, is that calamity necessarily follows rejected counsel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they persisted</b><p>Persistence can be holy&#8212;think of Daniel praying three times a day&#8212;or it can be stubborn rebellion. Here, the word marks a settled, ongoing posture. Like Pharaoh who &#8220;hardened his heart&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15</a>), the northern kingdom stiff-armed every prophetic call to repent. The history recorded in <a href="/bsb/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a> shows God granting time and opportunity: He &#8220;warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13</a>). Yet instead of softening, the nation doubled down. Isaiah described this mindset: &#8220;They have set their faces harder than stone&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/48-4.htm">Isaiah 48:4</a>). Such entrenched resistance turns sin into habit, habit into identity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In their former customs</b><p>The customs in view are the syncretistic practices introduced by Jeroboam I&#8212;golden calves at Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28&#8211;31</a>)&#8212;and later polluted further by Assyrian paganism (<a href="/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29&#8211;33</a>). These rites stood in direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3&#8211;5</a>). Holding on to &#8220;former customs&#8221; means refusing newness of life (<a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>). Even after exile warnings and partial destruction, the people clutched their rituals like idols of the heart (<a href="/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>). Scripture shows that when God&#8217;s people retain old patterns, the consequences are severe: &#8220;If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/66-18.htm">Psalm 66:18</a>). In <a href="/bsb/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a> the outcome is the Assyrian captivity, fulfilling the covenant curses (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/17-40.htm">2 Kings 17:40</a> lays bare a tragic progression: God speaks, His people refuse to listen, they stubbornly continue, and they cling to sinful customs.
