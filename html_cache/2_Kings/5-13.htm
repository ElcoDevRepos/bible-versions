His servants play a crucial role in this narrative, demonstrating the importance of humility and listening to wise counsel, regardless of social status. Servants in ancient Near Eastern cultures often had close relationships with their masters, sometimes acting as advisors. This reflects the biblical theme of God using the humble and lowly to convey His messages, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3</a> with young Samuel.<p><b>&#8220;My father,</b><br>The term "my father" is a respectful and affectionate address, indicating the close relationship between Naaman and his servants. It reflects the cultural practice of using familial terms to express respect and loyalty. This phrase also highlights the humility required to accept guidance from those considered socially inferior, a recurring biblical theme seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a>, which emphasizes the wisdom of heeding advice.<p><b>if the prophet had told you to do some great thing,</b><br>This phrase underscores human nature's tendency to value grand gestures over simple acts. Naaman, a man of valor, might have expected a dramatic or difficult task to match his status. The reference to "the prophet" is to Elisha, who, like other prophets, often delivered God's messages in unexpected ways. This reflects the biblical principle that God's ways are not man's ways, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>.<p><b>would you not have done it?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges Naaman's pride and assumptions, prompting self-reflection. It suggests that Naaman would have been willing to undertake a significant challenge, highlighting the irony that he hesitates at a simple command. This mirrors the biblical theme of faith and obedience, as seen in the story of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac (Genesis 22).<p><b>How much more, then, when he tells you,</b><br>The phrase "how much more" is a common biblical rhetorical device used to emphasize a point by comparison. It invites Naaman to reconsider the simplicity of the prophet's command. This reflects the biblical teaching that God's instructions, though sometimes simple, require faith and trust, as seen in the healing of the blind man in <a href="/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>.<p><b>&#8216;Wash and be cleansed&#8217;?&#8221;</b><br>The command to "wash and be cleansed" is both literal and symbolic. Geographically, the Jordan River, where Naaman was instructed to wash, holds significant biblical importance, being the site of Israel's crossing into the Promised Land (Joshua 3) and later, the baptism of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>). The act of washing symbolizes purification and obedience, prefiguring Christian baptism as a sign of spiritual cleansing and renewal. This reflects the biblical theme of faith leading to healing and salvation, as seen in the story of the ten lepers in <a href="/luke/17-11.htm">Luke 17:11-19</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naaman.htm">Naaman</a></b><br>A commander of the army of the king of Aram, who suffered from leprosy.

Baptism later pictures this same cleansing&#8212;an outward washing that testifies to an inward work of God (<a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>, <a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul captures the principle in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>: &#8220;God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise,&#8221; ensuring the glory is His alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/5-13.htm">2 Kings 5:13</a> exposes pride and elevates humble obedience. Naaman&#8217;s servants lovingly confront their master, remind him that he gladly would have attempted a grand exploit, and urge him to accept the prophet&#8217;s simple prescription. The verse illustrates how God uses ordinary means to display extraordinary grace, calling people away from self-reliance and toward trusting His clear, uncomplicated word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Came near.</span>--Comp. <a href="/genesis/18-23.htm" title="And Abraham drew near, and said, Will you also destroy the righteous with the wicked?">Genesis 18:23</a>.<p><span class= "bld">My father.</span>--A title implying at once respect and affection.

"My father" is a deferential and, at the same time, an affectionate address, not unnatural in the mouth of a confidential servant (comp. <a href="/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>).
