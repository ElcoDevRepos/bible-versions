Jehu, anointed as king of Israel by a prophet sent by Elisha, approaches Jezreel to confront Jezebel. The act of looking up at the window signifies Jehu's direct challenge to Jezebel, who is associated with idolatry and the persecution of prophets. Windows in ancient Near Eastern architecture often served as places of observation and communication, symbolizing a point of confrontation between the old regime and the new.<p><b>&#8220;Who is on my side? Who?&#8221;</b><br>Jehu's question is a call for allegiance and a test of loyalty. It reflects the urgency and decisiveness required in fulfilling God's judgment against the house of Ahab. This moment echoes the broader biblical theme of choosing sides, reminiscent of Joshua's challenge to the Israelites to serve the Lord (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament call to follow Christ, where allegiance to Jesus is paramount (<a href="/matthew/12-30.htm">Matthew 12:30</a>).<p><b>And two or three eunuchs looked down at him.</b><br>Eunuchs, often serving in royal courts, were trusted officials who held significant influence. Their presence at the window indicates their proximity to Jezebel and their potential role in the palace's inner workings. The fact that they respond to Jehu's call suggests a shift in loyalty, highlighting the fulfillment of divine prophecy against Jezebel. This moment underscores the theme of God's sovereignty in using unexpected agents to accomplish His purposes, similar to how God uses unlikely individuals throughout Scripture, such as Rahab (Joshua 2) and the Samaritan woman (John 4).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>Anointed by God as king over Israel, Jehu is tasked with eradicating the house of Ahab and executing divine judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eunuchs.htm">Eunuchs</a></b><br>Servants in the royal court, often entrusted with significant responsibilities.

Windows in Scripture often symbolize exposure or revelation (<a href="/judges/5-28.htm">Judges 5:28</a>; <a href="/acts/20-9.htm">Acts 20:9</a>), and here God is exposing Jezebel&#8217;s vulnerability.<p>&#8226; The action underscores divine appointment: Jehu, freshly anointed, keeps his eyes on the task God assigned, echoing David who &#8220;lifted up his eyes&#8221; to confront Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and called out, &#8220;Who is on my side?

The verse invites today&#8217;s believer to stand openly with God&#8217;s anointed King, Jesus, confident that no power can resist the certainty of Scripture&#8217;s promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">Who is on my side? who?--</span>This hardly implies, as Thenius thinks, that Jezebel had made preparations for resistance. Jehu knew that the imperious and cruel queen was well hated by the palace officials. The "two or three eunuchs," who a moment before had crouched in servile dread before Jezebel, would now be eager to curry favour with the regicide, and, at the same time, wreak their malice upon their former tyrant. (The repetition, "Who is on my side? <span class= "ital">who?</span>" accords well with Jehu's character. The LXX. has the strange reading, "he saw her, and said, Who art thou? Come down with me." Josephus adopts this; but Thenius shows clearly that it has originated in easy corruptions of the present Hebrew text.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who?</span> Whatever Jezebel's intention, Jehu yielded not a jot; he was deaf to her flatteries, blind to her seductions. He had made up his mind for "war to the knife" before he embarked upon his enterprise, and the feeble attempts of a queen whose part was played out, whose age he knew, and whom he no doubt regarded as an old woman, had no power on him. Instead of responding to her blandishments, he took a stern and hard line. He would not see her privately. He summoned to his aid the menials of the palace - the eunuchs -those on whom beauty has least influence. "Who is on my side? <span class="accented">who</span>?" he exclaimed (literally, "Who is with me? who?"); thus calling on the court servants to desert their masters, the guards to turn their swords against their employers, the menials to consummate an intra-palatial revolution. We cannot deny to Jehu the credit of vigor, promptness, audacity, the talent to seize on the opportunity of the moment, and to make the most of it; but he must ever present himself to us as the rough soldier, with no courtesy, with no chivalry, bent on accomplishing his own ends, and shrinking from no deed of blood, no precedent <span class="accented">pessimi exempli</span>, if thereby his ends might be brought about. <span class="cmt_word">And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.</span> Eunuchs had become an integral part both of the Jewish and of the Israelite courts from the time of David (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-1.htm">1 Chronicles 28:1</a>). They are an institution which almost necessarily accompanies polygamy; and they had long held high office in. Egypt, in Babylon, and in Assyria. A position outside nature, at variance with all men's natural feelings and aspirations, of necessity depraves the character, weakens the moral principle, and ends by debasing the class. In Oriental history, the lowest, vilest part is always played by the eunuchs of the palace, who are ever ready to take part in any intrigues, in any conspiracies, and who seem to be almost wholly devoid of the ordinary feelings of humanity. The eunuchs who "looked out" to Jehu were probably the <span class="accented">chief</span> eunuchs of the palace, who had authority over the others, and indeed over the court officials generally. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/9-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He looked up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
