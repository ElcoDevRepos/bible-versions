It demonstrates his humility and recognition of the need for divine guidance. The act of inquiring of the LORD was a common practice in ancient Israel, often involving prophets or priests who would seek God's will. This reflects a theocratic society where decisions were made with divine consultation. Josiah's concern for both himself and his people highlights his role as a leader who prioritizes spiritual reformation and collective responsibility.<p><b>concerning the words in this book that has been found</b><br>The "book" refers to a scroll discovered during temple repairs, likely a portion of Deuteronomy or the entire Pentateuch. This discovery is significant as it suggests a period of neglect of the Law, possibly during the reigns of previous kings who led Judah into idolatry. The rediscovery signifies a pivotal moment of religious revival and reform. The emphasis on "found" indicates the loss and subsequent recovery of God's word, symbolizing spiritual renewal and the importance of scripture in guiding the nation.<p><b>For great is the wrath of the LORD that burns against us</b><br>This acknowledges the seriousness of Judah's situation due to their disobedience. The "wrath of the LORD" is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, representing God's righteous anger against sin and covenant unfaithfulness. It serves as a warning and a call to repentance. The imagery of burning suggests intensity and urgency, emphasizing the need for immediate action to avert divine judgment. This reflects the covenantal relationship where blessings and curses were contingent on obedience to God's commands.<p><b>because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book</b><br>This phrase highlights the generational aspect of sin and disobedience. The reference to "our fathers" indicates a historical pattern of neglecting God's commandments, leading to accumulated guilt and consequences. It underscores the importance of faithfulness across generations and the impact of ancestral actions on current circumstances. This acknowledgment of past failures is a step towards repentance and reform, as it involves recognizing the root causes of divine displeasure.<p><b>by doing all that is written about us</b><br>The emphasis on "doing" underscores the necessity of action in response to God's word. It is not enough to hear or know the law; obedience is required. This reflects the biblical principle that faith is demonstrated through works. The phrase "all that is written" suggests comprehensive adherence to the covenant, not selective obedience. It calls for a holistic approach to living according to God's statutes, which is essential for restoring the relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and sought to restore the worship of Yahweh.

The officers, therefore, understood the king to mean that they were to seek out a prophet (see ver. 14), and so make the inquiry. <span class="cmt_word">And for the people, and for all Judah</span> - the threats read in the king's ears were probably those of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a> or <a href="/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16-39</a>, which extended to the whole people - <span class="cmt_word">concerning the words of this book that is found.</span> Not "whether they are authentic, whether they are really the words of Moses" (Duneker), for of that Josiah appears to have had no doubt; but whether they are words that are to have an immediate fulfillment, "whether," as Yon Gerlach says, "the measure of sin is already full, or whether there is yet hope of grace?" (compare Huldah's answer in vers. 16-20, which shows what she understood the king's inquiry to be). <span class="cmt_word">For great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us.</span> Josiah recognized that Judah had done, and was still doing, exactly those things against which the threatenings of the Law were directed - bad forsaken Jehovah and gone after other gods, and made to themselves high places, and set up images, and done after the customs of the nations whom the Lord had cast out before them.
