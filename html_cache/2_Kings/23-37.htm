The "evil" refers to actions contrary to God's commandments, often involving idolatry and injustice. In the context of 2 Kings, this typically includes the worship of foreign gods and neglect of the covenant with Yahweh. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" underscores God's omniscience and the accountability of leaders to divine standards, not merely human ones. This evaluation is a recurring theme in the books of Kings, highlighting the spiritual decline of Israel and Judah.<p><b>just as his fathers had done</b><br>This phrase connects the actions of the current king to a pattern of behavior established by his predecessors. It suggests a continuity of sin and rebellion against God, often leading to national decline and eventual judgment. The reference to "fathers" implies a generational cycle of disobedience, reflecting the influence of family and cultural traditions in shaping one's actions. This pattern is seen throughout the history of the kings of Israel and Judah, where the failure to break from the sinful practices of ancestors leads to cumulative consequences. Theologically, it underscores the importance of repentance and the need for a righteous leader to break the cycle of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, who reigned after Josiah.

This line tells us that Jehoiakim&#8217;s reign followed the tragic pattern so common in Judah.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently uses &#8220;did evil&#8221; to summarize a king&#8217;s rebellion&#8212;see <a href="/2_kings/21-20.htm">2 Kings 21:20</a> concerning Amon and <a href="/2_chronicles/36-5.htm">2 Chronicles 36:5</a> regarding Jehoiakim himself.<p>&#8226; Evil isn&#8217;t merely bad policy; it is moral and spiritual defiance, including idolatry (<a href="/jeremiah/25-6.htm">Jeremiah 25:6</a>) and oppression of the vulnerable (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that leadership sets a tone for the nation (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>). When the king &#8220;does evil,&#8221; the people are drawn toward the same path (<a href="/2_kings/21-11.htm">2 Kings 21:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the sight of the LORD</b><p>The verse stresses that sin is evaluated &#8220;in the sight of the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God observes and judges, not from a distance but as an active, covenant-keeping Lord (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Human rulers often gauge success by political gains, yet divine assessment pierces those veneers (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; This clause comforts the faithful: injustice and idolatry do not go unnoticed (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>). At the same time, it warns that no amount of royal authority exempts anyone from accountability (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-6.htm">2 Chronicles 19:6&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as his fathers had done</b><p>The closing words link Jehoiakim&#8217;s conduct with the sins of prior generations.<p>&#8226; Repeated references to ancestral patterns (<a href="/2_kings/15-9.htm">2 Kings 15:9</a>; 17:14) underscore how easily sin becomes embedded in a nation&#8217;s culture.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a> notes that iniquity can ripple &#8220;to the third and fourth generation,&#8221; not as fatalistic destiny but as a sober reality when repentance is rejected.<p>&#8226; Yet the record of kings like Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3&#8211;6</a>) and Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/22-2.htm">2 Kings 22:2</a>) shows God&#8217;s eagerness to bless those who break the cycle. Jehoiakim had that same opportunity but chose continuity with rebellion instead.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/23-37.htm">2 Kings 23:37</a> offers a concise verdict on Jehoiakim: he embraced the longstanding rebellion of Judah&#8217;s earlier kings, committing moral and spiritual evil observed by the all-seeing LORD. The verse reminds us that leadership carries grave responsibility, God&#8217;s assessment outweighs human applause, and generational patterns of sin can be broken only through wholehearted return to the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done.</span> Jeremiah says of Jehoiakim, "Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbor's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work; that saith, I will build me a large house and wide chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is coiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion. Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him? He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? saith the Lord. But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it" (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13-17</a>). Josephus calls him "an unjust man and an evil-doer, neither pious in his relations towards God nor equitable in his dealings with his fellow men" ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:5. &sect; 2). His execution of Urijah, the son of Shemalah, for prophesying the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20-23</a>), was an act at once of cruelty and impiety. It is suspected (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 252) that, besides reintroducing into Judah all the foreign rites extirpated by his father, he added Egyptian rites to their number. The tyranny which he practiced was likewise of an Egyptian cast, including, as it did, the exaction of forced labor from his subjects (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>), an old custom of the Pharaohs, and it is quite possible that his "passion for building splendid and costly houses" (Ewald) was awakened by his knowledge of the magnificence which characterized the monarchs of the Saitic dynasty, who revived in Egypt the architectural glories of the Ramessides (see Herod., 2:153, 175, 176). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/23-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
