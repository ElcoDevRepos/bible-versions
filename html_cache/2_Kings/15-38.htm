The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a peaceful passing and a joining with ancestors. It reflects the belief in an afterlife and the continuation of one's lineage. Jotham's reign was marked by relative stability and faithfulness to God, as noted in <a href="/2_kings/15-34.htm">2 Kings 15:34</a>, where he is described as doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord.<p><b>and was buried with them in the City of David his father.</b><br>The City of David refers to Jerusalem, specifically the area that was the original stronghold captured by King David. Being buried in the City of David was an honor, signifying Jotham's legitimate and respected place in the Davidic line. This burial location underscores the importance of the Davidic covenant, which promised that David's descendants would continue to rule. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of royal tombs in this area, though specific identifications remain debated.<p><b>And his son Ahaz reigned in his place.</b><br>Ahaz's succession to the throne marks a significant transition. Unlike his father, Ahaz is noted for his unfaithfulness to God, as detailed in <a href="/2_kings/16.htm">2 Kings 16</a>. His reign is characterized by idolatry and political alliances that compromised Judah's spiritual integrity. This transition highlights the recurring biblical theme of the faithfulness of one generation not guaranteeing the same in the next. Ahaz's reign sets the stage for the prophetic ministry of Isaiah, who warned against the very alliances Ahaz pursued.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rezin.htm">Rezin</a></b><br>King of Aram (Syria) who was an adversary of Judah.

This line reminds us:<p>&#8226; God keeps His promise to David of an enduring dynasty (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Honor accompanies obedience&#8212;Jotham&#8217;s righteous reign earns him a place among the honored dead (<a href="/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The location foreshadows the greater Son of David, Jesus, who will also be buried&#8212;and rise&#8212;in Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/23-53.htm">Luke 23:53-24</a>:6).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his son Ahaz reigned in his place.</b><p>Transition is immediate.
