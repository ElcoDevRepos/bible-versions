The Assyrians were known for their military prowess and had conquered many nations, each with its own deities. The rhetorical question highlights the Assyrian belief in their superiority and the impotence of other gods. Historically, the Assyrians had indeed defeated many nations, which would have included the destruction of their religious symbols and temples, reinforcing their claim. This statement also reflects the common ancient Near Eastern belief in the power of national gods, where the defeat of a nation was seen as the defeat of its deity. Theologically, this sets the stage for a demonstration of the LORD's unique power, contrasting the living God of Israel with the idols of other nations.<p><b>How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?&#8221;</b><br>This challenge directly questions the power of the God of Israel, Yahweh, to save Jerusalem from the Assyrian threat. The Rabshakeh's taunt is not just against Hezekiah but against the LORD Himself, implying that Yahweh is no different from the powerless gods of other nations. This reflects a misunderstanding or underestimation of the God of Israel, who is not limited by geography or political power. Biblically, this sets up a narrative tension that is resolved in the subsequent chapters, where God indeed delivers Jerusalem miraculously (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35-37</a>). This event is a testament to God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His covenant with Israel. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of God's promises and the true deliverer of His people. Theologically, this passage challenges believers to trust in God's power and faithfulness, even when circumstances seem insurmountable.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to reform the religious practices of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The king of Assyria, who invaded Judah and laid siege to Jerusalem, challenging the power of the God of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, under threat from the Assyrian army, representing the spiritual and political heart of the Jewish people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrian_siege.htm">Assyrian Siege</a></b><br>The military campaign led by Sennacherib against Judah, testing the faith and resilience of Hezekiah and his people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whose power and sovereignty are being challenged by Sennacherib's taunts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Hezekiah's faith in God amidst overwhelming odds teaches us to trust in God's ultimate control over all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Sennacherib's taunt highlights the impotence of false gods, reminding us to place our faith solely in the one true God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Promises</a></b><br>God's deliverance of Jerusalem demonstrates His faithfulness to His covenant people, encouraging us to rely on His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_as_a_response_to_crisis.htm">Prayer as a Response to Crisis</a></b><br>Hezekiah's response to the Assyrian threat was to seek God in prayer, modeling for us the importance of turning to God in times of trouble.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_glory_in_deliverance.htm">God's Glory in Deliverance</a></b><br>The deliverance of Jerusalem was not just for the sake of the city but to demonstrate God's power and glory to the nations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_18_35_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 18:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_18_35_Trust_God_not_powers.htm">How does 2 Kings 18:35 challenge our trust in worldly powers over God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_18_35_on_God_s_supremacy.htm">What does 2 Kings 18:35 reveal about God's supremacy over other gods?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_2_Kings_18_35_daily.htm">How can we apply the lesson of 2 Kings 18:35 in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Scriptures_showing_God_s_supreme_power.htm">What scriptural connections reinforce God's unmatched power as seen in 2 Kings 18:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_18_35_Trust_God_in_challenges.htm">How does 2 Kings 18:35 encourage reliance on God during life's challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_18_35_God_s_power_questioned.htm">How does 2 Kings 18:35 challenge the belief in God's power over other gods?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_2_Kings_18_35_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in 2 Kings 18:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_18_35_Divine_protection_theme.htm">How does 2 Kings 18:35 reflect the theme of divine protection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_kings_18.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Kings 18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/key_events_in_hezekiah's_reign.htm">What events define Hezekiah's reign as king?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_was_dathan_in_the_bible.htm">Who was Sennacherib in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_to_verify_hezekiah's_unique_devotion.htm">2 Kings 18:5-6 -
