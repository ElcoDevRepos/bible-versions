The mention of "his servants" indicates a betrayal from within his own ranks, highlighting the instability and internal strife within the kingdom. Jozabad and Jehozabad, the assassins, are identified by their lineage, which was a common biblical practice to establish identity and heritage. The act of striking down a king by his own servants reflects the fulfillment of divine judgment, as Joash had turned away from God after the death of Jehoiada the priest (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17-22</a>). This event underscores the biblical theme of divine retribution for unfaithfulness.<p><b>And they buried him with his fathers in the City of David,</b><br>The burial "with his fathers" signifies that Joash was laid to rest in the royal tombs, a place of honor reserved for the kings of Judah. The "City of David" refers to Jerusalem, specifically the area known as the original stronghold of King David. This burial location indicates that despite his assassination, Joash was still recognized as a legitimate king of Judah. The City of David holds significant historical and archaeological importance, as it is the ancient core of Jerusalem, with ongoing excavations revealing insights into the period of the united monarchy.<p><b>and his son Amaziah reigned in his place.</b><br>Amaziah's succession to the throne marks the continuation of the Davidic line, which is a central theme in the biblical narrative. The Davidic covenant, as outlined in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, promised that David's descendants would continue to rule. Amaziah's reign is a fulfillment of this promise, despite the turmoil and sin that characterized his father's rule. This transition of power also sets the stage for future events in the history of Judah, as Amaziah's reign is detailed in the subsequent chapters of 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles. The continuity of the Davidic line is significant in Christian theology, as it ultimately leads to the birth of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Son of David" (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>King of Judah who initially did what was right in the eyes of the Lord under the guidance of Jehoiada the priest but later turned away from God, leading to his assassination.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/beth-millo.htm">Beth-millo</a></b><br>A location in Jerusalem where Joash was assassinated.

"the two statements are not irreconcilable," since he may have been regarded as "buried with his fathers," if his grave was anywhere in Jerusalem, even though he was excluded from the royal burying-place. <span class="cmt_word">And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.</span> (For the reign of Amaziah, see <a href="/2_kings/14-1.htm">2 Kings 14:1-20</a>.) <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/12-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">His servants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
