The "commanders of hundreds" were military leaders responsible for executing Jehoiada's plan. This phrase highlights the obedience and respect the military had for Jehoiada, indicating his influence and authority. The cooperation between religious and military leaders was essential for the success of this plan, reflecting the theocratic nature of Israelite society where religious leaders often held significant sway over political and military matters.<p><b>Each of them took his men&#8212;those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty&#8212;</b><br>The reference to the Sabbath indicates the strategic timing of Jehoiada's plan. The changing of the guard on the Sabbath would have been a routine event, allowing for a seamless transition of forces without arousing suspicion. This clever use of timing ensured that there were enough loyal soldiers present to protect Joash and execute the coup against Athaliah. The Sabbath, a day of rest and worship, also underscores the religious significance of the event, as it was a day dedicated to the Lord, aligning the coup with divine approval.<p><b>and came to Jehoiada the priest.</b><br>The commanders and their men coming to Jehoiada signifies their allegiance and trust in his leadership. Jehoiada's role as a priest underscores the religious legitimacy of the coup. By gathering at the temple, the center of religious life, the event is framed as not just a political maneuver but a divinely sanctioned act. This gathering at the temple also foreshadows the anointing and crowning of Joash, which would take place in a sacred setting, emphasizing the restoration of the Davidic line as a fulfillment of God's

responsible for one-hundred-man units. In a kingdom thrown into chaos by Athaliah&#8217;s murderous coup (<a href="/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1&#8211;3</a>), their willingness to follow Jehoiada marks a decisive shift. Scripture frequently links godly reforms to courageous leaders rallying behind righteous authority (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34&#8211;35</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-52.htm">1 Samuel 14:52</a>). Here, these commanders stand as instruments through whom the Lord preserves David&#8217;s line, fulfilling the covenant promise of <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>did everything that Jehoiada the priest had ordered</b><p>Obedience is complete, not partial. Jehoiada, as high priest, represents both spiritual and, in this moment, practical leadership. Similar scenes appear when God&#8217;s people &#8220;did everything Moses commanded&#8221; in building the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/39-42.htm">Exodus 39:42</a>) or when the returned exiles &#8220;did according to the word&#8221; of Ezra (<a href="/ezra/10-5.htm">Ezra 10:5</a>). Their thorough compliance shows trust in God&#8217;s plan and highlights that true reform depends on aligning actions with divine instruction (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Each of them took his men&#8212;those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty</b><p>Jehoiada cleverly employs the regular priestly and guard rotations (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-25.htm">1 Chronicles 9:25</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4&#8211;8</a>) to assemble a double shift without arousing suspicion. What looks like military logistics is, in fact, God&#8217;s providence using ordinary routines for extraordinary deliverance (<a href="/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1&#8211;11</a>). The Sabbath mention reminds us that God&#8217;s works of salvation and protection often unfold even on His holy day (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27&#8211;28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and came to Jehoiada the priest</b><p>Instead of reporting to the palace, the troops gather around the priest within the temple precincts, signaling a transfer of allegiance from a wicked usurper to God&#8217;s ordained leadership. Like the tribes gathering to David at Hebron (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>), their convergence underscores Israel&#8217;s covenant identity: the king must be installed under the authority of the priesthood and before the LORD (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>). The temple becomes the staging ground for covenant faithfulness and national renewal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/11-9.htm">2 Kings 11:9</a> records the obedient, coordinated response of military leaders to Jehoiada&#8217;s god-directed plan, revealing how God safeguards the Davidic line through willing servants. Their complete compliance, strategic use of Sabbath guard rotations, and assembly around the priest demonstrate that when God&#8217;s people heed righteous leadership, He orchestrates even routine details to accomplish His covenant purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9, 10) The preparations for carrying out the above arrangements.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">The captains over the hundreds</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the centurions of the royal guard (<a href="/2_kings/11-4.htm" title="And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son.">2Kings 11:4</a>).

When it is said that "<span class="accented">all</span> the captains took their men and came to Jehoiada," the intention is to mark their exact obedience to the orders given them. Strictly speaking, only two out of the five actually appeared before Jehoiada on the day of the execution of his project, two divisions only having been summoned to come to the temple (ver. 7).
