These locations were prevalent in ancient Israel and Judah, despite God's command to worship exclusively at the temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-5</a>). The persistence of high places indicates a failure to fully adhere to God's instructions, reflecting a recurring theme of incomplete obedience among the kings of Israel and Judah. This phrase highlights the tension between centralized worship in Jerusalem and local religious practices. The failure to remove high places is a common critique of many kings, including those who were otherwise considered righteous, such as Asa and Jehoshaphat (<a href="/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>; 22:43).<p><b>the people continued sacrificing and burning incense there.</b><br>Sacrificing and burning incense were central acts of worship in ancient Israel, intended to honor God and seek His favor. However, when performed at unauthorized sites, these acts were considered idolatrous or syncretistic, blending the worship of Yahweh with pagan practices. This behavior reflects the people's attachment to traditional local worship sites and their resistance to religious reforms. The persistence of these practices underscores the challenge of leading the nation back to exclusive worship of Yahweh. It also foreshadows the eventual downfall of both Israel and Judah, as their continued idolatry leads to divine judgment (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-10.htm">2 Kings 21:10-15</a>).

Verses 1&#8211;2 celebrate that &#8220;Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the days he was instructed by Jehoiada the priest.&#8221; Nevertheless signals that something significant was left unfinished.<p>- Scripture often layers commendation with a sober &#8220;nevertheless&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4</a>). It reminds us that partial obedience, even in a largely faithful life, still matters to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the high places were not removed</b><p>- High places were unauthorized worship sites scattered across Judah. God had already commanded, &#8220;Tear down their altars, smash their sacred stones&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>- Leaving them standing preserved a foothold for compromise. Centuries later Hezekiah&#8217;s reform would succeed where Joash faltered: &#8220;He removed the high places, smashed the sacred stones&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>).<p>- The verse shows that good leadership must be thorough; half-measures leave room for future sin (<a href="/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>; 15:4).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people continued sacrificing</b><p>- Worship continued, but at the wrong location. God had centralized sacrifice at the Jerusalem temple (<a href="/leviticus/17-3.htm">Leviticus 17:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>- Activity does not equal obedience. Samuel told Saul, &#8220;To obey is better than sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>- The people followed tradition instead of revelation, a pattern Isaiah later rebuked: &#8220;These people draw near with their mouths &#8230; yet their hearts are far from Me&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and burning incense there</b><p>- Incense symbolized prayer rising to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>). Burning it elsewhere blurred the line between true worship and pagan ritual (<a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>).<p>- God specified where incense belonged: &#8220;Aaron shall burn fragrant incense on it every morning&#8221; at the golden altar in the sanctuary (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>- The people&#8217;s well-intended devotion became disobedient practice, illustrating how sincerity cannot cancel out clear commands (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/12-3.htm">2 Kings 12:3</a> teaches that even a righteous king like Joash left pockets of compromise. High places survived, and the people kept old habits. God values wholehearted, not partial, obedience.
