Gehazi's role as a servant of the "man of God" indicates his close association with Elisha, who succeeded Elijah as a prophet in Israel. This context highlights the importance of prophets in Israelite society, serving as intermediaries between God and the people. Gehazi's presence in the king's court suggests a level of influence or at least recognition of Elisha's prophetic authority. Historically, prophets often played crucial roles in advising and guiding kings, as seen with Nathan and David or Isaiah and Hezekiah.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Please relate to me all the great things Elisha has done.&#8221;</b><br>The king's request for Gehazi to recount Elisha's deeds underscores the widespread recognition of Elisha's miraculous works and divine authority. This request reflects a curiosity or perhaps a need for reassurance of divine presence and power in the kingdom. Elisha's miracles, such as raising the Shunammite's son (<a href="/2_kings/4-32.htm">2 Kings 4:32-37</a>) and healing Naaman the leper (<a href="/2_kings/5.htm">2 Kings 5:1-14</a>), demonstrate God's intervention in human affairs and serve as types of Christ's own miracles, foreshadowing the New Testament accounts of Jesus' healing and resurrection power. The king's interest may also indicate a political motive, seeking to understand the influence of Elisha among the people. This moment connects to the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the role of His prophets in executing His will on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>Likely King Jehoram, who was interested in the miraculous works of Elisha, the prophet.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gehazi.htm">Gehazi</a></b><br>The servant of Elisha, who had previously been struck with leprosy for his greed (<a href="/2_kings/5-27.htm">2 Kings 5:27</a>), yet here he is speaking with the king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>The prophet of God, known for performing many miracles and being a powerful voice for God in Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracles_of_elisha.htm">The Miracles of Elisha</a></b><br>The context involves recounting the miraculous acts performed by Elisha, which were significant enough to capture the king's interest.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_testimony.htm">The Power of Testimony</a></b><br>Sharing the works of God can inspire faith and curiosity in others, as seen in the king's interest in Elisha's miracles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_grace_and_redemption.htm">God's Grace and Redemption</a></b><br>Despite Gehazi's past sins, he is still used in a position to testify about God's works, illustrating God's grace and the possibility of redemption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_influence_of_godly_lives.htm">The Influence of Godly Lives</a></b><br>Elisha's life and actions had a profound impact, reaching even the king.

And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.">2Kings 5:27</a>). So Keil and some earlier expositors. But lepers, though excluded from the city, were not excluded from <span class= "ital">conversation</span> with others. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/8-2.htm" title="And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.">Matthew 8:2</a>; <a href="/luke/17-12.htm" title="And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:">Luke 17:12</a>.)

The way, however, in which Gehazi is spoken of as "the servant of the man of God" (comp. <a href="/2_kings/5-20.htm" title="But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD lives, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.">2Kings 5:20</a>) seems to imply the priority of the present narrative to that of 2 Kings 5. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king talked with Gehazi</span>; rather, <span class="accented">now the king was talking with Gehazi</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in the Revised Version. The king, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, happened to be talking with Gehazi at the moment when the woman came into his presence and "cried" to him. It has been reasonably concluded from this, that chronological order is not observed in the portion of the narrative which treats of Elisha and his doings, since a king of Israel would scarcely be in familiar conversation with a leper (Keil). It may be added that Gehazi can scarcely have continued to be the servant of Elisha, as he evidently now was, after his leprosy. He must have dwelt "without the gate." <span class="cmt_word">The servant of the man of God.</span> That a king should converse with a servant is, no doubt, somewhat unusual; but, as Bahr notes, there is nothing in the circumstance that need astonish us. It is natural enough that, having been himself a witness of so many of the prophet's marvelous acts done in public, Jehoram should become curious concerning those other marvelous acts which he had performed in private, among his personal friends and associates, with respect to which many turnouts must have got abroad; and should wish to obtain an account of them from a source on which he could rely. If he had this desire, he could scarcely apply to the prophet himself, with whom he was at no time on familiar terms, and who would shrink from enlarging on his own miraculous powers. "To whom, then, could he apply with more propriety for this information than to the prophet's familiar servant" - an eye-witness of most of them, and one who would have no reason for reticence? Oriental ideas would not be shocked by the king's sending for any subject from whom he desired information, and questioning him. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.</span> Miracles are often called "great things" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>) in the Old Testament, but generally in connection with God as the doer of them (see <a href="/job/5-9.htm">Job 5:9</a>;
