Isaiah was a major prophet in Judah during the reigns of several kings, including Hezekiah. His role as a prophet was to convey God's messages to the people and their leaders. Isaiah's response is significant as it provides divine guidance and reassurance during a time of crisis.<p><b>&#8220;Tell your master that this is what the LORD says:</b><br>The phrase indicates a direct message from God, emphasizing the authority and divine origin of the words that follow. In the context of ancient Israel, prophets were seen as God's mouthpieces, and their messages were considered binding and authoritative. This introduction underscores the importance of the message and the need for Hezekiah to heed it.<p><b>&#8216;Do not be afraid of the words you have heard,</b><br>Fear is a common human response to threats, and the Assyrian army was a formidable force known for its brutality and military prowess. The command not to fear is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with God's presence and protection (e.g., <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). This reassurance is meant to strengthen Hezekiah's faith and resolve in the face of overwhelming odds.<p><b>with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.</b><br>The Assyrian officials, representing King Sennacherib, had mocked the God of Israel, equating Him with the powerless gods of other nations they had conquered. This blasphemy was not just an insult to Israel but a direct challenge to God's sovereignty and power. The term "blasphemed" indicates a serious offense against God, highlighting the spiritual dimension of the conflict. This situation foreshadows the ultimate vindication of God's name and power, a theme that resonates throughout the Bible, culminating in the victory of Christ over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is known for his prophecies concerning the coming of the Messiah and the salvation of the Lord.
