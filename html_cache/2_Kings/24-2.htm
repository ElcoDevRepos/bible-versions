The Chaldeans, also known as Babylonians, were a rising power under Nebuchadnezzar. The Arameans, Moabites, and Ammonites were neighboring nations often in conflict with Israel. This coalition of raiders signifies God's judgment on Judah for its persistent idolatry and disobedience. Historically, these groups were known for their military campaigns and raids, which were common in the ancient Near East. The involvement of these specific nations underscores the comprehensive nature of the threat against Judah.<p><b>in order to destroy Judah</b><br>The destruction of Judah was a fulfillment of divine judgment due to the nation's repeated sins, including idolatry and injustice. This phrase indicates the severity of the consequences of turning away from God. The destruction was not merely a political or military event but a spiritual reckoning.
