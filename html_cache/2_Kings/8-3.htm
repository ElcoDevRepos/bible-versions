The number seven often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in the Bible, as seen in the creation week (Genesis 1) and the seven churches in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). This period of famine was a divine judgment and a test of faith for the people of Israel.<p><b>when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines</b><br>The woman is the Shunammite whose son Elisha had previously raised from the dead (<a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8-37</a>). Her return from the land of the Philistines, a region often at odds with Israel, signifies a journey from a place of exile back to her homeland. The Philistines were a significant presence in the coastal regions of Canaan, and their interactions with Israel were marked by conflict and cultural exchange. Her return can be seen as a type of restoration, akin to the Israelites' return from Babylonian exile.<p><b>she went to the king</b><br>Approaching the king indicates the woman's boldness and faith. In ancient Israel, the king was the highest authority, and seeking his intervention was a significant step. This action reflects the biblical principle of seeking justice and the role of the king as a judge (<a href="/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16-28</a>). It also foreshadows the believer's access to the King of Kings through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p><b>to appeal for her house and her land</b><br>The appeal for her property highlights the importance of land inheritance in Israelite society, which was tied to family identity and God's covenant promises (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>). The loss and restoration of land can symbolize spiritual restoration and the reclaiming of God's promises. This act of appealing to the king for justice parallels the believer's appeal to God for restoration and redemption through Christ, who is our advocate (1 <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>This is the Shunammite woman who had previously shown hospitality to the prophet Elisha.

The Lord who permits adversity also decrees its finish, underscoring His sovereign control and covenant faithfulness (<a href="/leviticus/26-42.htm">Leviticus 26:42</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience sustained the woman through the entire period, echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a> where God uses famine to teach dependence on His word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines</b><p>Her return shows prompt trust in God&#8217;s timing.<p>&#8226; She had lived among the Philistines, historical enemies of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-20</a>), yet God preserved her family there, much like He sheltered Isaac in Philistine territory during another famine (<a href="/genesis/26-1.htm">Genesis 26:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;returned&#8221; links to <a href="/ruth/1-6.htm">Ruth 1:6</a>, where Naomi came back when &#8220;the LORD had attended to His people.&#8221; In both accounts, God ends famine and brings the faithful home with renewed hope.<p>&#8226; Journeying home parallels <a href="/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a>&#8212;&#8220;The LORD will watch over your coming and going&#8221;&#8212;a promise literally experienced by this woman.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she went to the king</b><p>Stepping into the royal court illustrates respectful use of legitimate authority.<p>&#8226; Joram (or Jehoram) ruled Israel at the time (<a href="/2_kings/8-16.htm">2 Kings 8:16</a>).

Now she herself acts, indicating growth in faith and initiative.<p>&#8226; Her bold approach parallels <a href="/esther/5-1.htm">Esther 5:1-2</a> and the principle of <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>&#8212;believers may confidently seek help where ultimate authority lies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to appeal for her house and her land</b><p>During her absence, others had evidently occupied or claimed her property.<p>&#8226; The Law provided for land redemption after hardship (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>); her appeal stood on those legal foundations.<p>&#8226; God orchestrated perfect timing: while she spoke, Gehazi was recounting to the king Elisha&#8217;s earlier miracle for her son (<a href="/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4-5</a>). The testimony authenticated her story and moved the king to restore &#8220;all that was hers, plus all the revenue from the land from the day she left&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/8-6.htm">2 Kings 8:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene contrasts sharply with Ahab&#8217;s theft of Naboth&#8217;s vineyard (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a>). Where unrighteous kings steal, God ensures this king restores, embodying <a href="/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>&#8212;&#8220;The LORD upholds the widow and the fatherless.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Her case also foreshadows <a href="/luke/18-3.htm">Luke 18:3-7</a>, where a persistent widow receives justice from a judge; how much more will God secure justice for His own.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/8-3.htm">2 Kings 8:3</a> showcases God&#8217;s meticulous governance over time, place, and authority. A woman who obeyed a prophetic word endured a divinely limited famine, safely sojourned among enemies, and returned exactly when God had arranged her vindication. By appealing respectfully to the king, she witnessed the Lord direct secular power to restore everything she lost. The verse teaches that those who trust and obey can rest in God&#8217;s sovereign timing and unfailing commitment to preserve both their lives and their rightful inheritance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">At the seven years' end.</span>--Omit <span class= "ital">the.</span><p><span class= "bld">She went forth.</span>--From Shunem to Samaria.<p><span class= "bld">For her house and for her land.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">with regard to her house,</span> &c.
