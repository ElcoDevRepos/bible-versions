The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a peaceful transition and continuity with the ancestors. Azariah's reign was marked by both prosperity and divine judgment, as he was struck with leprosy for his pride (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>). His death signifies the end of an era and the transition to a new leadership under his son.<p><b>and was buried near them in the City of David.</b><br>The City of David refers to the ancient core of Jerusalem, where the kings of Judah were traditionally buried. This burial location underscores Azariah's royal status and his connection to the Davidic line, which is significant in biblical prophecy concerning the Messiah (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The mention of being buried "near them" may imply that due to his leprosy, he was not buried in the royal tombs, reflecting the consequences of his sin even in death.<p><b>And his son Jotham reigned in his place.</b><br>Jotham's ascension to the throne marks the continuation of the Davidic dynasty. Jotham is noted for his righteous reign, as he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord (<a href="/2_kings/15-34.htm">2 Kings 15:34</a>). His rule is characterized by stability and fortification efforts, as recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3-6</a>. Jotham's reign serves as a type of Christ in his role as a just and righteous king, prefiguring the ultimate reign of Jesus, the descendant of David, who will establish an everlasting kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah.htm">Azariah (Uzziah)</a></b><br>Also known as Uzziah, he was a king of Judah who reigned for 52 years.
