The "high places" were elevated sites often used for worship, both for Yahweh and for pagan deities. These locations were typically chosen for their height, symbolizing closeness to the divine. Despite God's command to worship only in the temple in Jerusalem, many Israelites continued to use these sites, which were often associated with Canaanite religious practices. This disobedience reflects a recurring theme in Israel's history, where the people turned away from exclusive worship of Yahweh, leading to spiritual decline and eventual judgment.<p><b>on the hills</b><br>The mention of "hills" emphasizes the widespread nature of Ahaz's idolatry. Hills were commonly used for pagan worship due to their prominence in the landscape, making them visible and accessible. This practice was contrary to the centralized worship God had established in Jerusalem. The use of hills for worship is condemned in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>, where God commands the destruction of these sites. Ahaz's actions demonstrate a deliberate rejection of God's instructions and a preference for the religious customs of surrounding nations.<p><b>and under every green tree</b><br>The phrase "under every green tree" indicates the pervasiveness and accessibility of idol worship during Ahaz's reign. Green trees, often associated with fertility and life, were used as sites for pagan rituals, including those dedicated to Asherah, a Canaanite goddess. This imagery is used throughout the Old Testament to describe idolatrous practices (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>). The use of trees in worship highlights the blending of Canaanite religious elements with Israelite practices, which was strictly forbidden by God. This syncretism led to moral and spiritual corruption, distancing the people from their covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his idolatrous practices and departure from the ways of his forefathers who followed the Lord.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places.htm">High Places</a></b><br>Elevated sites often used for idol worship and pagan rituals, contrary to the worship of Yahweh in the temple at Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hills_and_green_trees.htm">Hills and Green Trees</a></b><br>Common locations for pagan worship in ancient Near Eastern cultures, symbolizing fertility and life but used here in the context of idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was supposed to be a beacon of faithfulness to Yahweh but was led astray by its king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The worship of idols or false gods, which was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law and led to spiritual and moral decline.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Ahaz's actions demonstrate how compromising with pagan practices leads to spiritual decline.

Instead of worshiping at God-ordained altars, Ahaz &#8220;sacrificed and burned incense,&#8221; actions reserved for priests at the temple (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-18.htm">2 Chronicles 26:18</a>).<p>&#8226; By taking these acts into his own hands, Ahaz ignored clear commands that limited sacrificial service to the Levitical priesthood (<a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This self-directed worship paralleled the sins of Israel&#8217;s kings before him (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31&#8211;33</a>; 15:13). It displays how personal convenience and cultural influence can replace obedience when a leader&#8217;s heart drifts from the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the high places</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;High places&#8221; were elevated sites originally commandeered for pagan rites (<a href="/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>). God had ordered Israel to destroy them (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2&#8211;3</a>), yet they lingered through much of the nation&#8217;s history (<a href="/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>; 15:4).<p>&#8226; Worshiping here mixed elements of Canaanite religion with Israel&#8217;s, blurring lines God had drawn sharply (<a href="/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; High places appealed because they offered:<p>&#8211; proximity: often close to home, unlike the single temple in Jerusalem.<p>&#8211; anonymity: individualistic worship with less accountability.<p>&#8211; sensual practices: rituals that gratified fleshly desires (<a href="/2_kings/17-11.htm">2 Kings 17:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Ahaz&#8217;s use of them shows willful rebellion, not ignorance; the temple stood intact in his own capital (<a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the hills</b><p>&#8226; Moving from man-made sanctuaries to natural elevations, Ahaz broadened illicit worship to any convenient ridge or slope.<p>&#8226; Hills were symbolic vantage points&#8212;people assumed they were closer to heaven, yet Scripture calls such confidence misplaced (<a href="/jeremiah/3-23.htm">Jeremiah 3:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; The progression from high places to hills highlights how sin spreads: what begins in set locations soon saturates everyday life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and under every green tree</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Every green tree&#8221; paints an image of unrestrained idolatry.

Each phrase traces an expanding sphere of rebellion: personal defiance, public corruption, and pervasive cultural decay. The verse warns that when God&#8217;s people ignore His clear instructions, compromise multiplies, holiness erodes, and the land becomes saturated with false worship.
