The use of "spoke" indicates a direct and intentional communication from God, highlighting His active involvement in the affairs of Israel. This reflects the consistent biblical theme that God is not silent but reveals His will and purposes to humanity.<p><b>through His servants the prophets,</b><br>Prophets in the Old Testament served as God's messengers, chosen to deliver His words to the people. They were often called to speak during times of national crisis or moral decline, as seen in the context of <a href="/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21</a>, where King Manasseh's reign is marked by idolatry and apostasy. The term "servants" underscores their role as obedient and faithful messengers, dedicated to fulfilling God's commands. Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others were instrumental in guiding, warning, and sometimes rebuking the nation of Israel. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative where prophets are seen as forerunners to Christ, the ultimate Prophet, who perfectly reveals God's will.<p><b>saying,</b><br>This introduces the specific message that follows, indicating that what is to be said is not the prophet's own words but a direct revelation from God. The use of "saying" sets the stage for the prophetic message, which often includes calls to repentance, warnings of judgment, or promises of future hope. In the context of <a href="/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21</a>, the message is likely one of impending judgment due to the nation's unfaithfulness, aligning with the broader biblical theme of God's justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who communicates His will and judgment through His prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_the_prophets.htm">Servants the Prophets</a></b><br>God's chosen messengers who convey His words to the people.
