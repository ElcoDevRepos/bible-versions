The precision of the date underscores the importance of the event, as it is recorded in the Babylonian calendar. The twelfth month corresponds to the month of Adar in the Hebrew calendar, which is around February-March in the Gregorian calendar. This timing is significant as it marks the end of the Babylonian year, a time often associated with new beginnings and changes.<p><b>of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Judah&#8217;s King Jehoiachin</b><br>Jehoiachin's exile began in 597 BC when he was taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon. The thirty-seventh year of his exile would place this event around 560 BC. Jehoiachin's long imprisonment symbolizes the enduring consequences of Judah's disobedience to God. His release after such a lengthy period highlights themes of hope and restoration, even after prolonged judgment.<p><b>in the year Evil-merodach became king of Babylon</b><br>Evil-merodach, also known as Amel-Marduk, was the son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar II. His reign began in 562 BC and lasted until 560 BC. His ascension to the throne marked a shift in Babylonian policy, as he is noted for his more lenient treatment of captives, including Jehoiachin. This change in leadership and policy can be seen as part of God's providential plan, allowing for the eventual return of the exiles to Judah.<p><b>he released King Jehoiachin of Judah from prison</b><br>The release of Jehoiachin is a pivotal moment, symbolizing a glimmer of hope for the exiled people of Judah. It prefigures the eventual return of the Jewish people to their homeland, as prophesied by Jeremiah and other prophets. Jehoiachin's release can also be seen as a type of Christ, who liberates humanity from the bondage of sin.

He therefore mentions, as his last incident, the fate of Jehoiachin, who, after thirty-six years of a cruel and seemingly hopeless imprisonment, experienced a happy change of circumstances. The king who succeeded Nebuchadnezzar, his son, Evil-Merodach, in the first year of his sovereignty had compassion upon the miserable captive, and releasing him from prison, changed his garments (ver. 29), and gave him a place at his table, among other dethroned monarchs, even exalting him above the rest (ver. 28), and making him an allowance for his support (ver. 30). This alleviation of their king's condition could not but be felt by the captive Jews as a happy omen - a portent of the time when their lot too would be alleviated, and the Almighty Disposer of events, having punished them sufficiently for their sins, would relent at last, and put an end to their banishment, and give them rest and peace in their native country. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin King of Judah.</span> According to Berosus and the Canon of Ptolemy, Nebuchadnezzar reigned forty-four years.
