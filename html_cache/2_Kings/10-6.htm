His correspondence with the leaders of Samaria shows his strategic approach to consolidating power. Writing a second letter indicates persistence and determination in his mission. This reflects the seriousness of his intent to fulfill the prophecy given by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-22</a>).<p><b>&#8220;If you are on my side, and if you will obey me,</b><br>Jehu demands loyalty from the leaders of Samaria.

This call for obedience echoes the biblical theme of choosing whom to serve, reminiscent of Joshua's challenge to Israel (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p><b>then bring the heads of your master&#8217;s sons to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow.&#8221;</b><br>Jehu's command is brutal, reflecting the harsh realities of ancient Near Eastern politics and warfare.

Jezreel, a significant location in Israel's history, was where Jehu was anointed king and where Jezebel met her end. This act of violence is a stark reminder of the consequences of idolatry and rebellion against God.<p><b>Now the sons of the king, seventy in all,</b><br>The large number of Ahab's sons indicates the extensive reach and influence of Ahab's dynasty.

According to the Masoretic punctuation, and supposing that the particle <span class= "ital">'eth</span> (rendered "with") might here be used merely to introduce the subject, we might render: "Now the king's sons were seventy persons; the great men of the city were bringing them up." But such a usage of '<span class= "ital">eth</span> is very doubtful. (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/6-5.htm" title="But as one was felling a beam, the ax head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.">2Kings 6:5</a>.) The sentence, in any case, is only a parenthetic reminder of what was stated in <a href="/2_kings/10-1.htm" title="And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,">2Kings 10:1</a>. The total seventy is, perhaps, not to be taken as exact, seventy being a favourite <span class= "ital">round</span> number.

The reply of the Samaritan authorities gave Jehu an opportunity, of which he was not slow to take advantage. They might have been contented with their negative response, "We will not make any man king;" but they had gone beyond it - they had departed from the line of neutrality, and had placed themselves unreservedly on Jehu's side. "We are thy servants," they had said, "and will do all that thou shalt bid us." It is always rash to promise absolute obedience to a human being. To volunteer such a promise, when it is not even asked, is the height of folly. <span class="cmt_word">If ye be mine</span> - as they had said they were, when they called themselves his "slaves" - <span class="cmt_word">and if ye will hearken unto my voice</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, obey me, do as I require - <span class="cmt_word">take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel.</span> The Samaritan authorities were ordered to bring the heads with them, that they might be seen and counted. In the East generally, the heads of rebels and pretenders, by whatever death they may have died, are cut off, brought to the sovereign, and then exposed in some public place, in order that the public at large may be certified that the men are really dead (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/31-9.htm">1 Samuel 31:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By tomorrow this time.</span> As Jezreel was not more than about twenty miles from Samaria, the order could be executed by that time. It necessitated, however, very prompt measures, and gave the authorities but little time for consideration.
