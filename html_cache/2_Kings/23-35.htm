This payment of silver and gold was a tribute imposed by Pharaoh Neco, indicating Judah's subjugation to Egypt at this time. Historically, this reflects the geopolitical situation where smaller nations like Judah were often caught between the major powers of Egypt and Babylon. The tribute was a common practice in the ancient Near East, serving as a means to maintain political alliances or subjugation. This act of paying tribute is reminiscent of earlier instances in Israel's history, such as when King Hezekiah paid tribute to the Assyrian king Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>).<p><b>but to meet Pharaoh&#8217;s demand he taxed the land</b><br>Jehoiakim's decision to tax the land to meet Pharaoh's demands highlights the economic burden placed on the people of Judah. This taxation would have been a heavy burden, especially during a time when the nation was already weakened by external threats and internal strife. The taxation system in ancient Israel was often based on agricultural produce, and such a levy would have affected the livelihoods of many. This situation reflects the broader biblical theme of leaders who place heavy burdens on their people, contrasting with the ideal of a just and righteous ruler.<p><b>and exacted the silver and the gold from the people</b><br>The phrase indicates that Jehoiakim enforced the collection of silver and gold from the people, which would have been a source of resentment and hardship. This action can be seen as a failure of leadership, as Jehoiakim prioritized foreign demands over the welfare of his own people. The exaction of wealth from the populace is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often leading to social injustice and unrest. This can be contrasted with the biblical ideal of leaders who protect and serve their people, as seen in the reigns of David and Solomon.<p><b>each according to his wealth</b><br>This phrase suggests a graduated tax system where individuals were taxed based on their ability to pay. While this might seem fairer than a flat tax, it still placed a significant burden on the people, especially during times of economic difficulty. The concept of taxing according to wealth is seen in other parts of the Bible, such as the census tax in <a href="/exodus/30-15.htm">Exodus 30:15</a>, where the rich were not to give more nor the poor less than half a shekel. This principle of proportional giving is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to give according to their means (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-12.htm">2 Corinthians 8:12</a>). However, in Jehoiakim's case, the taxation was not for the benefit of the people or the worship of God, but to satisfy a foreign ruler's demands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned from approximately 609 to 598 BC.

That prediction is now visibly playing out.<p>&#8226; The detail reminds us that when God&#8217;s people reject His covenant, political bondage and economic loss follow. Jehoiakim&#8217;s throne is only as secure as Egypt&#8217;s favor, not the Lord&#8217;s.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but to meet Pharaoh&#8217;s demand he taxed the land</b><p>&#8226; Pharaoh&#8217;s &#8220;demand&#8221; signals dominance; Judah is no longer free to decide its own finances.<p>&#8226; The phrase shows that foreign oppression inevitably trickles down to ordinary life. See <a href="/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a>: &#8220;The borrower is slave to the lender.&#8221; Egypt owns Judah&#8217;s purse strings because Egypt owns its king.<p>&#8226; The warning issued to Samuel when Israel asked for a human king&#8212;that rulers would take &#8220;a tenth of your grain and vintage&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-15.htm">1 Samuel 8:15</a>)&#8212;is now realized on a national scale.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and exacted the silver and the gold from the people</b><p>&#8226; Jehoiakim passes the cost to his citizens rather than bearing it personally. His leadership style is later condemned by Jeremiah: &#8220;Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness&#8230;who makes his neighbor serve without wages&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast with godly rulers is stark. David refused to offer the Lord sacrifices that cost him nothing (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>). Jehoiakim, by contrast, refuses to shoulder any burden himself.<p>&#8226; Oppressive taxation had already fractured the kingdom under Rehoboam (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>). Jehoiakim repeats that mistake and further alienates his people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>each according to his wealth</b><p>&#8226; The wording shows a sliding scale: the wealthy paid more. While the concept appears fair, it still represents forced extraction for a pagan power.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s own law expected freewill offerings proportionate to prosperity (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-17.htm">Deuteronomy 16:17</a>), but those gifts were to the Lord, not to Egypt. Under tyranny, what should have been worship becomes tribute.<p>&#8226; The verse subtly contrasts two kingdoms: God&#8217;s kingdom, where giving is worshipful and voluntary, and the world&#8217;s kingdom, where giving is coerced to prop up earthly empires.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/23-35.htm">2 Kings 23:35</a> records the sad chain of compromise: a king enthroned by Egypt must pay Egypt; he finances that payment by levying heavy taxes; the people, already weary, are squeezed yet again. The verse illustrates covenant breakdown&#8212;when God is sidelined, foreign masters and financial burdens rush in. Jehoiakim&#8217;s choice to trust Egypt over the Lord leads directly to oppression for every household in Judah, proving once more that obedience brings freedom, and disobedience always exacts a cost.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">THE REIGN OF JEHOIAKIM</span> (<a href="/2_kings/23-35.htm" title="And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it to Pharaohnechoh.">2Kings 23:35</a> to <a href="/2_kings/24-7.htm" title="And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.">2Kings 24:7</a>).<p>(35) <span class= "bld">And Jehoiakim gave.</span>--<span class= "ital">And the silver and the gold did Jehoiakim give</span> . . .
