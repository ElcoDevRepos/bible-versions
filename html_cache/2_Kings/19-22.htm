The context is the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah. Taunting and blaspheming refer to the Assyrian's mockery and disrespect towards the God of Israel. In the ancient Near Eastern context, blasphemy was a serious offense, often seen as a direct challenge to a deity's power. This phrase underscores the gravity of Sennacherib's actions, as he not only challenged a nation but the God who protected it. Theologically, it highlights the theme of divine retribution against those who defy God.<p><b>Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride?</b><br>Raising one's voice and lifting one's eyes in pride signifies arrogance and defiance. In biblical literature, pride is often condemned as it leads to downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The Assyrian king's pride is evident in his belief that his military might could overpower any god, including the God of Israel. This phrase serves as a reminder of the biblical principle that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). Historically, Assyria was known for its military prowess and often attributed its success to its own strength, disregarding the power of other nations' deities.<p><b>Against the Holy One of Israel!</b><br>The title "Holy One of Israel" emphasizes God's unique and set-apart nature, highlighting His covenant relationship with Israel. This title is frequently used in the book of Isaiah, underscoring God's holiness and His special bond with His chosen people. By using this title, the text reinforces the idea that the Assyrian king's blasphemy is not just against any god, but against the one true God who is intimately involved with His people. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's faithfulness to Israel despite their unfaithfulness, and His ultimate plan of redemption through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.

In <a href="/2_kings/18-28.htm">2 Kings 18:28-35</a> Rabshakeh, his spokesman, had loudly ridiculed both Judah and God, claiming &#8220;Who among all the gods of these lands has delivered his land from my hand?&#8221; (v. 35).<p>&#8226; To &#8220;taunt&#8221; is open mockery; to &#8220;blaspheme&#8221; is direct contempt of God&#8217;s name and character.

He credited himself, ignoring that God &#8220;determines the course of world events&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly warns that pride precedes a fall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>).

Each phrase exposes the escalating insolence&#8212;taunting, loud defiance, haughty eyes&#8212;culminating in the shocking realization that all of it was directed &#8220;against the Holy One of Israel.&#8221; The verse teaches that God personally hears every insult hurled at His name, opposes the proud, and unfailingly defends His holiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">On high</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> towards heaven (<a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm" title="Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things, that brings out their host by number: he calls them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one fails.">Isaiah 40:26</a>).

Whom hast thou dared to insult and defy?" Not an earthly king - not a mere angelic being - but the Omnipotent, the Lord of earth and heaven. What utter folly is this! What mere absurdity? <span class="cmt_word">And against whom hast thou exalted</span> thy voice? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "spoken proudly" - in the tone in which a superior speaks of an inferior - <span class="cmt_word">and lifted up thine eyes on high?</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "looked down upon" - treated with contempt, as not worth consideration - <span class="cmt_word">even against the Holy One of Israel.</span> Isaiah's favorite phrase - used by him twenty-seven times, and only five times in the rest of Scripture - marks this entire prophecy as his genuine utterance, net the composition of the writer of Kings, but a burst of sudden inspiration from the Coryphaeus of the prophetic band. The oracle bears all the marks of Isaiah's elevated, fervid, and highly poetic style. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/19-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Whom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have you taunted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1463;&#1433;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#234;&#183;rap&#772;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2778.htm">Strong's 2778: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pull off, to expose, to betroth, to carp at, defame, to spend the winter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and blasphemed?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1428;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;id&#183;dap&#772;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
