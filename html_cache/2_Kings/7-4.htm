The famine was so dire that people resorted to extreme measures for survival, as described earlier in <a href="/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25-29</a>. The city represents a place of safety and provision under normal circumstances, but due to the siege, it has become a place of death. This reflects the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God, as famine was one of the curses for covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-52.htm">Deuteronomy 28:52-53</a>).<p><b>but if we sit here, we will also die.</b><br>The lepers, who are the speakers in this passage, are outside the city gates due to their condition, which made them ceremonially unclean (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45-46</a>). Their situation is desperate, as remaining where they are offers no hope of survival. This highlights the theme of human helplessness and the need for divine intervention, a recurring theme in the Bible. It also reflects the broader spiritual truth that inaction in the face of spiritual death is not a viable option.<p><b>So come now, let us go over to the camp of the Arameans.</b><br>The Arameans, also known as Syrians, were a significant military power and frequent adversaries of Israel. Their camp represents a potential source of food and survival, albeit with great risk. This decision to approach the enemy camp is an act of desperation but also of faith, as it involves stepping into the unknown. Theologically, it can be seen as a type of repentance, turning away from certain death towards the possibility of life, reminiscent of the prodigal son's return in <a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17-20</a>.<p><b>If they let us live, we will live;</b><br>This phrase expresses a glimmer of hope amidst despair. The lepers acknowledge the possibility of mercy from the Arameans, which is ironic given that they are the enemy. This reflects the biblical theme that God can use unexpected means and people to provide deliverance, as seen in the story of Rahab in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>. It also underscores the sovereignty of God in using even adversaries to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>if they kill us, we will die.&#8221;</b><br>The lepers recognize the risk of death, but it is a risk they are willing to take given their dire circumstances. This acceptance of potential martyrdom can be seen as a foreshadowing of the Christian call to take up one's cross and follow Christ (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-25</a>). It also highlights the biblical principle that sometimes faith requires stepping into situations where the outcome is uncertain, trusting in God's providence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_four_lepers.htm">The Four Lepers</a></b><br>These individuals are the central figures in this verse.

Inside, starvation is so severe that donkey heads and dove dung are sold at outrageous prices (<a href="/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Choosing to enter the city looks reasonable&#8212;except Scripture states plainly that death awaits them there. Human resources are exhausted; no one inside can save them (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>).<p>&#8226; This line exposes the futility of trusting in any refuge apart from God. Just as Egypt proved a broken reed to Judah (<a href="/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>), Samaria offers no life-giving help now.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but if we stay here, we will die also</b><p>&#8226; Remaining at the gate means certain death through starvation or disease. Passive resignation equals slow suicide (<a href="/proverbs/24-10.htm">Proverbs 24:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God often moves when His people refuse to settle for hopeless stagnation. Think of the prodigal son who &#8220;came to himself&#8221; in the pigpen and decided to arise (<a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; The lepers acknowledge reality honestly&#8212;a first step toward any redemptive action (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So come now, let us go over to the camp of the Arameans</b><p>&#8226; This is the only option left. Although the Arameans are the enemy, their camp contains food and supplies.<p>&#8226; The suggestion reflects bold, if desperate, initiative. In effect they are casting themselves upon God&#8217;s providence, much like Esther saying, &#8220;If I perish, I perish&#8221; when she approaches the king (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, God often links deliverance to courageous obedience amid impossible odds (<a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/acts/12-7.htm">Acts 12:7&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If they let us live, we will live</b><p>&#8226; The lepers acknowledge one possible outcome: mercy. Mercy is never demanded; it is received (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; By moving toward the camp, they give room for God to work. Unknown to them, the Lord has already caused the Arameans to flee (<a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>). Faith may begin with a small step that discovers God&#8217;s prior action (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21&#8211;22</a>; <a href="/mark/16-4.htm">Mark 16:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Their reasoning models prudent hope&#8212;recognizing risk yet anticipating grace (<a href="/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If they kill us, we will die</b><p>&#8226; The worst-case scenario simply hastens the inevitable.

Staying put or retreating to self-reliance equals certain death; moving forward in surrendered trust opens the door for divine intervention already in motion. The verse challenges believers to reject fatalistic inertia, face reality truthfully, and step into obedience&#8212;even when outcomes are uncertain&#8212;confident that the God who rules life and death can turn desperate choices into miraculous deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Fall unto</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., desert, go over to.<span class= "bld"></span><p>If they save us alive.<span class= "ital"></span></span>--And give us food, for pity's sake.<p><span class= "bld">We shall but die.</span>--As we shall if we stop here, or if we go into the city.
