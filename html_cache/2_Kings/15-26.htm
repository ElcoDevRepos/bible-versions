His reign is noted for its continuation of the idolatrous practices that characterized the Northern Kingdom. The phrase suggests that there were additional deeds and events during his reign that are not detailed in the biblical narrative, indicating a broader historical context that the biblical authors chose not to include. This reflects the common biblical practice of summarizing the reigns of kings, focusing on their spiritual and covenantal significance rather than exhaustive historical detail.<p><b>along with all his accomplishments</b><br>The term "accomplishments" may refer to political, military, or administrative actions taken by Pekahiah during his reign. However, the biblical text does not elaborate on these, possibly indicating that his reign was not marked by significant achievements or that his actions were overshadowed by his idolatry and the subsequent judgment upon Israel. This omission highlights the biblical emphasis on faithfulness to God over secular success.<p><b>they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</b><br>This phrase refers to a historical record that is distinct from the biblical books of Chronicles. The "Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel" is a non-extant source that likely contained detailed accounts of the reigns of the kings of the Northern Kingdom. Its mention underscores the existence of other historical documents that were used as sources by the biblical authors. This practice of referencing external records is seen throughout the books of Kings, providing a historical framework for the biblical narrative. The emphasis on written records also reflects the importance of documentation and record-keeping in the ancient Near East.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pekahiah.htm">Pekahiah</a></b><br>He was the son of Menahem and became king of Israel.

We have seen the same wording regarding Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/14-19.htm">1 Kings 14:19</a>), Baasha (<a href="/1_kings/16-5.htm">1 Kings 16:5</a>), and many others, reminding us that every king&#8217;s life was fuller than the inspired snapshot we receive. By echoing this formula, the text assures us that God has nothing to hide; He simply includes what best serves His redemptive storyline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with all his accomplishments</b><p>The phrase points to Pekahiah&#8217;s governmental decisions&#8212;military, economic, or civic&#8212;whether righteous or corrupt. From the surrounding verses we know:<p>&#8226; He &#8220;did evil in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/15-24.htm">2 Kings 15:24</a>), persisting in Jeroboam&#8217;s idolatry (cf. <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>).<p>&#8226; His short two-year reign (<a href="/2_kings/15-23.htm">2 Kings 15:23</a>) hints that achievements were limited, yet the record testifies he was no mere figurehead. God notes every action, just as He did with Joash (<a href="/2_kings/14-28.htm">2 Kings 14:28</a>) and Menahem (<a href="/2_kings/15-18.htm">2 Kings 15:18-20</a>). Even swift reigns leave footprints in heaven&#8217;s ledgers (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they are indeed written</b><p>The certainty&#8212;&#8220;indeed&#8221;&#8212;underscores the reliability of contemporary documentation. Similar confidence appears with Jehu (<a href="/2_kings/10-34.htm">2 Kings 10:34</a>) and Uzziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-22.htm">2 Chronicles 26:22</a>). Scripture never treats its words as legend; it points to corroborating records available to the first readers, inviting verification (<a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3-4</a>; <a href="/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>). The Bible is not afraid of historical scrutiny because truth is on its side.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</b><p>This civil archive (distinct from 1&#8211;2 Chronicles, which cover Judah) stored court proceedings, building projects, battles, and taxation&#8212;material much like the annals of the Persians (<a href="/esther/10-2.htm">Esther 10:2</a>). God chose not to preserve that book for us, yet by referencing it more than thirty times (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/15-31.htm">1 Kings 15:31</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-8.htm">2 Kings 13:8</a>), He shows He works through ordinary bureaucratic means as well as prophetic revelation. If human scribes could keep such meticulous notes, how much more does the Sovereign Lord keep flawless records of every life (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/15-26.htm">2 Kings 15:26</a> assures us that Pekahiah&#8217;s brief, troubled reign was fully known and accurately chronicled, even if Scripture selects only the highlights relevant to God&#8217;s larger purposes. The verse models divine transparency, reinforces the historical trustworthiness of the Bible, and reminds us that every deed&#8212;great or small, righteous or wicked&#8212;finds its way into God&#8217;s permanent archives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/15-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for the rest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1435;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ye&#183;&#7791;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3499.htm">Strong's 3499: </a> </span><span class="str2">An overhanging, an excess, superiority, remainder, a small rope</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the acts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#7687;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Pekahiah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#601;&#183;qa&#7717;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6494.htm">Strong's 6494: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pekahiah -- 'Yah has opened (the eyes)', a king of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">along with all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his accomplishments,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they are indeed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
