Elisha succeeded Elijah and performed many miracles, demonstrating God's power and presence in Israel. Gehazi's role as a servant implies a close relationship with Elisha, providing him with unique insights into the workings of God through the prophet. This context sets the stage for Gehazi's actions, highlighting the contrast between his behavior and Elisha's integrity.<p><b>Look, my master has spared this Aramean, Naaman</b><br>Naaman was a commander of the army of the king of Aram (modern-day Syria), a nation often at odds with Israel. Despite being a foreigner and an enemy, Naaman was healed of leprosy by Elisha, which demonstrated God's grace and power extending beyond Israel. Gehazi's reference to Naaman as "this Aramean" reflects a possible disdain or prejudice, emphasizing the tension between Israel and Aram. The healing of Naaman serves as a precursor to the New Testament theme of God's salvation being available to all nations.<p><b>by not accepting what he brought</b><br>Naaman offered gifts to Elisha as a token of gratitude for his healing, but Elisha refused them, illustrating the principle that God's gifts and miracles cannot be bought or earned. This refusal underscores the prophet's commitment to God's glory and the purity of his ministry. Gehazi's focus on the material wealth Naaman brought reveals his greed and misunderstanding of the nature of God's work through Elisha.<p><b>As surely as the LORD lives</b><br>This phrase is an oath, invoking the name of the LORD, which is a serious matter in biblical times. It reflects a common expression used to affirm the truthfulness or seriousness of a statement. However, Gehazi's use of this oath is ironic and hypocritical, as his intentions are deceitful and self-serving, contrasting with the sincerity typically associated with such declarations.<p><b>I will run after him and get something from him</b><br>Gehazi's decision to pursue Naaman and obtain something from him reveals his greed and lack of spiritual discernment. This action directly contradicts Elisha's earlier refusal and demonstrates Gehazi's failure to grasp the lesson of God's grace and provision. Gehazi's pursuit of material gain at the expense of integrity serves as a warning against the dangers of covetousness and the temptation to exploit spiritual authority for personal benefit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gehazi.htm">Gehazi</a></b><br>The servant of Elisha, who becomes central in this account due to his actions driven by greed and deceit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet and man of God, known for his miracles and teachings, who had just healed Naaman of leprosy without accepting any gifts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/naaman.htm">Naaman</a></b><br>A commander of the Aramean army who was healed of leprosy by following Elisha's instructions to wash in the Jordan River.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram (Syria)</a></b><br>The nation from which Naaman hails, often in conflict with Israel during this period.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whose name Gehazi invokes to justify his deceitful intentions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_greed.htm">The Danger of Greed</a></b><br>Gehazi's desire for material wealth led him to sin.

Gehazi may not have known how much it was, but he had seen the laden animals, and rightly concluded that the value was great. <span class="cmt_word">But, as the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.</span> "As the Lord liveth" seems a strange phrase in the mouth of one who is bent on lying and on stealing. But experience teaches us that religious formulae do drop from the lips of persons engaged in equally indefensible proceedings. This is partly because formulae by frequent use become mere forms, to which the utterer attaches no meaning; partly because men blind themselves to the wrongfulness of their actions, and find some excuse or other for any course of conduct by which they hope to profit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/5-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Gehazi,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1495;&#1458;&#1494;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#234;&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;z&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1522.htm">Strong's 1522: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gehazi -- perhaps 'valley of vision', servant of Elisha</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the servant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#8216;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5288.htm">Strong's 5288: </a> </span><span class="str2">A boy, lad, youth, retainer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Elisha</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_477.htm">Strong's 477: </a> </span><span class="str2">Elisha -- 'God is salvation', a well-known Israelite prophet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of God,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
