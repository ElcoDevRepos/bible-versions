He <span class= "ital">may</span> have done so at the time of his invasion under Jehoiakim (<a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm" title="In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.">2Kings 24:1</a>). On that occasion he had carried off some of the sacred vessels (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-7.htm" title="Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.">2Chronicles 36:7</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-2.htm" title="And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.">Daniel 1:2</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/5-2.htm" title="Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.">Daniel 5:2-3</a>; comp. <a href="/ezra/1-7.htm" title="Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;">Ezra 1:7</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span>) It is certainly surprising to find that anything was left in the Temple treasury after the repeated spoliations which it had undergone. The fact not only indicates the probable existence of secret (subterranean) store-chambers, but also lends some support to the chronicler's representations of the great wealth stored up in the sanctuary.<p><span class= "bld">Cut in pieces.</span>--<a href="/2_kings/16-17.htm" title="And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it on the pavement of stones.">2Kings 16:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-24.htm" title="And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 28:24</a>. The meaning seems to be that the gold-plating was now stripped off from such "vessels" as the altar of incense, the table of shewbread, and the Ark. (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/18-16.htm" title="At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.">2Kings 18:16</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord.</span> "Thence" means "from Jerusalem," which he entered and plundered, notwithstanding Jehoiachin's submission, so that not much was gained by the voluntary surrender. A beginning had been made of the carrying off the sacred vessels of the temple in Jehoiakim's third (fourth?) year (<a href="/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a>), which was the first of Nebuchadnezzar. The plundering was now carried a step further; while the final complete sweep of all that remained came eleven years later, at the end of the reign of Zedekiah (see <a href="/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13-17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the treasures of the king's house</span> (comp. <a href="/2_kings/20-13.htm">2 Kings 20:13</a>). If the treasures which Hezekiah showed to the envoys of Merodach-Baladan were carried off by Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15</a>), still there had probably been fresh accumulations made during their long reigns by Manasseh and Josiah. <span class="cmt_word">And out in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon King of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord.</span> (For an account of these vessels, see <a href="/1_kings/7-45.htm">1 Kings 7:45-50</a>.)
