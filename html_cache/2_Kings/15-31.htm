His reign is noted for its military engagements and alliances, particularly with Rezin of Aram against Judah. This phrase suggests that Pekah's actions were significant enough to be recorded, indicating his impact on Israel's history. His reign is also characterized by idolatry and deviation from the worship of Yahweh, which was common among the kings of Israel.<p><b>along with all his accomplishments</b><br>Pekah's accomplishments include his military campaigns and his role in the Syro-Ephraimite War, where he allied with Rezin to attack Judah. This alliance was a strategic move to resist the growing power of Assyria. However, his accomplishments are overshadowed by his failure to lead Israel back to covenant faithfulness. His reign ended with his assassination, reflecting the instability and moral decline of the Northern Kingdom.<p><b>they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</b><br>This phrase refers to a historical record that is no longer extant but was used as a source for the biblical authors. It suggests that Pekah's reign was documented in detail, providing a fuller account of his rule than what is preserved in the biblical narrative. The mention of this book highlights the practice of recording royal annals, a common practice in the ancient Near East, which served as official records of a king's reign.

Those actions show the northern kingdom&#8217;s moral decline climaxing in God&#8217;s judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Along with all his accomplishments</b><p>&#8211; Scripture treats accomplishments broadly&#8212;political, military, economic&#8212;yet the narrative measures them by covenant faithfulness, not human acclaim.<p>&#8226; Military exploits (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>) could look impressive, but Pekah&#8217;s idolatry canceled any eternal value (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-4.htm">Deuteronomy 7:4</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1-9</a> reveals that his coalition war against Judah ultimately failed because the LORD had decreed it.<p>&#8211; The verse reminds us that achievements apart from obedience are fleeting (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are indeed written</b><p>&#8211; The word &#8220;indeed&#8221; underscores certainty.
