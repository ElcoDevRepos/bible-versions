The "evil" refers to actions contrary to God's commandments, often involving idolatry and injustice. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" underscores God's omniscience and the accountability of leaders to divine authority. This evaluation is a recurring theme in the books of Kings, highlighting the spiritual decline of Israel and Judah.<p><b>and throughout his reign</b><br>This suggests a persistent pattern of behavior rather than isolated incidents. The reign of a king was often seen as a reflection of the nation's spiritual state. The duration of a king's reign could be seen as a period of testing or opportunity for repentance, which in this case was not taken. The continuity of evil practices indicates a hardened heart and a failure to heed prophetic warnings.<p><b>he did not turn away from the sins</b><br>This phrase indicates a lack of repentance and reform. Repentance in the biblical sense involves a complete turning away from sin and a return to God. The failure to turn away suggests stubbornness and a refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing. This is a common critique of Israel's kings, who often perpetuated the sins of their predecessors rather than seeking to restore covenant faithfulness.<p><b>that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit</b><br>Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, established a pattern of idolatry by setting up golden calves at Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). This act was a direct violation of the first two commandments and led Israel into sin. Jeroboam's actions set a precedent for subsequent kings, illustrating the long-lasting impact of a leader's sin. The reference to Jeroboam highlights the historical continuity of idolatry and the failure of later kings to break away from this sinful legacy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/menahem.htm">Menahem</a></b><br>The king of Israel during this time, who continued in the sinful practices of his predecessors.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam_son_of_nebat.htm">Jeroboam son of Nebat</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, known for leading Israel into idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, which was often led astray by its kings into idolatry and sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who consistently called His people to repentance and faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sins_of_jeroboam.htm">The Sins of Jeroboam</a></b><br>Refers to the idolatrous practices initiated by Jeroboam, including the worship of golden calves.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_leadership.htm">The Consequences of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders have a profound impact on the spiritual direction of their people.

King Menahem&#8217;s actions&#8212;especially his brutality in <a href="/2_kings/15-16.htm">2 Kings 15:16</a>&#8212;mirror the pattern of earlier northern rulers who &#8220;did what was evil in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-22.htm">1 Kings 14:22</a>). In Scripture, &#8220;evil&#8221; usually points to idolatry and injustice together; both break covenant fidelity with God and harm people made in His image.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and throughout his reign</b><p>Sin was not an isolated lapse but the settled direction of Menahem&#8217;s ten-year rule (<a href="/2_kings/15-17.htm">2 Kings 15:17</a>). Contrast with kings like Asa, who &#8220;did what was right&#8221; for most of his life (<a href="/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11</a>), showing long-term obedience is possible. A reign marked by unbroken rebellion demonstrates a hardened heart (<a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>), and it infects the nation over time (<a href="/hosea/4-9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he did not turn away</b><p>Repentance is the God-given path back to blessing (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>; <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>). Menahem refused it. Notice the active wording: &#8220;he did not turn.&#8221; Turning is a deliberate choice. Even after facing Assyrian pressure and enormous tribute payments (<a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19&#8211;20</a>), he still clung to sin. Persistent refusal to repent invites judgment and eventually exile, as later chapters reveal (<a href="/2_kings/17-22.htm">2 Kings 17:22&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat</b><p>Jeroboam I established rival worship sites at Bethel and Dan with golden calves, telling Israel, &#8220;Here are your gods&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28&#8211;30</a>). That counterfeit system became the default religion of the northern kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/13-33.htm">1 Kings 13:33&#8211;34</a>). Every subsequent king was measured against it. By holding to Jeroboam&#8217;s pattern, Menahem rejected the temple in Jerusalem and the priesthood ordained by God (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had caused Israel to commit</b><p>Leadership influences a whole people (<a href="/luke/6-40.htm">Luke 6:40</a>; <a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>).

Menahem perpetuated that legacy, confirming <a href="/proverbs/29-12.htm">Proverbs 29:12</a>&#8212;&#8220;If a ruler listens to falsehood, all his officials become wicked.&#8221; National sin never excuses personal responsibility; each Israelite still answered to God (<a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>).
