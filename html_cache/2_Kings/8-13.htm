Referring to oneself as a "dog" was a way to express unworthiness or low status. This phrase indicates Hazael's initial shock and disbelief at the prophecy. In the cultural context, dogs were often seen as unclean animals, so this metaphor underscores Hazael's perceived insignificance. The "monstrous thing" refers to the future atrocities Hazael would commit as king, including violence against Israel (<a href="/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32-33</a>). This phrase also highlights the tension between human perception and divine revelation, as Hazael cannot yet see himself in the role Elisha describes.<p><b>said Hazael.</b><br>Hazael was a high-ranking official in the court of Ben-Hadad II, king of Aram (modern-day Syria). His name means "God has seen," which is ironic given the unfolding events. Historically, Hazael's rise to power marked a significant shift in the region's political landscape. Assyrian records outside the Bible also mention Hazael, confirming his historical existence and military campaigns. His dialogue with Elisha is pivotal, as it sets the stage for his future actions and the fulfillment of God's judgment against Israel.<p><b>And Elisha answered,</b><br>Elisha, the prophet and successor of Elijah, plays a crucial role as God's spokesperson. His prophetic ministry was marked by miracles and direct communication with God. Elisha's response to Hazael is not just a prediction but a divine revelation. This interaction demonstrates the authority of the prophet and the certainty of God's plans. Elisha's calm and direct answer contrasts with Hazael's incredulity, emphasizing the inevitability of God's will.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD has shown me that you will be king over Aram.&#8221;</b><br>This prophecy reveals God's sovereignty over nations and leaders. Despite Hazael's current position, God has determined his future as king. The LORD's revelation to Elisha underscores the theme of divine foreknowledge and control over history. This prophecy also fulfills Elijah's earlier commission to anoint Hazael as king over Aram (<a href="/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15</a>), though the anointing itself is not described. Hazael's future kingship would have significant implications for Israel, as he would become a formidable adversary. This statement also serves as a reminder of God's use of foreign rulers to accomplish His purposes, a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hazael.htm">Hazael</a></b><br>Initially a servant of the king of Aram, Hazael is prophesied by Elisha to become king.

Bahr says, "Startled by the revelation of his secret plans, Hazael turned away without answering the earnest words of the prophet."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?</span> This rendering is generally allowed to Be incorrect. The true sense, which is well represented in the Septuagint (<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>;), is - "But what is thy servant, this dog, that he should do so great a thing?" Hazael does not accuse Elisha of making him out a dog in the future, but calls himself a dog in the present. "Dog" is a word of extreme contempt - "the most contemptuous epithet of abuse" (Winer), as appears, among other places, from <a href="/1_samuel/24-14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/16-9.htm">2 Samuel 16:9</a>. Hazael means to say - How is it possible that he, occupying, as he does, so poor and humble a position as that of a mere courtier or domestic (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, Josephus), should ever wage war with Israel, and do the "great things" which Elisha has predicted of him? <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha answered, The Lord hath showed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.</span> Elisha explains how it would be possible. Hazael would not continue in his poor and humble condition. Jehovah has revealed it to him that the mere courtier will shortly mount the Syrian throne. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/8-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;But</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">what [is]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your servant,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7687;&#183;d&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
