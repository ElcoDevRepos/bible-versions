The Rabshakeh was a high-ranking Assyrian official, sent by King Sennacherib to intimidate and demoralize the people of Judah. His words were not just a military threat but a challenge to the power and sovereignty of the God of Israel. The use of "perhaps" indicates a humble acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and the possibility of divine intervention. This echoes other biblical instances where God's people appeal to Him in times of distress, such as in <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>, where God hears the cries of the Israelites in Egypt.<p><b>whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to defy the living God</b><br>The phrase highlights the direct challenge to God by the Assyrian king, Sennacherib. In the ancient Near East, military conquests were often seen as contests between the gods of the nations involved. By defying the "living God," the Assyrians were not just challenging Judah but the very existence and power of Yahweh. This sets the stage for God to demonstrate His supremacy over the false gods of the nations, similar to the showdown between Elijah and the prophets of Baal in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>.<p><b>and He will rebuke him for the words that the LORD your God has heard</b><br>This expresses confidence that God is not only aware of the blasphemous words spoken against Him but is also capable of responding with judgment. The concept of God hearing and responding is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>, where God hears the cries of His people and acts on their behalf. The rebuke of the Assyrian king would serve as a testament to God's power and justice, reinforcing His role as the defender of His people.<p><b>Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that still survives.</b><br>The call to prayer underscores the importance of intercession and reliance on God in times of crisis. The "remnant" refers to the faithful few who remain true to God amidst widespread apostasy and threat. This concept of a remnant is significant throughout the Bible, symbolizing hope and continuity of God's promises, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>. The survival of the remnant is crucial for the fulfillment of God's covenant promises, ultimately pointing to the coming of Jesus Christ, who would emerge from this faithful lineage to bring salvation to all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to reform the religious practices of his people.

It echoes Abraham&#8217;s &#8220;Perhaps&#8221; in <a href="/genesis/18-24.htm">Genesis 18:24</a>, showing reverence for God&#8217;s sovereign freedom while still expecting mercy (<a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;the LORD your God&#8221; acknowledges Isaiah&#8217;s prophetic intimacy with God, yet it also reminds the king and people that the prophet&#8217;s God is their God as well (<a href="/psalms/33-12.htm">Psalm 33:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the words of the Rabshakeh</b><p>- The envoys place every syllable of Assyrian blasphemy before God, trusting that nothing has escaped His notice (<a href="/isaiah/37-4.htm">Isaiah 37:4</a>).<p>- Earlier, the Rabshakeh had taunted, &#8220;Who of all the gods of these lands has delivered his land from my hand?&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/18-35.htm">2 Kings 18:35</a>). The messengers do not sanitize these insults; they treat them as evidence in God&#8217;s court (<a href="/psalms/141-8.htm">Psalm 141:8-10</a>).<p>- When we face slander, Scripture invites us to lay the exact words before the Lord, knowing He hears both the cry of His people and the boasts of the wicked (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to defy the living God</b><p>- The Assyrian threat is not merely political; it is theological.
