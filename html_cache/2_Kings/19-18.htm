In the ancient Near East, it was common for conquering armies to destroy the gods of the defeated peoples as a demonstration of their own gods' superiority. This act symbolized the complete subjugation of the conquered people and the perceived impotence of their deities. The destruction of idols by fire is significant, as fire was often used in purification rituals, suggesting a total eradication of the false gods' influence.<p><b>for they were not gods</b><br>This statement underscores the biblical theme of monotheism, emphasizing that the idols worshipped by the nations were not true deities. The Bible consistently teaches that there is only one true God, the God of Israel. This is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, where the impotence of idols is contrasted with the power and sovereignty of Yahweh. Passages such as <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a> and <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a> echo this sentiment, ridiculing the idea that man-made objects could possess divine power.<p><b>but only wood and stone</b><br>The materials mentioned here, wood and stone, were commonly used in the construction of idols in the ancient world. These materials highlight the physical and perishable nature of the idols, contrasting with the eternal and spiritual nature of the true God. The use of such materials also points to the futility of idol worship, as these objects are lifeless and incapable of action or thought. This is a common biblical critique of idolatry, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-5</a>, where idols are described as being unable to speak, walk, or do any good.<p><b>the work of human hands</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the man-made origin of the idols, highlighting their lack of divine nature or power. The Bible often contrasts the Creator God with the created idols, pointing out the absurdity of worshipping something fashioned by human hands. This critique is found in passages like <a href="/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15-18</a> and <a href="/acts/17-24.htm">Acts 17:24-25</a>, where the true God is described as the maker of heaven and earth, not something made by human hands.

The verse calls believers to abandon every false refuge and rest their confidence in the one true, eternal Creator who can never be cast into any fire.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">And have cast</span> (<span class= "ital">put</span>) <span class= "bld">their gods into the fire.</span>--Comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/14-12.htm" title="And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.">1Chronicles 14:12</a>. The Assyrian's emphatic question, "<span class= "ital">Where</span> are the gods?" implied their annihilation.<p><span class= "bld">For they were no gods.</span>--This idea is common in the latter half of the Book of Isaiah. The question has been raised whether the compiler of Kings has not made Hezekiah express a stricter monotheism than had been attained by the religious thought of his days. But if, as Kuenen alleges, no such definite statement of this belief is to be found in Isaiah and Micah (but comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/2-18.htm" title="And the idols he shall utterly abolish.">Isaiah 2:18-21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-10.htm" title="Take counsel together, and it shall come to nothing; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.">Isaiah 8:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-10.htm" title="As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;">Isaiah 10:10</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span>) we may still point to the words of a third prophet of that age--namely, Amos the herdman of Tekoah. (Comp. <a href="/amos/4-13.htm" title="For, see, he that forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his thought, that makes the morning darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.">Amos 4:13</a>; <a href="/amos/5-8.htm" title="Seek him that makes the seven stars and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night: that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:">Amos 5:8</a>; <a href="/context/amos/9-6.htm" title="It is he that builds his stories in the heaven, and has founded his troop in the earth; he that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.">Amos 9:6-7</a>.) "To Amos . . . the doctrine of creation is full of practical meaning. 'He that formed the mountains and created the wind, that declareth unto man what is His thought, that maketh the morning darkness and treadeth on the high places of the earth, Jehovah, the God of hosts is His name.' This supreme God cannot be thought of as having no interest or purpose beyond Israel. It was He that brought Israel out of Egypt, but it was He too who brought the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir. Every movement of history is Jehovah's work. It is not Asshur but Jehovah who has created the Assyrian empire; He has a purpose of His own in raising up the vast overwhelming strength, and suspending it as a threat of imminent destruction over Israel and the surrounding nations. To Amos, therefore, the question is not what Jehovah as king of Israel will do for His people against the Assyrian, but what the Sovereign of the world designs to effect by the terrible instrument He has created" (<span class= "ital">Robertson Smith</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> We do not think, however, that the utterance of Hezekiah on this occasion was necessarily recorded in writing at the time. The prayer may well be a free composition put into the king's mouth by the author of this narrative. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And have east their gods into the fire.</span> The images worshipped by the various nations are regarded as "their <span class="accented">gods</span>," which they were, at any rate in the minds of the common people. The ordinary practice of the Assyrians was to carry off the images taken from a conquered people, and to set them up in their own country as trophies of victory (see <a href="/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1, 2</a>, where a similar practice is ascribed by anticipation to the Persians). But there are places in the inscriptions where the gods are said to have been "destroyed" or "burnt." It is reasonable to suppose that the images destroyed were those of wood, stone, and bronze, which had little or no intrinsic value, while the gold and silver idols were carried off to the land of the conqueror. No doubt idols of the former far outnumbered those of the latter kind, and, at each sack of a city the "gods" which it contained were mostly burnt. <span class="cmt_word">For they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/42-17.htm">Isaiah 42:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6, 7</a>). Wooden images (the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f79;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) were probably the earliest that were made, and, on account of their antiquity, were often especially reverenced. They were "carved, but rude, with undivided feet, and eyes indicated by a line, the face colored red, or white, or gilt. It was only later that ivory and gold plates were commonly laid over the wood, vested and decked out with ornaments" (Dollinger, 'Jew and Gentile,' vol. 1. p. 240). Stone idols were at first shapeless masses, then pillars or cones, finally imitations of the human form, varying from the rudest representations to the priceless statues of Phidias. In Assyrian times, neither the wooden nor the stone idols were possessed of any artistic beauty. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they have destroyed them.</span> "Gods" of this kind could not help themselves, much less save their devotees or the cities supposed to be under their protection. It was not to be wondered at that the Assyrians had triumphed ever such gods. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/19-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They have cast</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1456;&#1504;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
