These bands were likely raiding parties, a common military tactic used to weaken enemy territories and capture resources or people. This reflects the ongoing hostilities and border skirmishes between Israel and Aram.<p><b>and had taken a young girl from the land of Israel</b><br>The capture of a young girl highlights the personal and human cost of these raids.

The young girl's role as a servant to Naaman's wife places her in a position to influence the events that follow.
