Jezreel was a significant city in the northern kingdom of Israel, serving as a royal residence. The tower provided a strategic vantage point, emphasizing the importance of vigilance. Jezreel's location in the fertile Jezreel Valley made it a key military and agricultural site, often associated with pivotal biblical events, such as the confrontation between Elijah and the prophets of Baal.<p><b>saw Jehu&#8217;s troops approaching</b><br>Jehu, anointed by a prophet sent by Elisha, was on a divinely appointed mission to overthrow the house of Ahab. His approach signifies the fulfillment of God's judgment against Ahab's dynasty, as prophesied by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>). Jehu's troops symbolize the execution of divine justice, a theme recurrent in the narratives of the kings of Israel and Judah.<p><b>and he called out, &#8220;I see a company of troops!&#8221;</b><br>The watchman's alert indicates the presence of a significant military force, suggesting urgency and potential threat. This moment underscores the tension and anticipation of Jehu's arrival, as his mission was not merely political but divinely sanctioned. The term "company of troops" reflects the organized and determined nature of Jehu's campaign.<p><b>&#8220;Choose a rider,&#8221; Joram commanded.</b><br>King Joram, son of Ahab, was reigning in Israel at this time. His command to send a rider reflects a common practice of sending envoys to ascertain the intentions of approaching forces. This decision highlights Joram's concern and the precariousness of his reign, as he was unaware of Jehu's anointing and mission.<p><b>&#8220;Send him out to meet them and ask, &#8216;Have you come in peace?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The question "Have you come in peace?" is significant, reflecting the uncertainty and potential for conflict. In biblical terms, peace (shalom) encompasses not just the absence of war but also well-being and harmony. This inquiry reveals Joram's hope for a peaceful encounter, contrasting with the impending judgment Jehu was bringing. The theme of peace versus conflict is a recurring motif in the biblical narrative, often highlighting the consequences of obedience or disobedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/watchman.htm">Watchman</a></b><br>A sentinel stationed on the tower in Jezreel, responsible for observing and reporting any approaching danger or visitors.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The commander of Israel's army, anointed by a prophet to become king and tasked with executing judgment on the house of Ahab.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joram.htm">Joram (Jehoram)</a></b><br>The reigning king of Israel, son of Ahab, who is in Jezreel recovering from wounds sustained in battle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezreel.htm">Jezreel</a></b><br>A significant city in the northern kingdom of Israel, serving as a royal residence and military stronghold.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/troops.htm">Troops</a></b><br>The company of soldiers led by Jehu, approaching Jezreel as part of Jehu's divinely appointed mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_a_watchman.htm">The Role of a Watchman</a></b><br>The watchman&#8217;s duty is crucial for the safety and preparedness of the city.

His question merely means, "What is the news?" He expects news from the army at Ramoth. Thenius, however, explains "Come ye with friendly or hostile intention?" In that case, would the king have sent <span class= "ital">a single horseman</span> to ascertain the truth?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and the watchman stood on the tower in Jezreel</span>. The watchtower on the southeast, towards Ramoth-Gilead, is intended. There were probably others in other directions; but the writer is not concerned with them. Each watchtower had its one watchman, who gave warning if anything unusual caught his attention. <span class="cmt_word">And he spied the company of Jehu as he came.</span> <span class="accented">Shiph'ah</span> is generally "abundance," "multitude" (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.htm">Deuteronomy 33:19</a>; <a href="/job/22-11.htm">Job 22:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>), but seems here to designate a "baud ' or "company" of moderate size. It is a somewhat rare word. <span class="cmt_word">And said, I see a company.</span> The watchman gave notice to those whose business it was to inform the king, that a band or company of men was approaching the city. <span class="cmt_word">And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?</span> Joram apprehended no danger. If the "company" had been a band of Syrians, or other enemies, coming in hostile fashion, the watchman would have worded his warning differently. The king probably concluded that he was about to receive tidings from the seat of war, and meant to ask, "Is the news good or bad - peaceful or the contrary?" No blame attaches to him for not taking alarm at once. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/9-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the watchman</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1465;&#1508;&#1462;&#1492;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ha&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#333;&#183;p&#772;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
