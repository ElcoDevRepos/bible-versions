The "sight of the LORD" suggests divine omniscience and moral authority. The evil mentioned here refers to idolatry and disobedience to God's commandments, which were prevalent in the Northern Kingdom of Israel. This aligns with the Deuteronomic history theme, where obedience leads to blessing and disobedience to judgment. The phrase echoes the recurring assessment of Israelite kings, emphasizing the covenantal relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>but not like the kings of Israel who preceded him</b><br>This part of the verse suggests a comparative assessment. While the king did evil, his actions were not as egregious as those of his predecessors. The kings before him, such as Ahab, were notorious for their idolatry and leading Israel into sin, particularly through the worship of Baal and other Canaanite deities. This distinction may imply a lesser degree of idolatry or a different form of disobedience. It highlights the progressive nature of sin in Israel's history, where each king's actions are weighed against those who came before. This comparison also serves as a reminder of the cumulative effect of sin and the importance of repentance and returning to the covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hoshea.htm">Hoshea</a></b><br>The last king of Israel, who reigned during a time of significant moral and spiritual decline in the Northern Kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, which was characterized by idolatry and disobedience to God, leading to its eventual downfall.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who consistently called His people to faithfulness and obedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/preceding_kings_of_israel.htm">Preceding Kings of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the kings before Hoshea, many of whom led Israel into deeper idolatry and sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Even though Hoshea's evil was not as severe as his predecessors, it still led to the downfall of Israel.

The comparison shows degrees of wickedness; earlier rulers such as Jeroboam I institutionalized calf worship (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>), Ahab introduced Baalism (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31-33</a>), and Pekah filled the land with violence (<a href="/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Hoshea seems less aggressive in promoting idolatry; he may have tolerated some return to true worship (<a href="/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a> hints he sent messengers to &#8220;So, king of Egypt,&#8221;

The verse reminds us that the Lord measures every leader and nation by His unchanging standard. Degrees of sin do not cancel guilt; only wholehearted obedience and trust in Him bring true deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">But not as</span> <span class= "bld">the kings of Israel that were before him.</span>--The preceding phrase is used of all the northern kings but Shallum, who only reigned a month, and had no time for the display of his religious policy. We can hardly assume that Hoshea abandoned the calf-worship of Bethel, but he may have discountenanced the <span class= "ital">cultus</span> of the Baals and Asheras. The <span class= "ital">Seder Olam</span> states that Hoshea did not replace the calf of Bethel, which, it assumes, had been carried off by the Assyrians in accordance with the prophecy of Hosea (<a href="/hosea/10-5.htm" title="The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.">Hosea 10:5</a>).

De maintained the calf-worship, leant upon "arms of flesh," and turned a deaf ear to the teaching of the prophets e.g, Hoshea and Micah, who addressed their warnings to him. But he was not guilty of any special wickedness - he set up no new idolatry; he seems to have allowed his subjects, if they pleased, to attend the festival worship at Jerusalem (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-11.htm">2 Chronicles 30:11, 18</a>). The rabbis add that when the golden calf of Bethel had been carried off by the Assyrians in one of their incursions, he did not replace it ('Seder Olam,' <a href="/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>.); but it is not at all clear that the image was carried away until Hoshea's reign was over (see Dr. Pusey's comment on Barnes' NotesHosea 10:6 in his ' Minor Prophets,' p. 64). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/17-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
