His request for Elisha to stay behind is part of a series of tests to determine Elisha's commitment and readiness to succeed him. Jericho, a city with a rich biblical history, was the first city conquered by the Israelites under Joshua (Joshua 6). It symbolizes new beginnings and divine intervention. Elijah's journey to Jericho signifies a continuation of God's work and the passing of prophetic authority.<p><b>But Elisha replied, &#8220;As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.&#8221;</b><br>Elisha's response demonstrates his unwavering loyalty and determination to follow Elijah until the end. His oath, invoking the life of the LORD and Elijah, underscores the seriousness of his commitment. This mirrors Ruth's dedication to Naomi (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-17</a>) and reflects the biblical principle of faithful discipleship. Elisha's insistence on staying with Elijah also foreshadows his desire to inherit a double portion of Elijah's spirit (<a href="/2_kings/2-9.htm">2 Kings 2:9</a>).<p><b>So they went to Jericho.</b><br>The journey to Jericho is significant as it marks a transition point in the narrative. Jericho, located near the Jordan River, serves as a backdrop for the miraculous events that follow, including Elijah's ascension and Elisha's confirmation as his successor. The city's historical and geographical context highlights the continuity of God's covenant promises and the unfolding of His redemptive plan. This journey also prefigures the ministry of Jesus, who, like Elisha, would perform miracles and fulfill the prophetic tradition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A major prophet in Israel, known for his powerful ministry and miracles.

The master suggests his tarrying at Bethel, the sacred center, where he will have the company of the "sons of the prophets," and will not be companionless, as perhaps he would have been at Gilgal. He himself is ordered to take a second journey, longer and rougher than the first. <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord hath sent me to Jericho.</span> Will it not be better that Elisha shall spare himself the long and rugged descent from the high-land of Ephraim to the deep gully of Jordan, and remain with the friends who have sought him out, while his master accomplishes the remainder of his journey alone? <span class="cmt_word">And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.</span> Absolute unchangeableness of resolution is best shown by absolute un-changingness of speech. Elisha, therefore, simply repeats his previous words. And the master once more yields. So they came to Jericho. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Elijah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;l&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_452.htm">Strong's 452: </a> </span><span class="str2">Elijah -- 'Yah is God', a well-known prophet of Israel, also three other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
