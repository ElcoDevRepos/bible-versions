This act of receiving foreign envoys was a common diplomatic practice in the ancient Near East, often involving the exchange of gifts and information. The visit of these envoys was significant as it represented Babylon's interest in forming alliances against the Assyrian empire. Hezekiah's reception of the envoys can be seen as a political maneuver, but it also reflects a moment of pride and a lack of discernment, as later events reveal.<p><b>and showed them all that was in his treasure house</b><br>Hezekiah's decision to show the envoys his treasures indicates a desire to impress them with the wealth and resources of Judah. The treasure house would have contained the accumulated wealth of the kingdom, including items dedicated to the temple and the monarchy. This act of revealing his wealth can be seen as a breach of wisdom, as it exposed the kingdom's resources to potential adversaries.<p><b>the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil</b><br>These items represent the wealth and prosperity of Judah during Hezekiah's reign. Silver and gold were standard measures of wealth, while spices and precious oil were valuable trade commodities, often used in religious rituals and as luxury items. The mention of these specific items highlights the material prosperity that Hezekiah enjoyed, which was a result of his successful reign and God's blessing.<p><b>as well as his armory</b><br>By showing the envoys his armory, Hezekiah revealed the military strength of Judah. The armory would have contained weapons and equipment necessary for defense and warfare. This disclosure was particularly unwise, as it provided Babylon with strategic information about Judah's military capabilities, potentially compromising the kingdom's security.<p><b>all that was found in his storehouses</b><br>The storehouses would have included reserves of food, supplies, and other resources necessary for sustaining the kingdom during times of siege or famine. By showing these, Hezekiah demonstrated the kingdom's self-sufficiency and preparedness. However, this act also revealed the extent of Judah's resources to foreign powers, which could have been perceived as a threat or an opportunity for exploitation.<p><b>There was nothing in his palace or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of Hezekiah's disclosure to the Babylonian envoys. It suggests a lack of discretion and an overconfidence in his relationship with Babylon. The comprehensive nature of this revelation foreshadows the future consequences, as Isaiah later prophesies that all these treasures would be carried off to Babylon. This act serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pride and the importance of seeking God's guidance in diplomatic and personal decisions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is known for his faithfulness to God but also for his human weaknesses.

Schrader regards this as an indication that Hezekiah's illness and the embassy of Merodach-baladan belong to the time preceding Sennacherib's invasion. Thenius, however, supposes that Hezekiah simply gave all the <span class= "ital">money</span> in his treasury to Sennacherib's envoys, and stripped off the gold plating of the Temple before them that they might suppose his resources exhausted, when, in fact, he had not touched his real treasures, which were concealed in subterranean chambers. Thenius also refers to the "credible" statement of the chronicler, that presents were made to Hezekiah from all quarters after the retreat of Sennacherib (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-23.htm" title="And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thereafter.">2Chronicles 32:23</a>).

It was a grand thing that his fame should have reached so far as Babylon, a still grander thing to be offered such an alliance. It must be remembered that he and his counselors were inclined from the first to meet Assyrian menace by calling in foreign aid (<a href="/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21-24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/20-6.htm">Isaiah 20:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2-7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>).

Hezekiah did not do this in mere ostentation, though he may have had a certain pride in exhibiting his wealth. His main wish, no doubt, was to make known his resources, and show that he was a valuable ally. So Oroetes acted towards Polycrates (Herod., 3:123), and Hannibal towards the Gortynians (Com. Nep., 'Vit. Hannib.,' &sect; 9). It is to be borne in mind that Hezekiah's treasures were, in <span class="date">B.C. 712</span>, still intact, and included all that ample store which he sacrificed to save Jerusalem at the time of the first expedition of Sennacherib (see <a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>, and comp. 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, where we find enumerated among the treasures given up, besides gold and silver, "precious carbuncles, couches of ivory, elevated thrones of ivory, skins of buffaloes, horns of buffaloes, and weapons"). <span class="cmt_word">The silver, and the gold, and the spices.</span> Compare the description of the wealth of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>).
