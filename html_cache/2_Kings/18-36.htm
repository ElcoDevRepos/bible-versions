The silence of the people reflects obedience to King Hezekiah's command and a strategic choice to not engage with the enemy's psychological warfare. This silence can be seen as an act of faith and trust in their leadership and ultimately in God, contrasting with the fear and panic that the Assyrians intended to incite.<p><b>and did not answer a word</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the complete obedience of the people to Hezekiah's directive. It also highlights the wisdom in not engaging with the enemy's provocations, which could lead to further fear and confusion. The restraint shown by the people can be compared to other biblical instances where silence is used as a form of resistance or trust in God, such as Jesus' silence before His accusers (<a href="/matthew/27-12.htm">Matthew 27:12-14</a>).<p><b>for Hezekiah had commanded</b><br>King Hezekiah's leadership is central in this narrative. Known for his faithfulness to God, Hezekiah's command reflects his reliance on divine guidance rather than human wisdom. His decision to instruct the people not to respond to the Assyrian threats demonstrates his understanding of the power of words and the importance of maintaining faith and unity among the people. Hezekiah's leadership is often seen as a type of Christ, who also leads His people with wisdom and calls for trust in God's plan.<p><b>&#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221;</b><br>This command underscores the importance of discernment in spiritual battles. By instructing the people not to answer, Hezekiah prevents the Assyrians from sowing doubt and fear. This directive can be seen as a call to focus on God's promises rather than the enemy's threats. It also reflects a broader biblical principle of choosing when to speak and when to remain silent, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/26-4.htm">Proverbs 26:4-5</a>, which advises on the wisdom of responding to folly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and reforms to restore proper worship in Judah.

By refusing to trade insults, they acknowledged that victory would come from the Lord, not from clever rebuttals (cf. <a href="/isaiah/36-21.htm">Isaiah 36:21</a>, <a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>, <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and did not answer a word</b><p>The verse stresses total restraint&#8212;&#8220;not a word.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This collective hush displayed unity; no one broke ranks.<p>&#8226; It also shielded hearts from doubt, preventing Rabshakeh&#8217;s rhetoric from taking root (cf. <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often links silence with wisdom: &#8220;Even a fool is considered wise when he keeps silent&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for Hezekiah had commanded</b><p>Hezekiah&#8217;s leadership shines here.<p>&#8226; He recognized that debate with blasphemers produces confusion (<a href="/proverbs/26-4.htm">Proverbs 26:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier he had pointed the people to God&#8217;s strength, not their own (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-7.htm">2 Chronicles 32:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; His command underscores that godly authority sometimes tells us what not to say (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221;</b><p>The king&#8217;s order carries several practical lessons:<p>1.
