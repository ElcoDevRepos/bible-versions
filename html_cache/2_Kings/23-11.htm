The horses dedicated to the sun were likely part of a syncretistic worship practice, blending elements of Canaanite religion with the worship of Yahweh. The sun was a significant deity in many ancient Near Eastern cultures, including the Canaanites and Egyptians. The presence of these horses at the entrance to the temple indicates the extent to which pagan practices had infiltrated the worship of the LORD. Josiah's removal of these horses signifies a return to exclusive worship of Yahweh, in line with the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This act of cleansing is reminiscent of the reforms of Hezekiah, Josiah's great-grandfather, who also sought to eliminate idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>).<p><b>They were in the court near the chamber of an official named Nathan-melech.</b><br>The location of these horses in the temple court suggests that the idolatrous practices had official sanction and were deeply embedded in the religious and political structures of Judah. Nathan-melech, mentioned here, is identified as an official, indicating that even those in positions of authority were complicit in these practices. The mention of his chamber provides a specific historical and archaeological context, suggesting that these reforms were not just spiritual but also involved significant changes to the physical and administrative structures of the temple. This detail underscores the thoroughness of Josiah's reforms, as he sought to eradicate idolatry at every level of society.<p><b>And Josiah burned up the chariots of the sun.</b><br>Burning the chariots of the sun symbolizes the complete destruction of the instruments of idolatry. Chariots, often associated with power and warfare, here represent the might and influence of sun worship. By burning them, Josiah not only removes the physical objects of idolatry but also makes a public statement against the power and influence of these pagan practices. This act can be seen as a fulfillment of the Deuteronomic law, which commands the destruction of idolatrous objects (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>). Josiah's actions prefigure the cleansing work of Christ, who purifies the temple of God, which is now the hearts of believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>). This act of burning also connects to the prophetic imagery of judgment and purification found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/malachi/4.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>, where the day of the LORD is described as burning like a furnace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore the worship of Yahweh and eliminate idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/horses_dedicated_to_the_sun.htm">Horses Dedicated to the Sun</a></b><br>These were symbols of sun worship, which was a form of idolatry that had infiltrated Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/chariots_of_the_sun.htm">Chariots of the Sun</a></b><br>Used in sun worship, these were destroyed by Josiah as part of his reforms.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_the_lord.htm">House of the LORD</a></b><br>The temple in Jerusalem, which was meant to be the center of worship for Yahweh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan-melech.htm">Nathan-Melech</a></b><br>An official in the court of Judah, mentioned in connection with the location of the idolatrous objects.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/z/zeal_for_purity_in_worship.htm">Zeal for Purity in Worship</a></b><br>Josiah's actions demonstrate the importance of removing anything that detracts from the worship of God.

Along with the next clause it states where the sacred horses were kept; viz., in the outer court of the Temple, near the entrance. (So the LXX. and Vulgate. This rendering involves a different pointing of the Hebrew text--<span class= "ital">m</span>?<span class= "ital">bo</span> for mibbo. The latter, which is the ordinary reading, gives the sense, "<span class= "ital">so that they should not come into the house</span>, &c.")<p><span class= "bld">By the chamber.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">towards the cell</span>; further defining the position of the stalls. As to the cells in the outer court, see the Note on <a href="/1_chronicles/9-26.htm" title="For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.">1Chronicles 9:26</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-45.htm" title="And he said to me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.">Ezekiel 40:45</a> <span class= "ital">seq</span>.<p><span class= "bld">Nathan-melech the chamberiain</span>, or, <span class= "ital">eunuch</span>, is otherwise unknown.

The idea of the sun-god as a charioteer, who drove his horses daily across the sky, is one common to several of the Aryan nations, as the Greeks, the Romans, the Hindoos, and others;but we do not find it either in Egypt or among the Semitic peoples. The sacrifice of the horse to the sun was more general (Herod., 1:216; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:3. &sect; 24; 'Anab.,' 4:5. &sect; 35; Rig Veda, vol. 2. pp. 112, <span class="accented">et seqq</span>., etc.), but does not seem to have been adopted by the Hebrews. It is not at all clear whence the "kings of Judah" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Ahaz, Manasseh, and Amon - derived the idea of maintaining sacred chariots and horses to be used in their sun-worship. They certainly could not have received it, as Keil thinks, "through the Assyrians." <span class="cmt_word">At the entering in of the house of the Lord</span> - the horses, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, were kept near one of the entrances to the temple, to be ready for use in sacred processions - <span class="cmt_word">by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs.</span> There were many "chambers" attached to the temple, which were sometimes used as store-rooms for different materials (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/31-11.htm">2 Chronicles 31:11, 12</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/10-38.htm">Nehemiah 10:38</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-5.htm">Nehemiah 13:5</a>), sometimes as residences (<a href="/nehemiah/13-7.htm">Nehemiah 13:7</a>). In Josiah's time, "Nathan-melech the chamberlain," or rather "the <span class="accented">eunuch</span>," <span class="accented">o</span>ccupied one of these. It was situated <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> - "in the outskirts" or "purlieus" of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">And burned the chariots of the sun with fire</span> (comp. vers. 4, 6, 15, etc.). Josiah burnt all the material objects that had been desecrated by the idolatries; the persons and animals so desecrated he "removed," or deprived of their functions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/23-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he removed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#353;&#183;b&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
