His confrontation with King Ahaziah highlights the role of prophets as God's messengers. Ahaziah, the son of Ahab and Jezebel, continued his parents' idolatrous practices, which set the stage for this divine rebuke.<p><b>This is what the LORD says</b><br>The phrase underscores the authority of the message. Elijah speaks not on his own behalf but as a mouthpiece for Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel. This formula is common in prophetic literature, emphasizing that the message is divinely inspired.<p><b>Is there really no God in Israel for you to inquire of His word?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges Ahaziah's faithlessness and highlights Israel's unique relationship with Yahweh. The question implies that Ahaziah's actions are a denial of God's presence and power in Israel, contrasting with the covenant relationship established at Sinai (Exodus 19-20).<p><b>Is that why you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?</b><br>Baal-zebub, meaning "lord of the flies," was a deity worshiped in Ekron, a Philistine city. Ahaziah's decision to seek guidance from a foreign god reflects the syncretism and idolatry prevalent in Israel during this period. This act of seeking a pagan deity's counsel is a direct violation of the First Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying</b><br>This pronouncement of judgment is a direct consequence of Ahaziah's idolatry. The specificity of the prophecy underscores the certainty of God's word. The bed symbolizes Ahaziah's helplessness and impending death, a stark contrast to the life and healing he sought from Baal-zebub.<p><b>You will surely die</b><br>The certainty of Ahaziah's death serves as a divine judgment and a warning to Israel about the consequences of idolatry. This phrase echoes the language of <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>, where disobedience leads to death, reinforcing the theme of divine justice. The fulfillment of this prophecy confirms Elijah's role as a true prophet and the sovereignty of God over life and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God known for his boldness and faithfulness in delivering God's messages, often confronting kings and false prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaziah.htm">Ahaziah</a></b><br>The king of Israel who fell through the lattice of his upper room and sought guidance from Baal-zebub instead of the God of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal-zebub.htm">Baal-zebub</a></b><br>A false god worshiped in Ekron, representing a direct challenge to the worship of Yahweh, the God of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ekron.htm">Ekron</a></b><br>A Philistine city known for its idolatrous practices, particularly the worship of Baal-zebub.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God of Israel, who is sovereign and demands exclusive worship and obedience from His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_exclusivity_of_god.htm">The Exclusivity of God</a></b><br>God demands exclusive worship and allegiance.

Elijah is not giving advice; he is relaying the unchangeable verdict of the covenant-keeping God who declared, &#8220;I am the LORD, that is My name; I will not give My glory to another&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Is there really no God in Israel for you to inquire of His word?&#8221;</b><p>Ahaziah&#8217;s actions say, &#8220;God is absent,&#8221; even though Israel has witnessed:<p>&#8226; The Exodus, proving &#8220;the LORD, He is God; there is no other&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-35.htm">Deuteronomy 4:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Fire from heaven on Carmel, showing &#8220;The LORD, He is God!&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36&#8211;39</a>).<p>To ignore such history is to insult the living God. Today, every open Bible and every empty tomb testifies that He is near and willing to speak (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Is that why you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?&#8221;</b><p>Ahaziah&#8217;s messengers traveled roughly forty miles to a Philistine shrine, bypassing the temple in Jerusalem and the prophets in Israel. This is:<p>&#8226; Idolatry&#8212;a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual unfaithfulness likened to adultery (<a href="/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; A repetition of his parents&#8217; sin; Ahab and Jezebel also pursued Baal (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31&#8211;33</a>).<p>When people prefer counterfeit gods&#8212;whether superstition, self-help, or secular wisdom&#8212;they reveal a heart estranged from the Source of truth (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying.&#8221;</b><p>The sentence is immediate and irreversible; God alone &#8220;kills and makes alive&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>). Ahaziah&#8217;s bed, intended for recovery, becomes his deathbed&#8212;echoing the earlier warning already delivered by Elijah (<a href="/2_kings/1-4.htm">2 Kings 1:4</a>). Healing comes from the Lord (<a href="/psalms/103-2.htm">Psalm 103:2-3</a>; <a href="/john/5-8.htm">John 5:8-9</a>); contempt for Him forfeits that mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;You will surely die.&#8221;</b><p>Sin&#8217;s wage is death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>); the verdict is certain and soon fulfilled (<a href="/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>). As with Adam (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>) and every person since, rejecting God&#8217;s word brings separation and judgment (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). Yet the same God who pronounces death also offers life to all who repent and believe (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-11.htm">1 John 5:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elijah&#8217;s message exposes the folly of seeking answers anywhere but the living God. Ahaziah&#8217;s choice to bypass Scripture and covenant leads to a swift, literal judgment that underscores three timeless truths: God speaks, expects exclusive loyalty, and will not be mocked. Our proper response is to turn to Him first and trust His revealed Word, knowing that in Christ alone we find life instead of the death our sin deserves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">And he said.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">spake</span>. The LXX. adds, "and Elijah said."<p><span class= "bld">Is it not because.</span>--Omit "not."

The words of the oracle are thrice repeated verbally.<p>"Here, just as in other cases," says Bahr, "Elijah reappears suddenly and disappears again, and no one knows whence he comes or whither he goes." The peculiar form of the story suggests that it was derived in the first instance from oral tradition rather than from a written source.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He said unto him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. Elijah</span> said to the <span class="accented">king</span>. Introduced into the royal presence, as a prisoner, perhaps fettered and chained, the prophet in no way lowered his tone or abated from the severity of his speech. Distinctly, in the plainest possible words, he warned the monarch that his end approached - he would never quit the bed whereon he lay, but, <span class="accented">because</span> he had insulted Jehovah by sending to consult the god of Ekron, would surely die. Apparently the king, abashed and confounded, released the prophet, and allowed him to go his way. <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord.</span> Elijah rehearses the words of the message which he had sent by the first of the three captains (see ver. 6). Thus saith the Lord, <span class="cmt_word">Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word! Therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</span> God's determinations are unalterable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/1-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Elijah said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
