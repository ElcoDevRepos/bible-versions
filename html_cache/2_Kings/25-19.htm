The city had been under siege, leading to famine and destruction. The "city" here is Jerusalem, the center of Jewish worship and governance, which had been devastated by Nebuchadnezzar's forces. This remnant represents those who survived the initial onslaught and were still present in the city, highlighting the dire situation and the few who remained.<p><b>he took a court official who had been appointed over the men of war</b><br>The "court official" likely held a significant position within the Judean administration, possibly a high-ranking military officer or advisor. This reflects the Babylonian strategy of removing key leaders to prevent any organized resistance. The "men of war" indicates the military forces of Judah, which had been decimated by the siege. This removal of leadership was a common practice to destabilize conquered regions.<p><b>as well as five royal advisors</b><br>These "royal advisors" were likely part of King Zedekiah's inner circle, providing counsel on matters of state and governance. Their capture signifies the dismantling of the Judean leadership structure. The number five may symbolize completeness or totality, indicating that the entire advisory body was taken, leaving the nation leaderless.<p><b>He also took the scribe of the captain of the army</b><br>The "scribe" was an important administrative figure responsible for record-keeping and communication within the military. This role was crucial for maintaining order and executing military strategies. By capturing the scribe, the Babylonians aimed to disrupt any remaining military organization. The "captain of the army" refers to the chief military leader, whose scribe would have been integral to his operations.<p><b>who had enlisted the people of the land</b><br>This phrase suggests that the scribe was involved in conscripting or organizing the local population for military service. "The people of the land" refers to the common inhabitants of Judah, who were likely called upon to defend the city during the siege. This enlistment underscores the desperate measures taken by Judah in its final defense efforts.<p><b>and sixty men who were found in the city</b><br>The "sixty men" represent a specific group of individuals who were captured alongside the officials and advisors. The number sixty may have symbolic significance, possibly indicating a complete or significant portion of the remaining population. These men could have been leaders, warriors, or influential figures within the community, whose capture further weakened any potential for resistance or rebellion against Babylonian rule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/court_official.htm">Court Official</a></b><br>A high-ranking officer in the royal court, likely responsible for military or administrative duties.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/five_royal_advisors.htm">Five Royal Advisors</a></b><br>These were likely counselors to the king, providing guidance and strategic advice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/secretary_to_the_commander_of_the_army.htm">Secretary to the Commander of the Army</a></b><br>This individual would have been responsible for military communications and record-keeping.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sixty_men_of_the_land.htm">Sixty Men of the Land</a></b><br>These were likely influential or notable men within the city, possibly leaders or elders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Refers to Jerusalem, which was under siege and eventually captured by the Babylonians.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The capture and deportation of Jerusalem's leaders illustrate the severe consequences of Israel's disobedience to God.

This opening phrase reminds us that judgment reached even those who thought they might slip through the cracks (compare <a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he took a court official who had been appointed over the men of war</b><p>Babylon first seizes the military overseer&#8212;likely the chief staff officer to Judah&#8217;s king.<p>&#8226; Military command is neutralized (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-25.htm">Jeremiah 52:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Responsibility is personal: the official is named in Jeremiah but left unnamed here, showing that God tracks individual accountability (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The removal of this strategist fulfills earlier warnings that Judah&#8217;s &#8220;mighty men&#8221; would be handed over (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as well as five royal advisors</b><p>These counselors, once privy to the king&#8217;s plans, are now prisoners. Their capture signals:<p>&#8226; The monarchy&#8217;s counsel is silenced (<a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecy that the &#8220;king&#8217;s men&#8221; would go to Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/38-23.htm">Jeremiah 38:23</a>) comes to pass.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word often singles out leaders first, because influence carries weight (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He also took the scribe of the captain of the army</b><p>The military secretary kept records, tallied troops, and relayed orders (<a href="/2_kings/19-2.htm">2 Kings 19:2</a>). Losing him means:<p>&#8226; Administrative collapse&#8212;no paperwork, no army (2 Chron 34:13).<p>&#8226; Even behind-the-scenes servants are accountable; no role is too small for God&#8217;s notice (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah repeats the detail (<a href="/jeremiah/52-25.htm">Jeremiah 52:25</a>), confirming the historical precision of the event.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who had enlisted the people of the land</b><p>This clause explains why the scribe matters: he organized local militias when regular forces were depleted (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/24-2.htm">2 Samuel 24:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s last-ditch defense depended on ordinary citizens, illustrating the nation&#8217;s desperation (<a href="/jeremiah/4-29.htm">Jeremiah 4:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also hints that common folk were drawn into the leaders&#8217; rebellion against Babylon, fulfilling <a href="/proverbs/29-12.htm">Proverbs 29:12</a>&#8212;&#8220;If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials become wicked.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sixty men who were found in the city</b><p>Beyond top officials, sixty more men&#8212;probably prominent elders&#8212;are rounded up.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah lists the same number (<a href="/jeremiah/52-25.htm">Jeremiah 52:25</a>), highlighting God&#8217;s meticulous record-keeping.<p>&#8226; Sixty echoes earlier censuses where leaders were set apart (<a href="/numbers/11-24.htm">Numbers 11:24-25</a>), but here the separation is for judgment, not service.<p>&#8226; Their fate (25:21) shows that ignoring God&#8217;s repeated calls to repent (<a href="/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4-7</a>) finally brings irreversible consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/25-19.htm">2 Kings 25:19</a> shows Babylon deliberately stripping Jerusalem of every remaining layer of leadership&#8212;military, advisory, administrative, and civic. The verse validates God&#8217;s earlier warnings that disobedience would lead to total national collapse. By recording each role and exact number, Scripture emphasizes divine precision in both judgment and historical detail, assuring us that God&#8217;s word is utterly reliable and that every position of influence carries solemn responsibility before Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">The</span> <span class= "bld">city.</span>--Thenius is probably right in explaining <span class= "ital">the city of David.</span><p><span class= "bld">An officer that was set over the men of war</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a royal officer commanding the garrison of the city of David.
