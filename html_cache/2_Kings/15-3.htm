In the context of the Kings of Israel and Judah, this assessment is significant, as many kings did not follow God's ways. The phrase suggests a standard of righteousness that is measured by adherence to God's law, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-18.htm">Deuteronomy 6:18</a>. It reflects a covenantal relationship where the king's actions are evaluated based on their faithfulness to God. This phrase is often used to describe kings who maintained religious reforms or upheld the worship of Yahweh, contrasting with those who led the people into idolatry.<p><b>just as his father Amaziah had done</b><br>Amaziah, the father of the king in question, is noted for his partial obedience to God. While Amaziah did what was right, his commitment was not wholehearted, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/25-2.htm">2 Chronicles 25:2</a>, where it is mentioned that he did not serve with a perfect heart. This comparison suggests a continuation of a legacy of partial faithfulness. It highlights the importance of generational influence and the impact of a father's actions on his son's reign. The reference to Amaziah also serves as a reminder of the mixed legacy of the kings of Judah, where initial obedience often gave way to later failures. This phrase underscores the need for complete devotion to God, as partial obedience can lead to eventual downfall, a theme echoed throughout the historical books of the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah.htm">Azariah (Uzziah)</a></b><br>King of Judah who reigned for 52 years.

In Scripture, &#8220;right&#8221; is never a vague moralism; it is measured against God&#8217;s revealed standard (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-18.htm">Deuteronomy 6:18</a>: &#8220;Do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD&#8221;).<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-4.htm">2 Chronicles 26:4</a> describes the same king: &#8220;He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done.&#8221; The chronicler highlights specific acts of faithfulness&#8212;seeking God, fortifying Jerusalem, and leading the nation in worship.<p>&#8226; Other kings are assessed by the same yardstick, such as Asa (<a href="/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11</a>) and Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3</a>). Their positive evaluations remind us that God sees and records obedience generation after generation.<p>&#8226; Living &#8220;right&#8221; is active: pursuing justice, worshiping at God&#8217;s temple, and steering clear of idolatry. <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a> affirms the linkage between faith and deeds: &#8220;Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the eyes of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The phrase shifts the focus from human opinions to divine assessment. <a href="/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a> notes, &#8220;Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the hearts.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s eyes are omniscient and holy (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>). He evaluates motives as well as actions (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; For Azariah, this meant that military success or popular approval did not define success; covenant faithfulness did. Even when the surrounding culture tolerated idolatry, the &#8220;eyes of the LORD&#8221; provided the only scoreboard that mattered.<p>&#8226; This standard remains unchanged for believers today (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).

His mixed legacy warns that partial obedience can still shape the next generation, for better or worse.<p>&#8226; Scripture often underscores generational influence: <a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a> promises steadfast love &#8220;to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments,&#8221; while <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a> shows faith passed from Lois to Eunice to Timothy.<p>&#8226; Parents and leaders set trajectories.

The verse invites every believer to pursue active obedience, live under God&#8217;s watchful eyes, and leave a legacy of faith that encourages the next generation to walk in the same path.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And he did that which was right.</span>--This statement is repeated word for word in Chronicles.
