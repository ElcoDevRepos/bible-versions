Her coming in signifies her return to the prophet's presence after a miraculous event. This reflects the cultural practice of seeking out a prophet or man of God for guidance and intervention, as prophets were seen as intermediaries between God and His people.<p><b>fell at his feet</b><br>Falling at someone's feet was a sign of deep respect and gratitude in ancient Near Eastern culture. This act indicates her acknowledgment of Elisha's role as a man of God and her profound thankfulness for the miracle that has just occurred. It also parallels other biblical instances where individuals fall at the feet of Jesus, recognizing His divine authority and power (e.g., <a href="/luke/8-41.htm">Luke 8:41</a>, <a href="/mark/5-22.htm">Mark 5:22</a>).<p><b>and bowed to the ground</b><br>Bowing to the ground further emphasizes her humility and reverence. This gesture is often associated with worship and submission, seen throughout the Old Testament when individuals encounter divine intervention or presence (e.g., <a href="/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a>, <a href="/exodus/34-8.htm">Exodus 34:8</a>). It underscores the recognition of God's power working through His prophet.<p><b>Then she picked up her son</b><br>The act of picking up her son signifies the restoration of life and the fulfillment of Elisha's promise. This miracle is reminiscent of other biblical accounts of resurrection, such as Elijah raising the widow's son in <a href="/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a> and Jesus raising Jairus's daughter in <a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41-42</a>. It serves as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the ultimate resurrection power of Jesus.<p><b>and went out</b><br>Her departure with her son symbolizes the completion of the miracle and the return to normalcy. It highlights the transformative power of faith and God's intervention in the lives of His people. This moment also reflects the peace and restoration that follows divine encounters, as seen in other biblical narratives where individuals are sent away in peace after experiencing God's miraculous works (e.g., <a href="/mark/5-34.htm">Mark 5:34</a>, <a href="/luke/7-50.htm">Luke 7:50</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shunammite_woman.htm">The Shunammite Woman</a></b><br>A notable woman from Shunem who showed great hospitality to the prophet Elisha.
