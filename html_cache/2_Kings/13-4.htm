Seeking the favor of the LORD indicates a turning point where Jehoahaz acknowledges the need for divine intervention. This act of seeking God&#8217;s favor is reminiscent of other biblical figures who turned to God in times of trouble, such as King Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19:1-4</a>) and King David (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>). It reflects a moment of humility and recognition of God&#8217;s sovereignty, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and the LORD listened to him</b><br>The LORD&#8217;s response to Jehoahaz&#8217;s plea demonstrates God&#8217;s mercy and willingness to listen to those who earnestly seek Him, even when they have previously turned away. This is consistent with God&#8217;s character as described in passages like <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, which states that the eyes of the LORD are on the righteous and His ears are attentive to their cry. It underscores the biblical principle that God is compassionate and responsive to repentance and genuine prayer.<p><b>because He saw the oppression</b><br>God&#8217;s awareness of the oppression faced by Israel highlights His omniscience and concern for His people. The oppression by the Arameans was severe, reducing Israel&#8217;s military strength significantly (<a href="/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a>). This phrase emphasizes God&#8217;s justice and His role as a deliverer for those who are suffering, aligning with His actions throughout the history of Israel, such as the deliverance from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>).<p><b>that the king of Aram had inflicted on Israel</b><br>The king of Aram, likely Hazael or his son Ben-Hadad III, was a formidable adversary of Israel during this period. The Arameans were a constant threat, and their oppression was part of the divine judgment on Israel for their idolatry and disobedience (<a href="/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3</a>). This historical context is crucial for understanding the cyclical nature of Israel&#8217;s relationship with God, characterized by periods of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. The oppression serves as a backdrop for God&#8217;s redemptive work and foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who frees humanity from the oppression of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoahaz.htm">Jehoahaz</a></b><br>The king of Israel who reigned during a time of great oppression by the Arameans.

Jehoahaz had previously &#8220;did evil in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/13-2.htm">2 Kings 13:2</a>), yet here he models the truth that repentance is always possible while life remains (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant people were never told to depend on alliances or military might first, but on earnest prayer (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). Jehoahaz&#8217;s act reminds us that even compromised leaders can still call on God, and God hears contrite hearts over impressive r&#233;sum&#233;s (<a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the LORD listened to him</b><p>&#8226; Scripture states it simply: &#8220;the LORD listened.&#8221; Divine response is not mechanical; it is personal.

That promise is confirmed here.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s listening underscores His faithfulness to covenant mercy (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>).

Jehoahaz, as Josephus says, "betook him-serf to prayer and supplication of God, entreating that he would deliver him out of the hands of Hazael, and not suffer him to continue subject" ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:8. &sect; 5). He did not turn from his sin of idolatry, perhaps did not suspect that it was this sin which had provoked God's anger; but in a general way he repented, humbled himself, and besought God's mercy and assistance. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord hearkened unto him.</span> God accepted his repentance, all imperfect as it was, so far as to save the people from the entire destruction with which it was threatened by the severe measures of Hazael (ver. 7), to continue the national existence (ver. 23), and ultimately to restore the national prosperity (ver. 25 and <a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25-27</a>). But he did not remove the oppression, as Josephus imagines, in Jehoahaz's time. Ver. 22 makes this fact absolutely certain. <span class="cmt_word">For he saw the oppression of Israel, because the King of Syria oppressed them.</span> Oppression is always hateful to God, even when he is using it as his instrument for chastising or punishing a guilty people. He "sees" it, notes it, lays it up in his remembrance for future retribution (camp. <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-12</a>, etc.). (On the nature and extent of the oppression of this period, see ver. 7, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/13-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Jehoahaz</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1430;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3059.htm">Strong's 3059: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehoahaz -- 'Yah has grasped', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7717;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
