The concept of beauty in this context is not merely aesthetic but encompasses the idea of appropriateness and purpose. In the biblical narrative, God's creation is described as "very good" (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>), indicating that everything has an inherent beauty and purpose when aligned with God's timing. The Hebrew word for "beautiful" can also mean "appropriate" or "fitting," suggesting that God's timing is perfect, even if it is not immediately apparent to human understanding. This aligns with the wisdom literature theme that God's ways and timing are beyond human comprehension (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><b>He has also set eternity in the hearts of men,</b><br>This phrase suggests that humans have an innate sense of the eternal, a longing for something beyond the temporal world. This concept is unique to humanity, as it reflects the imago Dei, the image of God in which humans were created (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). The awareness of eternity points to a spiritual dimension that transcends earthly existence, indicating a divine purpose and destiny. This longing for eternity can be seen in various cultures and religions throughout history, where people seek meaning beyond the material world. It also connects to the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to set their minds on things above (<a href="/colossians/3-2.htm">Colossians 3:2</a>).<p><b>yet they cannot fathom the work that God has done from beginning to end.</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the limitations of human understanding in grasping the full scope of God's work. The mystery of God's plan is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God's ways are often hidden or beyond human comprehension (<a href="/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7-9</a>). The inability to fully understand God's work underscores the need for faith and trust in His sovereignty. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where the apostle Paul speaks of the mystery of God's will and the unfolding of His plan in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9-10</a>). The phrase also highlights the tension between the temporal and the eternal, where humans live in the present but are aware of a greater divine narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Together these truths call us to trust the divine timetable, nurture our eternal perspective, and rest in humble awe before the incomprehensible wisdom of our Creator.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">In his time.--</span>In modern English, "its."<p><span class= "bld">The world.--</span>The word here translated "world" has that meaning in post-Biblical Hebrew, but never elsewhere in the Old Testament, where it occurs over 300 times. And if we adopt the rendering "world," it is difficult to explain the verse so as to connect it with the context. Where the word occurs elsewhere it means "eternity," or "long duration," and is so used in this book (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-4.htm" title="One generation passes away, and another generation comes: but the earth stays for ever.">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-10.htm" title="Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it has been already of old time, which was before us.">Ecclesiastes 1:10</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-16.htm" title="For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dies the wise man? as the fool.">Ecclesiastes 2:16</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-14.htm" title="I know that, whatever God does, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God does it, that men should fear before him.">Ecclesiastes 3:14</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-6.htm" title="Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.">Ecclesiastes 9:6</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm" title="Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goes to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>). Taking this meaning of the word here (the only place where the word is used with the article), we may regard it as contrasted with that for "time," or season, immediately before. Life exhibits a changing succession of weeping alternating with laughing, war with peace, and so forth. For each of these God has appointed its time or season, and in its season each is good. But man does not recognise this; for God has put in his heart an expectation and longing for abiding continuance of the same, and so he fails to understand the work which God does in the world. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath made every thing beautiful in his</span> (<span class="accented">its</span>) <span class="cmt_word">time</span>. "Everything:" (<span class="accented">eth hacol</span>) does not refer so much to the original creation which God made very good (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>), as to the travail and business mentioned in ver. 10. All parts of this have, in God's design, a beauty and a harmony, their own season for appearance and development, their work to do in carrying on the majestic march of Providence. <span class="cmt_word">Also</span> <span class="cmt_word">he hath set the world in their heart.</span> "The world;" <span class="accented">eth-haolam</span>, placed (as <span class="accented">haeol</span> above) before the verb, with <span class="accented">eth</span>, to emphasize the relation. There is some uncertainty in the translation of this word. The LXX. <span class="accented">has</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Mundum tradidit disputationi eorum</span>. The original meaning is "the hidden," and it is used generally in the Old Testament of the remote past, and sometimes of the future, as Daniel 3:33 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Daniel 4:3<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>, so that the idea conveyed is of unknown duration, whether the glance looks backward or forward, which is equivalent to our word "eternity." It is only in later Hebrew that the word obtained the signification of "age" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>), or "world" in its relation to time. Commentators who have adopted the latter sense here explain the expression as if it meant that man in himself is a microcosm, a little world, or that the love of the world, the love of life, is naturally implanted in him. But taking the term in the signification found throughout the Bible, we are justified in translating it "eternity." The pronoun in "their heart" refers to "the sons of men" in the previous verse. God has put into men's minds a notion of infinity of duration; the beginning and the end of things are alike beyond his grasp; the time to be born and the time to die are equally unknown and uncontrollable. Koheleth is not thinking of that hope of immortality which his words unfold to us with our better knowledge; he is speculating on the innate faculty of looking backward and forward which man possesses, but which is insufficient to solve the problems which present themselves every day. This conception of eternity may be the foundation of great hopes and expectations, but as an explanation of the ways of Providence it fails. <span class="cmt_word">So that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end</span>; or, <span class="accented">without man being able to penetrate</span>; <span class="accented">yet so that he cannot</span>, etc. Man sees only minute parts of the great whole; he cannot comprehend all at one view, cannot understand the law that regulates the time and season of every circumstance in the history of man and the world. He feels that, as there has been an infinite past, there will be an infinite future, which may solve anomalies and demonstrate the harmonious unity of God's design, and he must be content to wait and hope.
