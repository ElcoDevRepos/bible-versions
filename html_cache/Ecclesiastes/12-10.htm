Solomon was renowned for his wisdom, which he sought from God (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>). His quest for "delightful sayings" reflects a pursuit of wisdom that is both pleasing and beneficial. In the ancient Near Eastern context, wisdom literature often included proverbs and sayings that were meant to instruct and guide. Solomon's search for such sayings indicates a desire to impart knowledge that is not only intellectually satisfying but also spiritually enriching. This pursuit aligns with the biblical emphasis on wisdom as a source of joy and life (<a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-18</a>).<p><b>and to record accurate words of truth.</b><br>The commitment to "record accurate words of truth" underscores the importance of truthfulness and reliability in biblical teaching. In a historical context, scribes and teachers were responsible for preserving and transmitting knowledge accurately. Solomon's dedication to truth reflects the biblical principle that God's word is truth (<a href="/psalms/119-160.htm">Psalm 119:160</a>; <a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>). This phrase also highlights the prophetic nature of Scripture, as it points to the ultimate truth found in Jesus Christ, who is described as "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The emphasis on accuracy and truth in Ecclesiastes serves as a reminder of the enduring value and authority of God's word, which remains relevant and trustworthy across generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_teacher.htm">The Teacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>Traditionally understood to be Solomon, the Teacher is the central figure in Ecclesiastes, known for his wisdom and reflections on the meaning of life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Solomon reigned and where much of his wisdom literature, including Ecclesiastes, is believed to have been composed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>The audience or group to whom the Teacher imparts his wisdom, often considered to be the people of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_pursuit_of_truth.htm">The Pursuit of Truth</a></b><br>The Teacher's dedication to finding and recording truth serves as a model for believers to seek and uphold truth in their own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Words have the power to delight and instruct.

On the necessity of a work being attractive as well as conforming to literary rules, Horace long ago wrote ('Ars Poet.,' 99) - <p><span class="foreign">"Non satis est pulchra esse poemata; dulcia sunto,<br />Et quoeunque volent animum auditoris agunto."</span> <p><span class="accented">"'Tis not enough that poems faultless be,<br />And fair; let them be tender too, and draw<br />The hearer by the cord of sympathy."</span> St. Augustine is copious on this subject in his treatise, 'De Doctr. Christ.;' thus (4:26): "Proinde ilia tria, ut intelligant qui audiunt, ut delectentur, ut obediant, etiam in hoc genere agendum est, ubi tenet delectatio principatum .... Sed quis movetur, si nescit quod dicitur? Ant quis tenetur ut audiat, si non delectatur?" <span class="cmt_word">And that which was written was upright, even words of truth.</span> The Authorized Version, with its interpolations, does not accurately convey the sense of the original. The sentence is to be regarded as containing phrases in apposition to the "acceptable words" of the first clause; thus: "Koheleth sought to discover words of pleasure, and a writing in sincerity, words of truth. 'The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "a writing of uprightness;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">et conscripsit sermones rectissimos</span>. The meaning is that what he wrote had two characteristics - it was sincere, that which he really thought and believed, and it was true objectively. If any reader was disposed to cavil, and to depreciate the worth of the treatise because it was not the genuine work of the celebrated Solomon, the writer claims attention to his production on the ground of its intrinsic qualities, as inspired by the same wisdom which animated his great predecessor. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/12-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Teacher</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1465;&#1492;&#1462;&#1428;&#1500;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#333;&#183;he&#183;le&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6953.htm">Strong's 6953: </a> </span><span class="str2">Preacher -- 'a collector (of sentences)', 'a preacher', a son of David</span><br /><br /><span class="word">searched</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(biq&#183;q&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1245.htm">Strong's 1245: </a> </span><span class="str2">To search out, to strive after</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to find</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1465;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(lim&#183;&#7779;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
