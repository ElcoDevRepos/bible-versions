In biblical context, this reflects the unchanging and sovereign character of God, as seen in <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>, "For I the Lord do not change." The permanence of God's works contrasts with the temporal nature of human endeavors, as highlighted throughout Ecclesiastes. This eternal perspective is also echoed in <a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>, "The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of His heart to all generations." The enduring nature of God's actions assures believers of His faithfulness and the ultimate fulfillment of His divine purposes.<p><b>nothing can be added to it or taken from it.</b><br>This phrase underscores the completeness and perfection of God's works. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, where human efforts often sought to manipulate or enhance divine favor, this statement affirms that God's works are self-sufficient and beyond human alteration. This is reminiscent of <a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>, where Job acknowledges, "I know that You can do all things, and that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted." Theologically, this speaks to God's omnipotence and the futility of human attempts to alter His divine will. It also reflects the idea of God's creation being "very good" (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>), needing no addition or subtraction.<p><b>God does it so that they should fear Him.</b><br>The purpose of God's unchangeable and perfect works is to inspire reverence and awe among people. The "fear of the Lord" is a recurring theme in wisdom literature, including <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge." This fear is not about terror but a profound respect and acknowledgment of God's majesty and authority. Historically, this reverence was central to Israel's covenant relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>, where Israel is called to "fear the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways." This fear leads to obedience and worship, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of God's desire for a relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom. He reflects on the nature of life and God's sovereignty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the eternal and unchangeable Creator whose works are perfect and complete.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mankind.htm">Mankind</a></b><br>The verse implies a relationship between God's eternal works and humanity's response, emphasizing reverence and awe.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_permanence_of_god's_works.htm">The Permanence of God's Works</a></b><br>God's actions and creations are eternal and unchangeable.

Thus Ecclus. 18:6, "As for the wondrous works of the Lord, it is impossible to lessen or to add to them (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), neither can the ground of them be found out." <span class="cmt_word">God doeth it, that men should fear before him.</span> There is a moral purpose in this disposal of events. Men feel this uniformity and unchangeableness in the working of Providence, and thence learn to cherish a reverential awe for the righteous government of which they are the subjects. It was this feeling which led ancient etymologists to derive <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="accented">Deus</span> from <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "fear" (comp. <a href="/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3, 4</a>). This is also a ground of hope and confidence. Amid the jarring and fluctuating circumstances of men God holds the threads, and alters not his purpose.
