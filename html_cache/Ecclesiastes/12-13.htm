It reflects the culmination of the Preacher's exploration throughout Ecclesiastes, where he investigates the meaning of life through various pursuits. The phrase implies that after considering all human endeavors and philosophies, a final, authoritative conclusion is reached. This echoes the biblical theme of seeking wisdom and understanding, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>, where wisdom is the principal thing to acquire.<p><b>the conclusion of the matter is this</b><br>The term "conclusion" indicates a final, decisive statement. In the context of Ecclesiastes, it serves as the ultimate answer to the questions of life's purpose and meaning. This conclusion is not just a summary but a definitive resolution to the existential inquiries posed throughout the book. It aligns with the biblical principle that God's wisdom provides clarity and direction, as seen in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, where believers are encouraged to seek wisdom from God.<p><b>Fear God</b><br>"Fear" in this context refers to a profound reverence and awe for God, recognizing His sovereignty and holiness. This fear is foundational to a proper relationship with God, as it acknowledges His authority and our accountability to Him. The concept of fearing God is a recurring theme in Scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, where the fear of the Lord is described as the beginning of wisdom. It underscores the importance of humility and submission to God's will.<p><b>and keep His commandments</b><br>This phrase emphasizes obedience to God's laws as a response to fearing Him. Keeping God's commandments is a tangible expression of faith and reverence, reflecting a life aligned with His will. This mirrors the covenant relationship between God and His people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-2</a>, where obedience to God's commandments is linked to blessings and life. It highlights the biblical principle that true faith is demonstrated through actions.<p><b>because this is the whole duty of man</b><br>The term "whole duty" suggests that fearing God and keeping His commandments encompass the entirety of human responsibility. It implies that life's ultimate purpose is found in a relationship with God, characterized by reverence and obedience. This aligns with the creation narrative in Genesis, where humanity is created to live in fellowship with God and steward His creation. It also resonates with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>, where loving God and others is described as the greatest commandment, encapsulating the essence of the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom. Ecclesiastes is often seen as a reflection on the meaning of life and the pursuit of fulfillment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Solomon originally addressed his writings. The teachings in Ecclesiastes are rooted in the cultural and religious context of ancient Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preacher.htm">The Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>The voice in Ecclesiastes, often identified with Solomon, who explores the purpose and meaning of life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_essence_of_duty.htm">The Essence of Duty</a></b><br><a href="/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a> states, "When all has been heard, the conclusion of the matter is this: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man." This encapsulates the essence of human responsibility before God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_god.htm">Fear of God</a></b><br>The Hebrew word for "fear" (yirah) implies reverence and awe. It is not about being afraid but about recognizing God's majesty and authority in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_commandments.htm">Obedience to Commandments</a></b><br>Keeping God's commandments is a practical expression of our reverence for Him.

The Revised Version gives, <span class="accented">This is the end of the matter</span>; <span class="accented">all hath been heard</span>. The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;</span>, "The end of the matter, the sum, hear thou;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Finem loquendi pariter omnes audiamus.</span> Another rendering is suggested, "The conclusion of the matter is this, that [God] taketh knowledge of all things;" literally, "everything is heard." Perhaps the passage is best translated, <span class="accented">The end of the matter, when all is heard, is this</span>. The first word of this verse, <span class="accented">soph</span>, "end," is printed in the Hebrew text in large characters, in order to draw attention to the importance of what is coming. And its significance is rightly estimated. These two verses guard against very possible misconception, and give the author's real and mature conclusion. When this is received, all that need be said has been uttered. <span class="cmt_word">Fear God</span> (<span class="accented">ha-Elohim</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and keep his commandments.</span> This injunction is the practical result of the whole discussion. Amid the difficulties of the moral government of the world, amid the complications of society, varying and opposing interests and claims, one duty remained plain and unchanging - the duty of piety and obedience. <span class="cmt_word">For this is the whole duty of man</span>. The Hebrew is literally, "This is every man," which is explained to mean, "This is every man's duty." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">Hoc est enim omnis homo</span>. For this man was made and placed in the world; this is his real object, the chief good which he has to seek, and which alone will secure contentment and happiness. The obligation is put in the most general terms as applicable to the whole human family; for God is not the God of the Jews only, but of Gentiles also (<a href="/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
