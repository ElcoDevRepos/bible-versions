In the context of Ecclesiastes, it reflects the theme of vanity and the fleeting nature of earthly pursuits. The Hebrew word for "gain" (yitron) suggests a surplus or advantage, which is often elusive in the temporal world. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>, where Jesus asks, "What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?" The rhetorical nature of the question invites reflection on the eternal versus the temporal, urging readers to consider the spiritual significance of their actions.<p><b>at which he toils</b><br>The word "toils" implies hard work and effort, often associated with the curse of labor given to Adam in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>. This laborious aspect of human life is a consequence of the Fall, highlighting the struggle and pain involved in work. The toil here is not just physical but also mental and emotional, encompassing the entirety of human endeavor. The New Testament offers a contrast in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>, where Jesus invites those who labor and are heavy-laden to find rest in Him, suggesting a spiritual rest that transcends earthly toil.<p><b>under the sun?</b><br>"Under the sun" is a key phrase in Ecclesiastes, used to describe life from a purely earthly perspective. It emphasizes the limitations of human understanding and the futility of life when viewed apart from God. This phrase appears frequently throughout the book, underscoring the preacher's exploration of life's meaning. Theologically, it contrasts with the heavenly perspective offered in <a href="/colossians/3-2.htm">Colossians 3:2</a>, which encourages believers to set their minds on things above, not on earthly things. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the temporal nature of the world, pointing to the eternal hope found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The central place of worship and the political capital during Solomon's reign, representing the heart of Israel's spiritual and cultural life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/under_the_sun.htm">Under the Sun</a></b><br>- A phrase used throughout Ecclesiastes to describe life on earth from a human perspective, emphasizing the temporal and often futile nature of worldly pursuits.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_earthly_pursuits.htm">The Futility of Earthly Pursuits</a></b><br><a href="/ecclesiastes/1-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:3</a> challenges us to consider the ultimate value of our work and efforts.

Solomon later observes, &#8220;What does a man gain for all the toil and striving of his heart with which he labors under the sun?
