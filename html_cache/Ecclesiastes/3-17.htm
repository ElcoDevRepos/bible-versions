In biblical literature, the "heart" often represents the center of thought and emotion. This internal dialogue suggests a moment of wisdom or revelation, akin to the psalmists who often speak to their own souls (<a href="/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>).<p><b>God will judge the righteous and the wicked</b><br>This statement affirms the belief in divine justice, a central theme throughout Scripture. It echoes the sentiments found in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a>, where the fate of the righteous and the wicked are contrasted. The assurance of God's judgment is a recurring theme, providing comfort that ultimate justice will prevail, as seen in <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, where all are judged according to their deeds.<p><b>since there is a time for every activity and every deed</b><br>This phrase ties back to the earlier verses in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3</a>, which poetically describe a time for every purpose under heaven. It underscores the belief in God's sovereign timing and order in the universe. The concept of appointed times is also seen in the prophetic literature, such as <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God changes times and seasons, and in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the fulfillment of time (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>).

In this verse a judgment after this life is clearly spoken of, but not yet asserted as a conclusion definitely adopted, but only as a belief of the writer's conflicting with the doubts expressed in the following verses. "1 said in mine heart," with which <a href="/context/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm" title="I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.">Ecclesiastes 3:17-18</a> both begin, conveys the idea, "I thought," and yet again I thought." The writer returns again to speak of the punishment of the wicked in <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm" title="Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labor the days of his life, which God gives him under the sun.">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-9.htm" title="Rejoice, O young man, in your youth; and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes: but know you, that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.">Ecclesiastes 11:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked</span>. In view of the injustice that prevails in earthly tribunals, Koheleth takes comfort in the thought that there is retribution in store for every man. when God shall award sentence according to deserts. God is a righteous Judge strong and patient, and his decisions are infallible. Future judgment is here plainly stated, as it is at the final conclusion (Ecclesiastes 11:14). They who refuse to credit the writer with belief in this great doctrine resort to the theory of interpolation and alteration in order to account for the language in this and analogous <span class="accented">passages</span>. There can be no doubt that the present text has hitherto always been regarded as genuine, and that it does clearly assert future retribution, though not so much as a conclusion firmly established, but rather as a belief which may explain anomalies and afford comfort under trying <span class="accented">circumstances</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</span> The adverb rendered "there" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, sham) is placed emphatically, at the end of the sentence. Thus the Septuagint, "There is a reason for every action, and for every work there (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>)." Many take it to mean" in the other world," and Plumptre cites Eurip., 'Med.,' 1073 - <p><span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;</span> <p><span class="accented">"All good be with you! but it must be there;<br />Here it is stolen from you by your sire."</span> But it is unexampled to find the elliptical "there," when no place has been mentioned in the context, and when we are precluded from interpreting the dark word by a significant gesture, as Medea may have pointed downwards in her histrionic despair. Where the words, "that day," are used in the New Testament (e.g. <a href="/luke/10-12.htm">Luke 10:12</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-18.htm">2 Timothy 1:18</a>, etc.), the context shows plainly to what they refer. Some take the adverb here in the sense of "then." Thus the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Justum et impium iudicabit Deus</span>, <span class="accented">et tempus omnis rei tunc erit</span>." But really no time has been mentioned, unless we conceive the writer to have been guilty of a clumsy tautology, expressing by "then" the same idea as "<span class="accented">a</span> time for every <span class="accented">purpose</span>," etc. Ewald would understand it of the past; but this is quite arbitrary, and limits the signification of the sentence unnecessarily. It is best, with many modern commentators, to refer the adverb to God, who has just been spoken of in the preceding clause. A similar use is found in <a href="/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>. With God, <span class="accented">spud Deum</span>, in his counsels, there is a time or judgment and retribution for every act of man, when anomalies which have obtained on earth shall be rectified, injustice shall be punished, virtue rewarded. There is no need, with some commentators, to read up, "he appointed;" the usual reading gives a satisfactory sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1444;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in my heart,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;lib&#183;b&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
