This wisdom is not merely intellectual but deeply spiritual, reflecting a profound understanding of life and human nature. Solomon's wisdom is a type of Christ, who is described as the embodiment of wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24, 30</a>). The Teacher's wisdom is foundational to the book's exploration of life's meaning and purpose.<p><b>but he also taught the people knowledge</b><br>Solomon's role as a teacher underscores his responsibility to impart wisdom to others, aligning with the biblical mandate to share God's truth (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>). This teaching is not just theoretical but practical, aimed at guiding the people in righteous living. The dissemination of knowledge is a key aspect of leadership in Israel, reflecting the cultural emphasis on oral tradition and instruction.<p><b>he pondered, searched out, and arranged many proverbs</b><br>The process of pondering and searching out indicates a diligent and intentional effort to understand and communicate truth. This reflects the historical context of wisdom literature, where proverbs were carefully crafted and curated to convey moral and ethical teachings. The arrangement of proverbs suggests a structured approach to wisdom, similar to the compilation of the Book of Proverbs, attributed to Solomon (<a href="/proverbs/1.htm">Proverbs 1:1</a>). This methodical approach is mirrored in the teachings of Jesus, who used parables to convey deep spiritual truths (<a href="/matthew/13-34.htm">Matthew 13:34-35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_teacher.htm">The Teacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>Traditionally identified as Solomon, the Teacher is the central figure in Ecclesiastes, known for his wisdom and reflective teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The audience to whom the Teacher imparts wisdom and knowledge, representing the broader community of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/proverbs.htm">Proverbs</a></b><br>Short, wise sayings that convey practical truths, often associated with Solomon's wisdom literature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_wisdom.htm">The Value of Wisdom</a></b><br>Wisdom is a precious gift that should be sought and cherished.

If so, it seems to me clear that the writer, who has up to this recorded the words of Koheleth, now speaks in his own name, and informs his readers that the preacher, whose teaching of the people he preserves, was also a writer, and the author of the well-known Proverbs.<p><span class= "bld">Moreover.</span>--This, the first word of the epilogue, is one of the specialties of the book of Ecclesiastes. (See <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm" title="Then said I in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it happens even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 2:15</a>.) So is also the word for "set in order" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm" title="That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm" title="Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> - THE EPILOGUE. This contains some observations commendatory of the author, explaining his standpoint and the object of the book, the great conclusion to which it leads. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-11.</span> - Koheleth as teacher of wisdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And moreover</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint); rather, with the following <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;</span> <span class="accented">besides that</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The Preacher was wise.</span> If we render "because the Preacher was wise," we are making an unnecessary statement, as the whole book has demonstrated this fact, which goes without saying. What the writer here asserts is that Koheleth did not merely possess wisdom, but had made good use of it for the instruction of others. The author throws aside his disguise, and speaks of his object in composing the book, with a glance at the historical Solomon whom he had personated. That he uses the third person in relation to himself is nothing uncommon in historical memoirs, etc. Thus Daniel writes; and St. John, Thucydides, Xenophon, Caesar, mask their personality by dropping their identity with the author (comp. also <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-27.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:27</a>). The attestation that follows is compared with that at the end of St. John's Gospel (<a href="/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>), and is plainly intended to confirm the authority of the writer, and to enforce on the hearer the conviction that, though Solomon himself did not compose the work, it has every claim to receive attention, and possesses intrinsic value. <span class="cmt_word">He still taught the people knowledge.</span> As well as being esteemed one of the company of sages, he further (<span class="accented">od</span>) took pains to instruct his contemporaries (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint), to apply his wisdom to educational purposes. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he gave good heed</span>; literally, he <span class="accented">weighed</span> (like our word "ponder"); only thus used in this passage. It denotes the careful examination of every fact and argument before it was presented to the public. <span class="cmt_word">Sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</span> There is no copula in the original; the weighing and the investigation issued in the composition of "proverbs," which term includes not only the wit and wisdom of past ages in the form of pithy sayings and apophthegms, but also parables, truths in metaphorical guise, riddles, instructions, allegories, etc., all those forms which are found in the canonical Book of Proverbs. The same word (<span class="accented">mishle</span>) <span class="accented">is used</span> here as in the title of <span class="accented">that</span> book. Koheleth, however, is not necessarily referring to that work (or to <a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29</a>, etc.), or implying that he himself wrote it; he is only putting forth his claim to attention by showing his patient assiduity in the pursuit of wisdom, and how that he adopted a particular method of teaching. For the idea contained in the verb <span class="accented">taqan</span>, "to place or make straight" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>), applied to literary composition, Delitzsch compares the German word for" author" (<span class="accented">Schriftsteller</span>). The notion of the <span class="accented">mashal</span> being similitude, comparison, the writer's pondering and searching were needed to discover hidden analogies, and, by means of the known and familiar, to lead up to the more obscure and abstruse.
