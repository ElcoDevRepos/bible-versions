The biblical context suggests a call to appreciate the gift of life, echoing themes found in other wisdom literature such as Proverbs, which often highlights the value of a joyful heart (<a href="/proverbs/17-22.htm">Proverbs 17:22</a>). Historically, the ancient Near Eastern culture placed significant value on longevity as a sign of divine favor. Theologically, this can be seen as an encouragement to live a life of gratitude, recognizing each day as a blessing from God. The call to rejoice aligns with the New Testament teachings of Paul, who urges believers to rejoice always (<a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>).<p><b>But let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many.</b><br>This phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the inevitability of difficult times. In the biblical context, "days of darkness" can refer to periods of suffering, trials, or even death. The wisdom literature often balances joy with the reality of life's hardships, as seen in Job's reflections on suffering. Culturally, the ancient Israelites understood life as a mixture of joy and sorrow, and this duality is reflected in their literature and psalms. Theologically, this phrase can be seen as a call to prepare spiritually for adversity, trusting in God's sovereignty. It also foreshadows the New Testament's acknowledgment of trials as a means of spiritual growth (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>).<p><b>Everything to come is futile.</b><br>This concluding phrase reflects the central theme of Ecclesiastes: the futility or vanity of life without God. The Hebrew word "hevel," often translated as "futile" or "meaningless," suggests a vapor or breath, indicating the transient nature of worldly pursuits. This theme is consistent throughout Ecclesiastes, where the Preacher explores the emptiness of life when lived solely for earthly pleasures and achievements. Theologically, this points to the need for a relationship with God to find true meaning and purpose. In the broader biblical narrative, it underscores the hope found in Christ, who offers eternal life and purpose beyond the temporal world (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

The conjunction <span class="accented">ki</span> at the commencement of the verse is causal rather than adversative, and should be rendered "for." The insertion of "and" before "rejoice" mars the sentence. The apodosis begins with "rejoice," and the translation is, <span class="accented">For if a man live many years, he ought to rejoice in them all</span>. Koheleth has said (ver. 7) that life is sweet and precious; now he adds that it is therefore man's duty to enjoy it; God has ordained that he should do so, whether his days on earth be many or few. <span class="cmt_word">Yet let him remember the days of darkness.</span> The apodosis is continued, and the clause should run, <span class="accented">And remember</span>, etc. "The days of darkness ' do not mean times of calamity as contrasted with the light of prosperity, as though the writer were bidding one to be mindful of the prospect of disastrous change in the midst of happiness; nor, again, the period of old age distinguished from the glowing light of youth (Virgil, 'AEneid,' L 590, 591). The days of darkness signify the life in Hades, far from the light of the sun, gloomy, uncheered. The thought of this state should not make us hopeless and reckless, like the sensualists whose creed is to "eat and drink, for to-morrow we die" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>:82; Wisd. 2:1, etc.), but rouse us to make the best of life, to be contented and cheerful, doing our daily duties with the consciousness that this is our day of labor and joy, and that "the night cometh when no man can work ' (<a href="/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>). Wisely says Beu-Sira, "Whatsoever thou takest in hand, remember the end, and thou shalt never do amiss" (Ecclus. 7:36). We are reminded of the Egyptian custom, mentioned by Herodotus (2. 78), of carrying a figure of a corpse among the guests at a banquet, not in order to damp pleasure, but to give zest to the enjoyment of the present and to keep it under proper control. "Look on this!" it was cried; "drink, and enjoy thyself; for when thou diest thou shalt he such." The Roman poet has many a passage like this, though, of course, of lower tendency. Thus Horace, 'Carm.,' 2:3 - <p><span class="accented">"Preserve, O my Dellius, whatever thy fortunes,<br />A mind undisturbed, 'midst life's changes and ills;<br />Not cast down by its sorrows, nor too much elated<br />If sudden good fortune thy cup overfills,"</span> etc.<br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Stanley.</span>) (See also 'Carm.,' 1:4.) <span class="cmt_word">For they shall be many</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that they shall be many</span>. This is one of the things to remember. The time in Sheol will be long. How to be passed - when, if ever, to end - he says not; he looks forward to a dreary protracted period, when joy shall be unattainable, and therefore he bids men to use the present, which is all they can claim. <span class="cmt_word">All that cometh is vanity.</span> All that comes after this life is ended, the great future, is nothingness; shadow, not substance; a state from which is absent all that made life, and over which we have no control. Koheleth had passed the sentence of vanity on all the pursuits of the living man; now he gives the same verdict upon the unknown condition of the departed soul (comp, <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a>). Till the gospel had brought life and immortality to light, the view of the future was dark and gloomy. So we read in Job (Job 10:21, 22), "I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death; a land of thick darkness, as darkness itself; a land of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness." The Vulgate gives quite a different turn to the clause, rendering, <span class="accented">Meminisse debet tenebrosi temporis, et dierum multorum</span>; <span class="accented">qui cum venerint, vanitatis arguentur praeterita</span>, "He ought to remember... the many days; and when these have come, things passed shall be charged with vanity" - which implies, in accordance with an haggadic interpretation of the passage, that the sinner shall suffer for his transgressions, and shall then learn to acknowledge his folly in the past. It is unnecessary to say that the present text is at variance with this rendering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/11-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
