"Under the sun" is a recurring phrase in Ecclesiastes, emphasizing the earthly, temporal perspective of human life. It suggests a viewpoint limited to the material world, often highlighting the futility and unpredictability of life without divine insight.<p><b>The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong;</b><br>This reflects the unpredictability of life, where expected outcomes based on human ability or strength do not always occur. In the ancient Near East, athletic competitions and battles were common, and success was often attributed to speed and strength. However, this observation challenges the assumption that human effort alone guarantees success. This theme is echoed in <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a>, where David, not the strongest or most experienced, defeats Goliath.<p><b>Neither is the bread to the wise, nor the wealth to the intelligent, nor the favor to the skillful:</b><br>Here, the Teacher notes that wisdom, intelligence, and skill do not always lead to material provision, wealth, or favor. This challenges the belief that human attributes and efforts are directly correlated with success. In biblical history, Joseph's rise to power in Egypt (Genesis 41) illustrates that divine providence, rather than mere human skill, often determines outcomes.<p><b>For time and chance happen to all:</b><br>This phrase underscores the role of divine sovereignty and the limitations of human control. "Time and chance" suggest that life is subject to factors beyond human prediction or control, aligning with the biblical theme that God's purposes prevail over human plans (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>). This perspective encourages reliance on God's wisdom and timing, rather than solely on human effort or understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/under_the_sun.htm">Under the Sun</a></b><br>- A phrase used throughout Ecclesiastes to describe life on earth from a human perspective, often highlighting the futility and unpredictability of worldly pursuits.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_swift,_the_strong,_the_wise,_the_discerning,_the_skillful.htm">The Swift, the Strong, the Wise, the Discerning, the Skillful</a></b><br>- These represent human attributes and efforts that are often associated with success but are shown to be insufficient in guaranteeing outcomes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/time_and_chance.htm">Time and Chance</a></b><br>- These elements are depicted as unpredictable forces that affect everyone, regardless of their abilities or efforts.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_race,_the_battle,_bread,_wealth,_favor.htm">The Race, the Battle, Bread, Wealth, Favor</a></b><br>- Metaphors for various aspects of life where human effort is typically expected to yield results.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limitations_of_human_effort.htm">The Limitations of Human Effort</a></b><br>While human effort and skill are valuable, they do not guarantee success.

Work as we may and must and ought, the results are uncertain and beyond our control. This he shows by his own personal experience. <span class="cmt_word">I returned, and saw under the sun.</span> The expression here does not indicate a new departure, but merely a repetition and confirmation of a previous thought - the dependence and conditionality of man. It implies, too, a correction of a possible misunderstanding of the injunction to labor, as if one's own efforts were sure to secure success. <span class="cmt_word">The race is not to the swift.</span> One is reminded of the fable of the hare and tortoise; but Koheleth's meaning is different. In the instances given he intimates that, though a man is well equipped for his work and uses all possible exertions, he may incur failure. So one may be a fleet runner, and yet, owing to some untoward accident or disturbing circumstance, not come in first. Thus Ahimaaz brought to David tidings of Absalom's defeat before Cushi, who had had the start of him (<a href="/2_samuel/18-27.htm">2 Samuel 18:27, 31</a>). There is no occasion to invent an allusion to the foot-race in the formal Greek games. <span class="cmt_word">The battle to the strong.</span> Victory does not always accrue to mighty men, heroes. As David, himself an instance of the truth of the maxim, says (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>), "The Lord saveth not with sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord's" (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither yet bread to the wise</span>. Wisdom will not ensure competency. To do this requires other endowments. Many a man of cultivated intellect and of high mental power is left to starve. <span class="cmt_word">Riches to men of understanding</span>. Aristophanes accounts for the unequal distribution of wealth thus ('Plutus,' 88), the god himself speaking- <p><span class="accented">"I threatened, when a boy,<br />On none but just and wise and orderly<br />My favors to bestow; so Zeus in jealousy<br />Hath made me blind, that I may none of these Distinguish."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Nor yet favor to men of skill</span>. "Skill" here does not mean dexterity in handicrafts or arts, but knowledge generally; and the gnome says that reputation and influence do not necessarily accompany the possession of knowledge and learning; knowledge is not a certain or indispensable means to favor. Says the Greek gnomist - <p><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. <p><span class="accented">"Not prudence rules, but fortune, men's affairs."</span> That time and chance happeneth to them all. We have had the word <span class="accented">eth</span>, "time," all through <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3</a>. and elsewhere; but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, rendered "chance," is uncommon, being found only in <a href="/1_kings/5-4.htm">1 Kings 5:4</a> (18, Hebrew). Everything has its proper season appointed by God, and man is powerless to control these arrangements. Our English word "chance" conveys an erroneous impression. What is meant is rather "incident," such as a calamity, disappointment, unforeseen occurrence. All human purposes are liable to be changed or controlled by circumstances beyond man's power, and incapable of explanation. A hand higher than man's disposes events, and success is conditioned by superior laws which work unexpected results. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
