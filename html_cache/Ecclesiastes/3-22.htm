In the context of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher (traditionally understood as Solomon) observes the fleeting nature of life and the limitations of human understanding. The enjoyment of work is presented as a gift from God, echoing <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>, where Adam is placed in the Garden of Eden to work and take care of it. This enjoyment is not hedonistic but a recognition of God's provision and the fulfillment found in purposeful activity. The cultural context of ancient Israel valued work as a means of sustaining community and family, aligning with the biblical principle that labor is honorable and ordained by God.<p><b>because that is his lot</b><br>The term "lot" suggests a divinely appointed portion or destiny. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the concept of "lot" often referred to the distribution of land or inheritance, as seen in the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>). Here, it implies that God has assigned each person their role and responsibilities in life. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the idea that humans should accept their circumstances with gratitude and contentment, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-12</a>, where Paul speaks of learning to be content in all situations.<p><b>For who can bring him to see what will come after him?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores human limitations in understanding the future. It reflects the biblical theme of the mystery of God's plans, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are higher than human understanding. The phrase also points to the unpredictability of life and the futility of worrying about the future, resonating with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-34.htm">Matthew 6:34</a> about not being anxious for tomorrow. Theologically, it highlights the need for trust in God's providence and the acceptance that only God knows the end from the beginning, as affirmed in <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>. This perspective encourages believers to live faithfully in the present, trusting in God's ultimate plan and timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings. His reflections in Ecclesiastes are often seen as a culmination of his life experiences and insights.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>- The nation over which Solomon reigned. The cultural and religious context of Israel during Solomon's time influences the themes of work, life, and divine providence found in Ecclesiastes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preacher.htm">The Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>- The voice in Ecclesiastes, often identified with Solomon, who explores the meaning of life and the human condition.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_work.htm">The Value of Work</a></b><br>Work is a gift from God and should be enjoyed as part of our earthly existence.

Knowing our limits drives us back to present obedience and trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a> urges wholehearted enjoyment of work, humble acceptance of one&#8217;s God-given lot, and restful trust in the Lord who alone knows the future. Life&#8217;s brevity is not an excuse for despair but an invitation to grateful diligence under a sovereign, generous God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - After all, the writer arrives at the conclusion intimated in ver. 12; only here the result is gathered from the acknowledgment of man's impotence (vers. 16-18), as there from the experience of life. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">so</span>, or <span class="accented">wherefore I saw that there was nothing</span>, etc. As man is not master of his own lot, cannot order events as he would like, is powerless to control the forces of nature and the providential arrangements of the world, his duty and his happiness consist in enjoying the present, in making the best of life, and availing himself of the bounties which the mercy of God places before him. Thus he will free himself from anxieties and cares, perform present labors, attend to present duties, content himself with the daily round, and not vex his heart with solicitude for the future. There is no Epicureanism here, no recommendation of sensual enjoyment; the author simply advises men to make a thankful use of the blessings which God provides for them. <span class="cmt_word">For who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</span> The Revised Version, by inserting "back" <span class="accented">- Who shall bring him back to</span> see? - affixes a meaning to the clause which it need not and does not bear. It is, indeed, commonly interpreted to signify that man knows and can know nothing that happens to him after death - whether he will exist or not, whether he will have cognizance of what passes on earth, or be insensible to all that befalls here. But Koheleth has completed that thought already; his argument now turns to the future in this life. Use the present, for you cannot be sure of the future; - this is his exhortation. So he says (<a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>), "Who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?" where the expression, "under the sun," shows that earthly life is meant, not existence after death. Ignorance of the future is a very common topic throughout the book, but it is the terrestrial prospect that is in view. There would be little force in urging the impotence of men's efforts towards their own happiness by the consideration of their ignorance of what may happen when they are no more; but one may reasonably exhort men to cease to torment themselves with hopes and fears, with labors that may be useless and preparations that may never be needed, by the reflection that they cannot foresee the future, and that, for all they know, the pains which they take may be utterly wasted (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>). Thus in this section there is neither skepticism nor Epicureanism. In brief, the sentiment is this - There are injustices and anomalies in the life of men and in the course of this world's events which man cannot control or alter; these may be righted and compensated hereafter. Meantime, man's happiness is to make the best of the present, and cheerfully to enjoy what Providence offers, without anxious care for the future. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I have seen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
