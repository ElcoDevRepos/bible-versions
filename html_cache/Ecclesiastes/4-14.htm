The imagery of a youth rising from prison to kingship evokes the story of Joseph in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>, who was imprisoned in Egypt before interpreting Pharaoh's dreams and being elevated to a position of power. This transformation underscores the sovereignty of God in elevating individuals according to His purposes, regardless of their circumstances. It also reflects the biblical principle that God can use humble beginnings to achieve His divine plans, as seen in the life of David, who was a shepherd before becoming king (1 Samuel 16).<p><b>though he was born poor in his own kingdom</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the humble origins of the youth, suggesting that he was not only imprisoned but also born into poverty. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual poverty or a lack of worldly status, which is a recurring theme in Scripture. The idea that someone born poor can rise to a position of authority is a testament to God's ability to exalt the humble (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>). It also foreshadows the life of Jesus Christ, who was born in humble circumstances (<a href="/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>) and yet is the King of Kings. This phrase challenges societal norms that equate wealth and status with success, reminding believers that true worth and potential are determined by God's calling and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_man.htm">The Poor Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who rise from humble beginnings or adverse circumstances to positions of influence or authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Symbolizes those in positions of power, possibly highlighting the transient nature of authority and leadership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prison.htm">Prison</a></b><br>A metaphor for difficult or restrictive circumstances from which one can emerge to achieve greatness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/kingdom.htm">Kingdom</a></b><br>Represents the realm or sphere of influence where one exercises authority or leadership.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, offering wisdom on the nature of life, leadership, and human endeavors.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_elevation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Elevation</a></b><br>God can elevate anyone from humble or adverse circumstances to positions of influence according to His purpose.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_and_leadership.htm">Humility and Leadership</a></b><br>True leadership often begins with humility and an understanding of one's origins, fostering empathy and wise governance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_earthly_power.htm">The Transience of Earthly Power</a></b><br>Earthly positions of power are temporary; what matters is how one uses their influence for God's glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>Trust in God's timing and plan, as He can change circumstances in ways beyond human understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_wisdom_over_wealth.htm">The Value of Wisdom Over Wealth</a></b><br>Wisdom and character are more valuable than wealth or status, as they lead to lasting impact and legacy.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ecclesiastes_4_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ecclesiastes 4:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_4_14_Life_s_unpredictability.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 4:14 illustrate the unpredictability of life's circumstances?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_humility_in_Ecclesiastes_4_14.htm">What lessons can we learn about humility from Ecclesiastes 4:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Ecclesiastes_4_14_to_Joseph_s_tale.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 4:14 connect with the story of Joseph in Genesis?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Eccles_4_14_inspire_trust_in_God.htm">In what ways can Ecclesiastes 4:14 encourage us to trust God's sovereignty?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_4_14_Stay_faithful_always.htm">How can Ecclesiastes 4:14 inspire us to remain faithful despite life's changes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_4_14_vs_divine_leadership.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 4:14 challenge the concept of divine providence in leadership transitions?

Joseph moved &#8220;from the dungeon to the palace&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14, 41</a>&#8211;43), foreshadowing this truth.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/113-7.htm">Psalm 113:7&#8211;8</a> echoes the same theme: &#8220;He raises the poor from the dust&#8230; to seat them with princes.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The contrast exposes the frailty of earthly status.

The verse spotlights the emptiness of human pride and the supremacy of God&#8217;s providence&#8212;He can overturn any circumstance, elevate the lowly, and humble the self-assured. Therefore, real wisdom is not found in clinging to position but in fearing the Lord who alone &#8220;raises one and brings down another&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Becometh.--</span>Instead of this translation, it is better to render, <span class= "ital">in his kingdom he was even poor; </span>but there is ambiguity in the Hebrew, as in the English, whether the antecedent of the "his" and the "he" is the old king or the new one.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</span> The ambiguity of the pronouns has induced different interpretations of this verse. It is plain that the paragraph is intended to corroborate the statement of the previous verse, contrasting the fate of the poor, clever youth with that of the old, foolish king. The Authorized Version makes the pronoun in the first clause refer to the youth, and those in the second to the king, with the signification that rich and poor change places - one is abased as the other is exalted. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quod de carcere catenisque interdum quis egrediatnr ad regnum</span>; <span class="accented">et alius natus in regno inopia consummatur</span>. The Septuagint is somewhat ambiguous, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "For from the house of prisoners he shall come forth to reign, because in his kingdom he [who?] was born [or, 'became'] poor." It seems, however, most natural to make the leading pronouns in both clauses refer to the youth, and thus to render: "For out of the house of prisoners goeth he forth to reign, though even in his kingdom he was born poor." <span class="accented">Beth hasurim</span> is also rendered "house of fugitives," and Hitzig takes the expression as a description of Egypt, whither Jeroboam fled to escape the vengeance of Solomon. Others see here an allusion to Joseph, who was raised from prison, if not to be king, at least to an exalted position which might thus be designated. In this case the old and foolish king who could not look to the future is Pharaoh, who could not understand the dream which was sent for his admonition. Commentators have wearied themselves with endeavoring to find some other historical basis for the supposed allusion in the passage. But although many of these suggestions (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Saul and David, Joash and Amaziah, Cyrus and Astyages, Herod and Alexander) meet a part of the case, none suit the whole passage (vers. 13-16). It is possible, indeed, that some particular allusion is intended to some circumstance or event with which we are not acquainted. At the same time, it seems to us that, without much straining of language, the reference to Joseph can be made good. If it is objected that it cannot be said that Joseph <span class="accented">was born</span> in the kingdom of Egypt, we may reply that the words may be taken to refer to his cruel position in his own country, when he was despoiled and sold, and may be said metaphorically to have "<span class="accented">become</span> poor;" or the word <span class="accented">nolad</span> may be considered as equivalent to "came," "appeared," and need not be restricted to the sense of "born." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/4-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the youth] came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from prison</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(mib&#183;b&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
