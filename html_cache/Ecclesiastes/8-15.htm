This perspective is consistent with the wisdom literature's emphasis on finding joy in the present moment. In the context of Ecclesiastes, this commendation is not hedonistic but rather a recognition of life's fleeting nature. The enjoyment of life is seen as a gift from God, aligning with the biblical theme that God desires His creation to experience joy (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>).<p><b>because there is nothing better for a man under the sun</b><br>The phrase "under the sun" is a recurring motif in Ecclesiastes, emphasizing the earthly, temporal perspective. It suggests a focus on the human experience apart from divine revelation. The assertion that there is "nothing better" reflects the book's exploration of life's vanities and the search for meaning. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>, where the enjoyment of simple pleasures is deemed worthwhile amidst life's uncertainties.<p><b>than to eat and drink and be merry</b><br>Eating, drinking, and being merry are symbolic of basic human pleasures and contentment. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, communal meals were significant social and religious events, often associated with covenantal fellowship (<a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18:1-8</a>). This phrase also recalls Jesus' parables, where feasting represents the joy of the Kingdom of God (<a href="/luke/14-15.htm">Luke 14:15-24</a>). The emphasis is on a balanced life that appreciates God's provisions.<p><b>For this joy will accompany him in his labor</b><br>The connection between joy and labor highlights the biblical principle that work is not merely toil but can be fulfilling and meaningful. This reflects the creation mandate in <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>, where Adam is placed in the garden to work it. The idea that joy accompanies labor suggests a divine blessing on human endeavors, countering the curse of laborious toil from <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>.<p><b>during the days of his life that God gives him</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's sovereignty over human life. The recognition that life is a divine gift is a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-15</a>). It underscores the importance of gratitude and stewardship of the time allotted to each person. The temporality of life is a reminder to live purposefully and in alignment with God's will.<p><b>under the sun</b><br>Reiterating the earthly perspective, "under the sun" serves as a reminder of the limitations of human understanding. It contrasts with the eternal perspective found in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/colossians/3-2.htm">Colossians 3:2</a>, which encourages believers to set their minds on things above. This phrase encapsulates the tension between the temporal and the eternal, urging readers to seek wisdom that transcends earthly existence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings. Ecclesiastes reflects his reflections on the meaning of life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which Solomon reigned. The cultural and religious context of Israel during Solomon's time influences the themes of Ecclesiastes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/under_the_sun.htm">Under the Sun</a></b><br>A phrase used throughout Ecclesiastes to describe life on earth from a human perspective, often highlighting the temporal and sometimes futile nature of worldly pursuits.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_gift_of_enjoyment.htm">The Gift of Enjoyment</a></b><br>God has given us the ability to enjoy life, and it is a gift to be received with gratitude.

In the earlier chapters the injunction is based on man's inability to be the master of his own fate; in the present passage the inscrutable nature of the law that directs God's moral government leads to the advice to make the best of circumstances. In neither instance need we trace veiled Epicureanism. The result obtained is reached by acute observation supplemented by faith in God. <span class="cmt_word">Under the sun.</span> The phrase occurs twice in this verse and again in ver. 17, and implies that the view taken was limited to man's earthly existence. <span class="cmt_word">To eat, and to drink</span>, etc. This is not a commendation of a greedy, voluptuous life, but an injunction thankfully to enjoy the good provided by God without disquieting one's self with the mysteries of Providence. So it was said of Israel in its palmy days (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>), "Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry." <span class="cmt_word">For that shall abide with him of his labor</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and that this should accompany him in his labor</span>. The Greek Version regards the verb as indicative, not subjunctive, nor, as others, as jussive: "This shall attend (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) him in his work." But it seems better to consider Koheleth as saying that the happiest thing for a man is to make the best of what he has, and to take with him in all his work a cheerful and contented heart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">commended</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;ib&#183;ba&#7717;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
