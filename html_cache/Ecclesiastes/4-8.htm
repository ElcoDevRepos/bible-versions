In ancient Near Eastern culture, family was central to one's identity and security. Without a son or brother, a man lacked heirs and support, which was considered a significant disadvantage. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the importance of community and family, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>, where God states it is not good for man to be alone.<p><b>And though there is no end to his labor,</b><br>The relentless nature of the man's work is emphasized here. In the context of Ecclesiastes, labor often symbolizes the human struggle for meaning and purpose. The phrase suggests a ceaseless pursuit of success or wealth, reminiscent of the curse of toil given to Adam in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>. This endless labor without fulfillment is a recurring theme in the book, highlighting the futility of human efforts apart from God.<p><b>his eyes are still not content with his wealth:</b><br>Despite his wealth, the man remains unsatisfied, illustrating the insatiable nature of human desires. This echoes the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>, where He warns against greed and the belief that life consists in the abundance of possessions. The dissatisfaction with wealth underscores the biblical principle that true contentment comes from God, not material possessions.<p><b>&#8220;For whom do I toil and bereave my soul of enjoyment?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question reveals the man's internal conflict and realization of the futility of his efforts. The term "bereave my soul" suggests a self-inflicted deprivation of joy and satisfaction. This introspection is a turning point, prompting reflection on the purpose of one's labor. It aligns with the broader message of Ecclesiastes, which encourages readers to find meaning beyond earthly pursuits.<p><b>This too is futile&#8212;a miserable task.</b><br>The conclusion of the passage reiterates the theme of vanity and meaninglessness found throughout Ecclesiastes. The term "futile" (or "vanity" in other translations) is a key word in the book, often used to describe the transient and elusive nature of worldly achievements. This aligns with the biblical understanding that apart from God, human endeavors are ultimately unfulfilling. The "miserable task" underscores the burden of a life focused solely on material gain, contrasting with the peace and purpose found in a relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>Represents an individual who is isolated, working tirelessly without familial connections or companionship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon (Implied Author)</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon reflects on the futility of labor without purpose or relational fulfillment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical context in which the text was written, where family and community were central to identity and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_isolation.htm">The Danger of Isolation</a></b><br>The verse highlights the emptiness of a life lived in isolation, emphasizing the need for relationships and community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_endless_toil.htm">The Futility of Endless Toil</a></b><br>Labor without purpose or enjoyment is described as futile.

Here, he says, is another instance of man's inability to secure his own happiness. Wealth indeed, is supposed to make friends, such as they are; but miserliness and greed separate a man from his fellows, make him suspicious of every one, and drive him to live alone, churlish and unhappy. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he hath neither child nor brother</span>; no one to share his wealth, or for whom to save and amass riches. To apply these words to Solomon himself, who had brothers, and one son, if not more, is manifestly inappropriate. They may possibly refer to some circumstance in the writer's own life; but of that we know nothing. <span class="cmt_word">Yet is there no sad of all his labor</span>. In spite of this isolation he plies his weary task, and ceases not to hoard. <span class="cmt_word">Neither is his eye satisfied with riches</span>; so that he is content with what he has (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>). The insatiable thirst for gold, the dropsy of the mind, is a commonplace theme in classical writers. Thus Horace, 'Caxm.,' 3:16. 17 - <p><span class="foreign">"Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam, Majorumque fames."</span> And Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 14:138 - <p><span class="foreign">"Interea pleno quum turget sacculus ore,<br />Crescit amor nummi, quantum ipsa pecunia crevit."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Neither, saith he, For whom do I labor, and bereave my soul of good?</span> The original is more dramatic than the Authorized Version or the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Nec recogitat</span>, <span class="accented">dicens</span>, <span class="accented">Cui laboro</span>, etc.? The writer suddenly puts himself in the place of the friendless miser, and exclaims, "And for whom do I labor," etc.? We see something similar in ver. 15 and <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:15</a>. Here we cannot find any definite allusion to the writer's own circumstances. The clause is merely a lively personification expressive of strong sympathy with the situation described (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18</a>). <span class="accented">Good</span> may mean either riches, in which case the denial to the soul refers to the enjoyment which wealth might afford, or happiness and comfort. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "goodness," "kindness " - which gives quite a different and not so suitable an idea. <span class="cmt_word">Sore travail</span>;
