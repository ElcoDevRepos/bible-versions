Servants were often acquired through purchase, war, or as a result of debt. The mention of both menservants and maidservants indicates a large household, reflecting the prosperity and influence of the speaker. This aligns with the practices of patriarchs like Abraham, who also had numerous servants (<a href="/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>). The acquisition of servants can be seen as a fulfillment of the blessings promised to Israel, where prosperity was often measured by the size of one's household and possessions.<p><b>and servants were born in my house</b><br>This phrase suggests a stable and established household, where servants were not only acquired but also raised within the home. It indicates a generational continuity and a self-sustaining household economy. In biblical times, having servants born in one's house was considered a mark of long-term wealth and stability. This mirrors the situation of Abraham, whose servant Eliezer was born in his house (<a href="/genesis/15-3.htm">Genesis 15:3</a>). The mention of servants being born in the house also reflects the patriarchal system where the head of the household had significant authority and responsibility over those within his domain.<p><b>I also owned more herds and flocks</b><br>Herds and flocks were primary indicators of wealth in the ancient world, especially in agrarian societies like Israel. The ownership of large numbers of animals signified not only wealth but also the ability to provide for a large household and to engage in trade. This abundance of livestock is reminiscent of the blessings given to the patriarchs, such as Job, who was described as the greatest man among all the people of the East due to his vast herds and flocks (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). The accumulation of livestock is often seen as a sign of divine favor and blessing.<p><b>than anyone in Jerusalem before me</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unprecedented nature of the speaker's wealth and status. Jerusalem, as the political and spiritual center of Israel, was home to many wealthy and influential figures, including kings and nobles. Claiming to surpass all who came before in terms of wealth highlights the speaker's extraordinary achievements. This could be seen as a reflection of King Solomon's reign, known for its unparalleled prosperity and grandeur (<a href="/1_kings/10-23.htm">1 Kings 10:23</a>).

In the Ancient Near East, the more servants a king employed, the more obvious his status (compare <a href="/genesis/24-35.htm">Genesis 24:35</a>, where Abraham&#8217;s wealth is measured partly by &#8220;menservants and maidservants,&#8221;).<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20-22</a> notes that Solomon conscripted vast numbers of workers; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:7</a> shows he also purchased servants outright.<p>&#8226; Yet later he confesses, &#8220;Then I considered all that my hands had done&#8230;and behold, all was vanity&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:11</a>).

Earthly security falls short of eternal significance (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me</b><p>&#8226; Livestock functioned as currency, food supply, and status symbol (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a> counts sheep and camels among Job&#8217;s riches). Solomon&#8217;s herds eclipsed all previous kings, aligning with <a href="/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/9-27.htm">2 Chronicles 9:27</a>, where silver became &#8220;as common as stones.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores superlative wealth: &#8220;more&#8230;than anyone in Jerusalem before me.&#8221; His empire set a new benchmark for affluence, echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/8-13.htm">Deuteronomy 8:13</a>&#8217;s description of abundant &#8220;herds and flocks.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Yet Ecclesiastes continuously contrasts &#8220;under the sun&#8221; success with the ultimate conclusion that fearing God is the only lasting good (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/2-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:7</a> portrays Solomon&#8217;s unparalleled prosperity&#8212;servants purchased, servants born in his palace, and record-breaking herds and flocks. Each achievement showcases outward greatness but also sets up the book&#8217;s refrain: earthly gain, even at its peak, cannot fill the God-shaped void in the human heart. True meaning arises only when wealth and work are surrendered to the Lord, who alone imparts lasting joy and purpose.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Got me</span>.--The servants acquired by purchase are distinguished from those born in the house.

They were much more esteemed by their masters, and showed a much closer attachment to the family than the bought slaves or the conquered aboriginals, who were often reduced to this state (<a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20, 21</a>). The number of Solomon's attendants excited the wonder of the Queen of Sheba (<a href="/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>, etc.; 1 Kings 10:5), and with good reason, if Josephus's account is to be believed. This writer asserts that the king had some thousand or more chariots, and twenty thousand horses. The drivers and riders were young men of comely aspect, tall and well-made; they had long flowing hair, and wore tunics of Tyrian purple, and powdered their hair with gold dust, which glittered in the rays of the sun ('Ant.,' 8:07. 3). Attended by a cavalcade thus arrayed, Solomon used to betake himself to his "paradise" at Etham, to enjoy the refreshing coolness of its trees and pools. <span class="cmt_word">Great and small cattle</span>; <span class="accented">oxen and sheep</span>. The enormous amount of Solomon's herds and flocks is proved by the extraordinary multitude of the sacrifices at the consecration of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>), and the lavish provision made daily for the wants of his table (<a href="/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22, 23</a>). The cattle of David were very numerous, and required special overlookers (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-29.htm">1 Chronicles 27:29-31</a>). Job (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>) had, before his troubles, seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and these items were all doubled at the return of his prosperity. Among Solomon's possessions, horses are not here mentioned, though they formed no inconsiderable portion of his live stock, and added greatly to his magnificence. Koheleth, perhaps, avoided boasting of this extravagance in consideration of the religious sentiment which was strongly opposed to such a feature. <span class="cmt_word">That were in Jerusalem before me</span> (so ver. 9; see <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:16</a>).
