In biblical context, the mouth often symbolizes the heart's intentions (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). The warning here is against rash vows or promises, which were common in ancient Israelite culture. The Law of Moses addressed the seriousness of vows (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>), highlighting the importance of integrity and the consequences of failing to fulfill one's word. The connection between speech and action is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>, where the tongue is described as a small part of the body that can cause great harm.<p><b>and do not tell the messenger that your vow was a mistake</b><br>In ancient times, a messenger or priest might be sent to collect on vows made to God. This phrase warns against attempting to retract a vow by claiming it was made in error. Such actions reflect a lack of reverence for God and a failure to recognize the sanctity of one's promises. The cultural context underscores the seriousness of vows, as they were considered binding and sacred. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, where He advises against making oaths altogether, advocating for simple and honest communication.<p><b>Why should God be angry with your words</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the divine response to insincere or careless speech. In the Old Testament, God's anger is often depicted as a response to disobedience and irreverence (<a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>). The phrase serves as a reminder of God's holiness and the expectation of His people to uphold their commitments. It reflects the broader biblical principle that God values truth and integrity, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>, which states that lying lips are an abomination to the Lord.<p><b>and destroy the work of your hands?</b><br>The consequence of God's anger is described as the destruction of one's labor. This reflects the biblical principle of divine retribution, where disobedience leads to tangible consequences (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>). The "work of your hands" symbolizes one's efforts and achievements, which can be undone by God's judgment. This serves as a warning to maintain integrity and sincerity in one's relationship with God. The phrase also echoes the futility of human endeavors without divine favor, a theme prevalent throughout Ecclesiastes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preacher.htm">The Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>Traditionally identified as King Solomon, the author of Ecclesiastes, who shares wisdom on the futility of life without God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and authority who holds individuals accountable for their words and actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_messenger.htm">The Messenger</a></b><br>Likely a temple official or priest who would hear vows and ensure they are fulfilled.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vow.htm">The Vow</a></b><br>A solemn promise made to God, often in the context of worship or seeking divine favor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_work_of_your_hands.htm">The Work of Your Hands</a></b><br>Represents the efforts and achievements of an individual, which can be jeopardized by careless words.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_your_words.htm">Guard Your Words</a></b><br>Our words have power and can lead us into sin.

Thoughtful, truthful, and obedient speech honors the Lord and safeguards the work He entrusts to us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">The angel.</span>--It has been proposed to translate this word the "messenger," or ambassador of God, and understand "the priest" (see <a href="/malachi/2-7.htm" title="For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 2:7</a>); and it has been regarded as one of the notes of later date in this book that the word should be used in such a sense. But even in the passage of Malachi there is no trace that the word "angel" had then become an ordinary name for the priest, such as would be intelligible if used in that sense without explanation from the context. Neither, again, is there reason for supposing that the priest had power to dispense with vows alleged to have been rashly undertaken. The power given him (Leviticus 27) is of a different nature. I therefore adhere to the obvious sense, which suggests that the real vow is observed and recorded by a heavenly angel. It falls in with this view that the phrase is "<span class= "ital">before </span>the angel." If an excuse pleaded to a priest was intended, we should have, "Say not thou <span class= "ital">to </span>the priest."<p><span class= "bld">Error.</span>--The word is that which describes sins of <span class= "ital">ignorance </span>(Numbers 15). The tacit assumption in this verse, that God interposes to punish when His name is taken in vain, clearly expresses the writer's real conviction, and shows that such a verse as <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm" title="All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrifices, and to him that sacrifices not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that swears, as he that fears an oath.">Ecclesiastes 9:2</a> is only the statement of a speculative difficulty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin</span>. "Thy flesh" is equivalent to "thyself," the whole personality, the idea of the flesh, as a distinct part of the man, sinning, being alien from Old Testament ontology. The injunction means - Do not, by uttering rash or inconsiderate vows, which you afterwards evade or cannot fulfill, bring sin upon yourself, or, as others render, bring punishment upon yourself. Septuagint, "Suffer not thy mouth to Cause thy flesh to sin(<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ut peccare facias carnem tuam</span>. Another interpretation, but not so suitable, is this - Do not let thy mouth (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. thy appetite) lead thee to break the vow of abstinence, and indulge in meat or drink from which (as, <span class="accented">e.g</span>., a Nazarite) thou wast bound to abstain. <span class="cmt_word">Neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error</span>. If we take "angel" (<span class="accented">malak</span>) in the usual sense (and there seems no very forcible reason why we should not), it must mean the angel of God in whose special charge you are placed, or the angel who was supposed to preside over the altar of worship, or that messenger of God whose duty it is to watch man's doings and to act as the minister of punishment (<a href="/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>). The workings of God's providence are often attributed to angels; and sometimes the names of God and angel are interchanged (see <a href="/genesis/16-9.htm">Genesis 16:9, 13</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2, 3</a>, etc.; <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2, 4</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a>, etc.). Thus the Septuagint here renders, "Say not before the face of God (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="accented"> = </span><span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)." If this interpretation be allowed, we have an argument for the literal explanation of the much-disputed passage in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-10.htm">1 Corinthians 11:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>. Thus, too, in 'The Testaments of the XII. Patriarchs,' we have, "The Lord is witness, and his angels are witnesses, concerning the word of your mouth" ('Levi,' 19). But most commentators consider that the word here means "messenger" of Jehovah, in the sense of priest, the announcer of the Divine Law, as in the unique passage <a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>. Traces of a similar use of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may be found in the New Testament (<a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>, etc.). According to the first interpretation, the man comes before God with his excuse; according to the second, he comes to the priest, and confesses that he was thoughtless and overhasty in making his vow, and desires to be released from it, or, at any rate, by some means to evade its fulfillment. His excuse may possibly look to the cases mentioned in <a href="/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22</a>, etc., and he may wish to urge that the vow was made in ignorance (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "It is an ignorance"), and that therefore he was not responsible for its incomplete execution. We do not know that a priest or any officer of the temple had authority to release from the obligation of a <span class="accented">Tow</span>, <span class="accented">so</span> that the excuse made "before" him would seem to be objectless, while the evasion of a solemn promise made in the Name of God might well be said to be done in the presence of the observing and recording angel. The Vulgate rendering, <span class="accented">Non eat providentia</span>, makes the man account for his neglect by assuming that God takes no heed of such things; he deems the long-suffering of God to be indifference and disregard (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>). The original does not bear this interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore should God be angry at thy voice</span> - the words in which thy evasion and dishonesty are expressed - <span class="cmt_word">and destroy the work of thine hands?</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. punish thee by calamity, want of success, sickness, etc., God's moral government being vindicated by earthly visitations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">let</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(tit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your mouth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1433;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
