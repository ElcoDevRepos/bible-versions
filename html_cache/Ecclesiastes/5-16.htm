The term "grievous affliction" suggests a profound burden or misfortune, echoing the themes of vanity and meaninglessness found throughout Ecclesiastes. This sentiment is consistent with the book's exploration of life's transient nature and the limitations of human wisdom and effort.<p><b>Exactly as a man is born, so he will depart:</b><br>This phrase underscores the inevitability of death and the equality it brings to all people, regardless of their status or achievements. It reflects the biblical theme of human mortality, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, where God tells Adam, "For dust you are, and to dust you shall return." The cyclical nature of life and death is a reminder of the limitations of earthly pursuits and the need for a focus on eternal matters.<p><b>What does he gain as he toils for the wind?</b><br>The imagery of "toiling for the wind" conveys the futility and elusiveness of human efforts when they are not grounded in eternal purpose. This echoes the sentiment in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>, where the Preacher observes, "I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and indeed, all is vanity and grasping for the wind." The rhetorical question challenges the reader to consider the ultimate value of their labor and to seek fulfillment beyond material and temporal achievements. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where He advises storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.
