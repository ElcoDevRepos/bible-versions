It echoes the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the complexity of His creation, as seen in passages like <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38-41</a>, where God challenges Job's understanding of the universe. The phrase suggests a comprehensive view, acknowledging that all events and actions are ultimately under God's control.<p><b>and that a man is unable to comprehend the work that is done under the sun.</b><br>This highlights human limitations in understanding divine purposes and the full scope of God's actions. The phrase "under the sun" is a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes, referring to the earthly, temporal realm. It underscores the idea that human wisdom is finite, as also expressed in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are higher than human understanding.<p><b>Despite his efforts to search it out, he cannot find its meaning;</b><br>This reflects the futility of human endeavors to fully grasp God's plans through mere intellectual pursuit. It aligns with the biblical teaching that true wisdom and understanding come from God (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). The phrase suggests that human efforts, no matter how diligent, are insufficient to uncover the divine mysteries.<p><b>even if the wise man claims to know,</b><br>This phrase addresses the presumption of human wisdom. It serves as a caution against pride and self-reliance, reminiscent of the warnings in <a href="/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a>, "Do not be wise in your own eyes." It implies that even those considered wise by worldly standards are limited in their understanding of God's ways.<p><b>he is unable to comprehend.</b><br>The conclusion reinforces the theme of human limitation in the face of divine mystery. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>, where Paul marvels at the depth of God's wisdom and knowledge, acknowledging that His judgments and ways are beyond human comprehension. This phrase serves as a reminder of the need for humility and faith in God's greater plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

Yet exhaustive investigation still hits a wall.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/25-2.htm">Proverbs 25:2</a> balances the tension: &#8220;It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings.&#8221; God invites exploration but reserves ultimate understanding for Himself.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a> clarifies that &#8220;the secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us,&#8221; teaching that revelation and mystery coexist.<p>Bullet points on why human investigation falls short:<p>&#8211; Our perspective is bound by time; God&#8217;s is eternal.<p>&#8211; Our data are incomplete; God&#8217;s knowledge is total.<p>&#8211; Our reasoning is affected by sin; God&#8217;s wisdom is pure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>even if the wise man claims to know, he is unable to comprehend</b><p>Even the most perceptive thinker must yield to divine mystery.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20-25</a> contrasts human wisdom with &#8220;Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God,&#8221; showing that the cross silences pretensions of intellectual self-sufficiency.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-2.htm">1 Corinthians 8:2</a> cautions, &#8220;The one who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-7</a> urges, &#8220;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; &#8230; do not be wise in your own eyes.&#8221;<p>True wisdom bows in humility, acknowledging that final answers lie with God.

The two verses, with their repetitions and tautologous expressions, seem to denote perturbation of mind in the author and his sense of the gravity of his assertions. He is overwhelmed with the thought of the inscrutability of God's judgments, while he is forced to face the facts. An exquisite commentary on this passage is found in Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 1:2. &sect; 2, quoted by Plumptre; and in Bishop Butler's sermon 'On the Ignorance of Man,' where we read, "From it [the knowledge of our ignorance] we may learn with what temper of mind a man ought to inquire into the subject of religion, namely, with what expectation of finding difficulties, and with a disposition to take up and rest satisfied with any evidence whatever which is real. A man should beforehand expect things mysterious, and such as he will not be able thoroughly to comprehend or go to the bottom of.... Our ignorance is the proper answer to many things which are called objections against religion, particularly to those which arise from the appearance of evil and irregularity in the constitution of nature and the government of the world Since the constitution of nature and the methods and designs of Providence in the government of the world are above our comprehension, we should acquiesce in and rest satisfied with our ignorance, turn our thoughts from that which is above and beyond us, and apply ourselves to that which is level to our capacities, and which is our real business and concern .... Lastly, let us adore that infinite wisdom and power and goodness which is above our comprehension (Ecclus. 1:6). The conclusion is that in all lowliness of mind we set lightly by ourselves; that we form our temper to an implicit submission to the Divine Majesty, beget within ourselves an absolute resignation to all the methods of his providence in his dealings with the children of men; that in the deepest humility of our souls we prostrate ourselves before him, and join in that celestial song, 'Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy Name?'
