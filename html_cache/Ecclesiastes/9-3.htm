The term "evil" here refers to the perceived injustice and futility in the world. This reflects the Preacher's (traditionally Solomon) exploration of life's apparent meaninglessness when viewed solely from a human perspective. The "evil" is not moral evil but rather the frustrating reality of life's unpredictability and the seeming lack of divine justice in earthly affairs.<p><b>There is one fate for everyone:</b><br>This phrase underscores the inevitability of death, a central theme in Ecclesiastes. Regardless of one's status, wealth, or righteousness, death is the great equalizer. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:19-20</a>, where humans and animals share the same fate. Theologically, this points to the consequences of the Fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where death entered the world through sin. It also serves as a reminder of the need for a savior, foreshadowing the hope of resurrection and eternal life through Jesus Christ.<p><b>Furthermore, the hearts of men are full of evil and madness while they are alive:</b><br>This statement reflects the biblical view of human depravity, as seen in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>, where every inclination of the human heart is described as evil. The "madness" suggests irrationality and folly, aligning with the wisdom literature's frequent warnings against foolishness. This condition of the heart necessitates divine intervention, pointing to the need for spiritual renewal and transformation, as promised in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises a new heart and spirit.<p><b>And afterward they join the dead:</b><br>The inevitability of death is reiterated, emphasizing the transient nature of life. This phrase highlights the finality of earthly existence and the common destiny of all humanity. In the broader biblical narrative, this points to the hope of resurrection and eternal life found in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>, where in Christ all will be made alive. The joining of the dead also serves as a sobering reminder of the urgency to seek God and live righteously, as life is fleeting and judgment awaits.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

The "evil" is explained in the following words, which speak of the common fate. The Vulgate (followed by Ginsburg and others) lakes the first words as equivalent to a superlative: <span class="accented">Hoc est pessimum inter omnia</span>, "This is the greatest evil of all that is done under the sun." But the article would have been used in this case; nor would this accurately express Koheleth's sentiments. He looks upon death only as one of the evils appertaining to men's career on earth - one of the phases of that identity of treatment so certain and so inexplicable, which leads to disastrous results (<a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That there is one event unto all</span>. The "one event," as the end of the verse shows, is death. We have here the old strain repeated which is found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:14-16</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:19</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>; "Omnes eodem cogimur" (Horace, 'Carm.,' 2:3. 25). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil.</span> In consequence of this indiscriminating destiny men sin recklessly, are encouraged in their wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Madness is in their heart while they live.</span> The "madness" is conduct opposed to the dictates of wisdom and reason, as <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:2, 12</a>. All their life long men follow their own lusts and passions, and care little for God's will and law, or their own best interests. This is well called "want of reason (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, Septuagint). <span class="cmt_word">And after that they go to the dead.</span> The verb is omitted in the Hebrew, being implied by the preposition XXX, "to;" the omission is very forcible. Delitzsch, Wright, and others render, "after him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after man's life is ended, which seems rather to say, "after they die, they die." The idea, however, appears to be, both good and evil go to the same place, pass away into nothingness, are known no more in this world.
