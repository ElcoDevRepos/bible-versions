The author, traditionally believed to be Solomon, is expressing a sentiment that aligns with the theme of vanity and futility found throughout Ecclesiastes. The idea that someone who has not yet existed is "better" highlights the deep sense of despair and disillusionment with the world&#8217;s injustices and sufferings. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the fallen state of the world due to sin, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>is he who has not yet existed</b><br>The notion of not yet existing being preferable underscores the depth of the world's corruption and the pain associated with human life. This echoes Job's lament in <a href="/job/3-11.htm">Job 3:11-16</a>, where he curses the day of his birth. It also resonates with the New Testament teaching in <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22-23</a>, where creation groans for redemption. Theologically, this points to the hope of a future restoration and the ultimate redemption through Christ, who offers eternal life free from the world's present sufferings.<p><b>who has not seen the evil</b><br>The "evil" here refers to the moral and social injustices prevalent in the world. In the context of ancient Israel, this could include oppression, idolatry, and the failure of leaders to uphold God's laws. The biblical narrative consistently portrays God as just and righteous, contrasting with human wickedness. This aligns with the prophetic calls for justice found in books like Isaiah and Amos. The phrase also anticipates the eschatological hope of a new heaven and new earth where evil is no more, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>.<p><b>that is done under the sun</b><br>"Under the sun" is a recurring phrase in Ecclesiastes, emphasizing the earthly, temporal perspective of human life. It suggests a worldview limited to the material and visible, often neglecting the divine or eternal perspective. This phrase captures the essence of Ecclesiastes' exploration of life's meaning apart from God. Theologically, it challenges readers to seek a life oriented towards God, as seen in the teachings of Jesus, who calls His followers to store up treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The phrase also serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly life, urging believers to live with an eternal perspective.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
