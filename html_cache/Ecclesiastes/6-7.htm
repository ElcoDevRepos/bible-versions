In the ancient Near Eastern context, labor was primarily agrarian, with most people working the land to provide food for themselves and their families. This reflects the curse of <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>, where Adam is told he will toil for his food. The emphasis on labor for sustenance is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-26.htm">Proverbs 16:26</a>, which states that a worker's appetite works for him. This phrase underscores the idea that much of human effort is directed toward meeting basic physical needs.<p><b>yet his appetite is never satisfied</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the insatiable nature of human desire. Despite the labor and effort put into acquiring sustenance, there is a deeper longing that remains unfulfilled. This reflects the theme of vanity and futility found throughout Ecclesiastes, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a>, where it is stated that the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. The insatiable appetite can be seen as a metaphor for the human condition, where material and physical pursuits never fully satisfy the soul's deeper needs. This points to the need for spiritual fulfillment, which is ultimately found in Christ, as suggested in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the bread of life, promising that whoever comes to Him will never hunger.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive writings. His reflections in Ecclesiastes often explore the meaning and purpose of life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which Solomon reigned.

From the farmer plowing fields to the employee clocking in at sunrise, Scripture consistently describes work as part of God&#8217;s good&#8212;but fallen&#8212;order (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>; 3:17-19). Consider how other verses echo this reality: <a href="/proverbs/14-23.htm">Proverbs 14:23</a> affirms, &#8220;All hard work brings a profit,&#8221; yet reminds us profit alone cannot fill the deeper needs of the soul. In <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a> Paul insists, &#8220;If anyone is unwilling to work, he shall not eat,&#8221; underscoring personal responsibility. Work, therefore, is necessary, honorable, and God-ordained.<p>Key observations:<p>&#8226; Work provides dignity and purpose (<a href="/ephesians/4-28.htm">Ephesians 4:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Labor teaches stewardship and dependence on God (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Even righteous toil is limited in what it can accomplish for the heart (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is for his mouth</b><p>The next phrase narrows our focus to the most immediate outcome of labor: &#8220;his mouth,&#8221; meaning the basic needs of life&#8212;food, shelter, clothing (cf. <a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-32</a>). God intends work to supply these necessities (<a href="/proverbs/16-26.htm">Proverbs 16:26</a> notes, &#8220;The worker&#8217;s appetite works for him&#8221;). Yet Scripture warns against reducing life to mere consumption. Jesus cautions, &#8220;Do not work for food that perishes, but for food that endures to eternal life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-27.htm">John 6:27</a>).<p>Practical takeaways:<p>&#8226; Earning a living is good, but it is only the starting point.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s provision meets physical needs so we can pursue higher purposes&#8212;loving Him and serving others (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-19</a>).<p>&#8226; When &#8220;the mouth&#8221; becomes the chief aim, we risk idolatry of comfort (<a href="/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Yet his appetite is never satisfied</b><p>Here is the tension: even when labor successfully fills &#8220;the mouth,&#8221; appetite keeps calling. Ecclesiastes earlier observes, &#8220;Whoever loves money never has money enough&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>). Likewise, <a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a> asks, &#8220;Why spend money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not satisfy?&#8221; The human heart, designed for fellowship with God, cannot be filled by material provision alone. Solomon, the author, testifies from experience that wealth, pleasure, and achievement can&#8217;t quench the deeper thirst (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10-11</a>).<p>Truths to remember:<p>&#8226; Physical appetite renews daily; spiritual appetite remains until met in Christ (<a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Endless striving without eternal perspective breeds frustration (<a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Contentment comes from trusting God&#8217;s sufficiency (<a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7</a> exposes the cycle of work, consumption, and lingering desire. God calls us to labor diligently, recognizing His provision meets real needs. Yet the verse warns that if life revolves around satisfying physical cravings, contentment will always stay just out of reach. True fulfillment comes when we see work as a gift, receive daily bread with gratitude, and look beyond the temporal to the One who alone satisfies the soul.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - Section 10. <span class="accented">Desire is insatiable</span>; men are always striving after enjoyment, but they never gain their wish completely - which fortifies the old conclusion that man's happiness is not in his own power. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the labor of man is for his mouth</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for self-preservation and enjoyment, eating and drinking being taken as a type of the proper use of earthly blessings (comp; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>, etc.; <a href="/psalms/128-2.htm">Psalm 128:2</a>). The sentiment is general, and does not refer specially to the particular person described above, though it carries on the idea of the unsatisfactory result of wealth. Luther translates strangely and erroneously, "To every man is work allotted according to his measure. Such an idea is entirely foreign to the context. <span class="cmt_word">And yet the appetite is not filled</span>. The word rendered "appetite" is <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, "soul," and Zockler contends that "' mouth 'and 'soul' stand in contrast to each other as representatives of the purely sensual and therefore transitory enjoyment (comp. <a href="/job/12-11.htm">Job 12:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-26.htm">Proverbs 16:26</a>) as compared with the deeper, more spiritual, and therefore more lasting kind of joy." But no such contrast is intended; the writer would never have uttered such a truism as that deep, spiritual joy is not to be obtained by sensual pleasure; and, as Delitzsch points out, in some passages (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/proverbs/16-26.htm">Proverbs 16:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-8.htm">Isaiah 29:8</a>) "mouth" in one sentence corresponds to "soul" in another. The soul is considered as the seat of the appetitive faculty - emotions, desires, etc. This is never satisfied (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a>) with what it has, but is always craving for more. So Horace affirms that a man rightly obtains the appellation of king, "avidum domando spiritum," by subduing his spirit's cravings ('Carm.,' 2:2. 9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">labor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;mal)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5999.htm">Strong's 5999: </a> </span><span class="str2">Toil, wearing effort, worry, wheth, of body, mind</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[is] for his mouth,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#238;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6310.htm">Strong's 6310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The mouth, edge, portion, side, according to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">yet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;am-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his appetite</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;ne&#183;p&#772;e&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5315.htm">Strong's 5315: </a> </span><span class="str2">A soul, living being, life, self, person, desire, passion, appetite, emotion </span><br /><br /><span class="word">is never</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">satisfied.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1469;&#1488;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;im&#183;m&#257;&#183;l&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4390.htm">Strong's 4390: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fill, be full of</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">OT Poetry: Ecclesiastes 6:7 All the labor of man (Ecclesiast.
