In the context of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher (traditionally understood as Solomon) reflects on the futility of human endeavors and the limitations of human wisdom. The longing for "the old days" can be seen as a form of discontentment with the present, which is contrary to the biblical call to trust in God's sovereignty and provision. Historically, Israel experienced periods of prosperity and decline, such as the reigns of David and Solomon compared to the divided kingdom. This longing for the past can also be seen in the Israelites' complaints during their wilderness journey (<a href="/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a>), where they romanticized their time in Egypt despite its hardships. Theologically, this phrase warns against nostalgia that blinds one to God's work in the present.<p><b>For it is unwise of you to ask about this.</b><br>The wisdom literature of the Bible, including Ecclesiastes, often contrasts wisdom with folly. Here, the Preacher advises that questioning the value of the present compared to the past is unwise. This aligns with the biblical principle of living by faith and not by sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). The admonition suggests that such questions can lead to a lack of gratitude and a failure to recognize God's ongoing work. In the New Testament, Jesus Christ emphasizes the importance of focusing on the present and trusting God for the future (<a href="/matthew/6-34.htm">Matthew 6:34</a>). Theologically, this phrase encourages believers to seek wisdom from God, who grants it generously (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>), and to live with an eternal perspective, understanding that God's purposes transcend human understanding and temporal circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Calling the question &#8220;unwise&#8221; exposes it as more than harmless nostalgia&#8212;it is functional unbelief. Wisdom receives each day as assigned by a sovereign God (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1-11</a>); folly imagines it could allocate times more effectively. &#8220;Teach us to number our days, that we may present a heart of wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>) redirects the focus from bygone days to purposeful living now.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To ask about this</b><p>The issue lies not in remembering the past but in questioning God&#8217;s goodness in the present.

Remembering the past is fine; yearning for it as superior undermines gratitude, cripples present obedience, and ignores the unchanging goodness of God.
