In biblical context, it reflects the creation narrative where God forms man from the dust (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), underscoring the idea that life is a gift from God. The imagery of birth is used throughout Scripture to symbolize new beginnings and the purity of life before the accumulation of worldly possessions and sin.<p><b>so he will depart again</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the inevitability of death, a common theme in Ecclesiastes. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>, where Job acknowledges the transient nature of life. The certainty of death serves as a reminder of human mortality and the futility of earthly pursuits without a focus on eternal values. It also points to the biblical teaching that life is a temporary journey, and one's true home is with God (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>).<p><b>naked as he arrived</b><br>The mention of nakedness at both birth and death highlights the idea that material possessions are ultimately insignificant. This reflects the biblical teaching that earthly wealth cannot be taken into the afterlife (<a href="/1_timothy/6-7.htm">1 Timothy 6:7</a>). The nakedness also symbolizes the purity and vulnerability of the human condition, reminding believers of the need for spiritual clothing, which is found in Christ's righteousness (<a href="/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>).<p><b>He takes nothing for his labor</b><br>This phrase underscores the futility of labor when viewed solely from an earthly perspective. It aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where He advises storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth. The labor mentioned here can be seen as a metaphor for human efforts and achievements, which, without a focus on God, are ultimately meaningless.<p><b>to carry in his hands</b><br>The imagery of carrying something in one's hands suggests possession and control. However, this phrase emphasizes the inability to take material wealth beyond the grave. It serves as a reminder of the biblical principle that true wealth is found in spiritual riches and a relationship with God (<a href="/colossians/3-2.htm">Colossians 3:2</a>). This perspective encourages believers to focus on eternal values and the kingdom of God, rather than temporary, worldly gains.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

Job voiced the same truth: &#8220;Naked I came from my mother&#8217;s womb&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>). Paul repeats it: &#8220;For we brought nothing into the world&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-7.htm">1 Timothy 6:7</a>). These passages remind us:<p>&#8226; Every heartbeat is a gift from the Creator who &#8220;knit me together in my mother&#8217;s womb&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Because God is both Origin and Sustainer, every possession and ability we later enjoy is on loan from Him, not an entitlement.<p>Seeing our entrance into life this way cultivates gratitude rather than presumption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he will depart again</b><p>Death is as certain as birth. &#8220;It is appointed for men to die once&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). Moses prays, &#8220;Teach us to number our days&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>), and Jesus warns the self-confident rich man, &#8220;This very night your life will be demanded of you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a>). Such verses press home two realities:<p>&#8226; No amount of planning, success, or health can delay the moment God calls us home.<p>&#8226; Knowing our exit is sure urges us to steward the in-between years wisely, for &#8220;each of us will give an account of himself to God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Naked as he arrived</b><p>Solomon stresses the vulnerability that bookends life. Just as birth clothes us only in the Creator&#8217;s care, death strips away titles, bank accounts, and achievements. Job repeats the refrain: &#8220;Naked I will depart&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>). Jesus counsels, &#8220;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth&#8230; but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>). The comparison highlights:<p>&#8226; Earthly security is an illusion; eternal security rests in belonging to Christ.<p>&#8226; Inner character, not outer assets, follows us beyond the grave (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He takes nothing for his labor to carry in his hands</b><p>After a lifetime of toil, a person &#8220;cannot take it with him&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/49-17.htm">Psalm 49:17</a>). Solomon earlier observed, &#8220;I must leave it to the man who comes after me&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18</a>). Paul reiterates, &#8220;We can take nothing out&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-7.htm">1 Timothy 6:7</a>). Therefore:<p>&#8226; Labor has value, yet its fruit is temporary unless invested in God&#8217;s purposes.<p>&#8226; Holding possessions loosely frees us to be generous now (<a href="/proverbs/11-24.htm">Proverbs 11:24-25</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The only secure transfer into eternity is treasure laid up through faith and obedience (<a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a> brings us face-to-face with life&#8217;s great equalizers&#8212;birth and death.

Recognizing this:<p>&#8226; Fuels gratitude for every gift.<p>&#8226; Refocuses our efforts toward what outlasts the grave.<p>&#8226; Urges us to hold resources lightly and live for the Lord wholeheartedly, knowing He alone turns temporary labor into eternal reward.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) There is a clear use of <a href="/job/1-21.htm" title="And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.">Job 1:21</a>.
