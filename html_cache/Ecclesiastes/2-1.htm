The speaker, traditionally understood to be Solomon, is engaging in a personal quest for meaning. This introspective approach is consistent with the wisdom tradition, where understanding often begins with self-reflection (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>).<p><b>Come now, I will test you with pleasure</b><br>The speaker decides to explore the value of pleasure as a means to find fulfillment. In the historical context, Solomon, known for his wealth and wisdom, had the resources to indulge in every conceivable pleasure. This testing of pleasure can be seen as an experiment to determine if earthly delights can provide true satisfaction. The pursuit of pleasure is a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes, highlighting the human tendency to seek happiness in material and sensual experiences (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10</a>).<p><b>enjoy what is good!</b><br>This phrase suggests an initial optimism or hope that pleasure might yield something beneficial or worthwhile. The term "good" here can be understood in the context of creation, where God declared His works "good" (Genesis 1). However, the speaker's quest is to discern if such goodness can be found in human pursuits apart from God.<p><b>But it proved to be futile</b><br>The conclusion is one of vanity or futility, a central theme in Ecclesiastes. The Hebrew word "hevel," often translated as "futile" or "vanity," conveys the idea of something transient or insubstantial, like vapor or breath. This reflects the book's overarching message that earthly pursuits, when detached from divine purpose, ultimately lack lasting value. This futility echoes the sentiments found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a>, which speaks to the fleeting nature of human life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects.

Like the rich fool who &#8220;thought to himself&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-17.htm">Luke 12:17-19</a>) and the wicked who &#8220;say in their hearts, &#8216;There is no God&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>), Solomon&#8217;s reasoning spotlights the human tendency to trust personal insight over divine wisdom. His words remind us that:<p>&#8226; Our hearts are naturally self-referential (<a href="/proverbs/28-26.htm">Proverbs 28:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Self-counsel without God quickly drifts toward vanity (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Come now</b><p>This phrase signals urgency and determination, comparable to <a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-15</a> where merchants say, &#8220;Come now, you who say, &#8216;Today or tomorrow we will go&#8230;&#8217; &#8221; Solomon is rallying himself&#8212;much like <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> where the Lord says, &#8220;Come now, let us reason together.&#8221; Yet, unlike the Lord&#8217;s invitation, Solomon&#8217;s call is rooted in personal experiment, not divine command. The tone hints at:<p>&#8226; A confident assumption that he can master life by his own schedule.<p>&#8226; A subtle impatience that brushes aside humble dependence on God (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will test you with pleasure</b><p>Here the king treats his own soul as a laboratory, using pleasure as the instrument. Ecclesiastes later lists wine, great works, servants, silver, and music (2:3-8). This echoes the warning that &#8220;whoever loves pleasure will become poor&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-17.htm">Proverbs 21:17</a>), and it parallels <a href="/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a> where &#8220;the lust of the flesh&#8221; competes with love for the Father. His test teaches:<p>&#8226; Even lawful enjoyments become idols when pressed for ultimate satisfaction (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Pleasure without purpose never quenches the heart&#8217;s deeper thirst (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>; <a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>enjoy what is good!</b><p>Solomon&#8217;s aim is not initially sinful; Scripture affirms that &#8220;every one should eat and drink and find satisfaction&#8221; as God&#8217;s gift (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>; 5:18). Paul agrees: God &#8220;richly provides us with everything to enjoy&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>). The problem arises when enjoyment is severed from the Giver. Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Good things are truly good only within gratitude and obedience (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Pleasure detached from worship becomes a snare (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But it proved to be futile</b><p>The verdict is swift: hedonistic testing fails. &#8220;Futile&#8221; translates the Hebel theme running through the book&#8212;vapor, breath, emptiness. As <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a> notes, minds that pursue created things over the Creator become &#8220;futile.&#8221; Solomon&#8217;s conclusion mirrors:<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/6-8.htm">Galatians 6:8</a>&#8212;&#8220;The one who sows to please his flesh&#8230;reaps corruption.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>&#8212;&#8220;Why spend money on what is not bread?&#8221;<p>No lasting joy arises from pleasures that bypass the fear of the Lord (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Solomon&#8217;s inner conversation exposes the dead-end of chasing pleasure for its own sake. He plans, experiments, and indulges, only to declare it empty. The lesson is clear: true satisfaction is found not in self-directed enjoyment but in receiving every good gift with thankfulness and reverence before God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">In mine heart.--</span>To mine heart (<a href="/luke/12-19.htm" title="And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry.">Luke 12:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/42-11.htm" title="Why are you cast down, O my soul? and why are you disquieted within me? hope you in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.">Psalm 42:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Go to now.--</span><a href="/numbers/22-6.htm" title="Come now therefore, I pray you, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.">Numbers 22:6</a>; <a href="/judges/19-11.htm" title="And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray you, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.">Judges 19:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Enjoy.--</span>Heb., <span class= "ital">see.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - Section 2. <span class="accented">Vanity of striving after pleasure and wealth</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Dissatisfied with the result of the pursuit of wisdom, Koheleth embarks on a course of sensual pleasure, if so be this may yield some effect more substantial and permanent. <span class="cmt_word">I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth.</span> The heart is addressed as the seat of the emotions and affections.
