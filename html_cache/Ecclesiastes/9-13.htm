It suggests a viewpoint limited to the material world, distinct from the divine or eternal perspective. The "wisdom" mentioned here refers to practical, observable insights gained from life experiences. This wisdom is not necessarily divine revelation but rather an understanding of life's complexities and paradoxes. The phrase echoes the book's exploration of human endeavors and the search for meaning in a world that often seems futile and unpredictable.<p><b>and it was great to me:</b><br>The term "great" indicates that the wisdom observed was significant or impressive to the author, traditionally believed to be Solomon. This suggests a recognition of the value and impact of wisdom, even within the limitations of earthly existence. The acknowledgment of wisdom's greatness aligns with the broader biblical theme that true wisdom is a precious and powerful asset (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>). It also reflects the idea that wisdom, though sometimes overlooked or undervalued in a fallen world, holds intrinsic worth and can lead to better understanding and decision-making. This appreciation for wisdom can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament's portrayal of Christ as the embodiment of divine wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

The experience which follows he recognized as an instance of worldly wisdom. To what special event he alludes is quite unknown. Probably the circumstance was familiar to his contemporaries. It is not to be considered as an allegory, though of course it is capable of spiritual application.

Some critics who contend for the Solomonic authorship of our book, see here an allegorical reference to the foreseen revolt of Jeroboam, whose insurrection had been opposed by certain wise statesmen, but had been carried out in opposition to their counsel. Wordsworth considers that the apologue may be illustrated by the history of Jerusalem, when great powers were arrayed against it in the time of Isaiah, and the prophet by his prayers and exhortations delivered it (<a href="/2_kings/19-2.htm">2 Kings 19:2, 6, 20</a>), but was wholly disregarded afterwards, nay, was put to death by the son of the king whom he saved.
