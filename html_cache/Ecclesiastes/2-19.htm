In the biblical context, Solomon, traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, was known for his wisdom, yet he acknowledges that he cannot control the actions of those who come after him. This echoes the biblical theme of human limitation and the unpredictability of life, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/27.htm">Proverbs 27:1</a>, which advises not to boast about tomorrow. The question also highlights the transient nature of human achievements and the potential folly of placing trust in earthly legacies.<p><b>Yet he will take over all the labor at which I have worked skillfully under the sun.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the inevitability of succession and the transfer of one's life work to another. The phrase "under the sun" is a recurring motif in Ecclesiastes, emphasizing the earthly, temporal perspective of human endeavors. Historically, the transfer of power and wealth was a significant concern in ancient monarchies, where the competence of heirs could not be guaranteed. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of stewardship and the temporary nature of earthly possessions, as seen in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where servants are entrusted with their master's wealth.<p><b>This too is futile.</b><br>The conclusion of the verse captures the central theme of Ecclesiastes: the vanity or futility of human efforts when viewed from a purely earthly perspective. The Hebrew word often translated as "futile" or "vanity" is "hevel," which can also mean "breath" or "vapor," suggesting something fleeting and insubstantial. This aligns with the biblical teaching that true meaning and fulfillment are found not in earthly achievements but in a relationship with God, as emphasized in the New Testament (<a href="/philippians/3-7.htm">Philippians 3:7-8</a>). The futility expressed here points to the need for divine wisdom and eternal perspective, foreshadowing the ultimate fulfillment found in Jesus Christ, who offers eternal life and purpose beyond the temporal world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects.
