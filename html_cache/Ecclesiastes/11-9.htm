In biblical context, youth is seen as a period of potential and growth. The Bible frequently acknowledges the vigor of youth, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/20-29.htm">Proverbs 20:29</a>, which contrasts the glory of young men with the splendor of old age. The call to rejoice is not a license for reckless living but an invitation to appreciate the blessings of youth within the boundaries of godly wisdom.<p><b>and let your heart be glad in the days of your youth</b><br>The heart in biblical terms often represents the center of emotions and desires. This phrase suggests that young people should find joy and satisfaction in their youthful days. Culturally, the heart was seen as the seat of decision-making, and this encouragement aligns with the biblical theme of finding joy in God's creation, as seen in <a href="/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>, which advises delighting in the Lord to receive the desires of one's heart.<p><b>Walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the natural inclination of young people to follow their desires and pursue what they see as appealing. However, it also serves as a reminder of the need for discernment. The Bible often warns against following one's heart without guidance, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which describes the heart as deceitful. The phrase suggests a balance between enjoying life and maintaining awareness of spiritual and moral responsibilities.<p><b>but know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment</b><br>This serves as a sobering reminder that all actions, even those taken in youth, are subject to divine judgment. The concept of judgment is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing accountability before God. <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a> reinforces this by stating that God will bring every deed into judgment. This phrase underscores the importance of living a life that honors God, even in the freedom of youth, as ultimately, all will be evaluated by God's righteous standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young_man.htm">The Young Man</a></b><br>Represents youth and the vigor, enthusiasm, and potential that come with it.

Koheleth continues to inculcate the duty of rational enjoyment. "In youth" is during youth; not in the exercise of, or by reason of, thy fresh, unimpaired powers. The author urges his hearers to begin betimes to enjoy the blessing with which God surrounds them. Youth is the season of innocent, unalloyed pleasure; then, if ever, casting aside all tormenting anxiety concerning an unknown future, one may, as it is called, enjoy life. <span class="cmt_word">Let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth.</span> Let the lightness of thy heart show itself in thy bearing and manner, even as it is said in Proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/15-13.htm">Proverbs 15:13</a>), "A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance." <span class="cmt_word">Walk in the ways of thine heart</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/57-17.htm">Isaiah 57:17</a>). Where the impulses and thoughts of thy heart lead thee. The wording looks as if the personal identity, the "I," and the thought were distinct. We have a similar severance in <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a>, only there the personality directs the thought, not the thought the "I," <span class="cmt_word">And in the sight of thine eyes.</span> Follow after that on which thy eyes fix their regard (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10</a>); for, as Job says (<a href="/job/31-7.htm">Job 31:7</a>), "The heart walketh after the eyes." The Septuagint, in deference to the supposed requirements of strict morality, has (at least according to the text of some manuscripts) modified the received reading, translating the passage thus: <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "And walk in the ways of thine heart blameless, and not in the sight of thine eyes." But <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> is omitted by A, C, S. Others besides the Seventy have felt doubts about the bearing of the passage, as though it recommended either unbridled license in youth, or at any rate an unhallowed Epicureanism. To counteract the supposed evil teaching, some have credited Koheleth with stern irony. He is not recommending pleasure, say they, but warning against it. "Go on your way," he cries, "do as you list, sow your wild oats, live dissolutely, but remember that retribution will some day overtake you." But the counsel is seriously intended, and is quite consistent with many other passages which teach the duty of enjoying life as man's lot and part (see <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12, 13, 22</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>, etc.). The seeming opposition between the recommendation here and in <a href="/numbers/15-39.htm">Numbers 15:39</a> is easily reconciled. The injunction in the Pentateuch, which was connected with a ceremonial observance, ran thus: "Remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart, and your own eyes, after which ye used to go a-whoring." Here unlawful pleasures, contrary to the commandments, are forbidden; Ecclesiastes urges the pursuit of innocent pleasures, such as will stand scrutiny. Hoelemann, quoted by Wright, observes that this verse is the origin of a famous student-song of Germany, a stanza or two of which we may cite - <p><span class="foreign">"Gaudeamus igitur, juvenes dum sumus;<br />Post exactam juventutem, post melestam senectutem,<br />Nos habebit humus ....</span> <p><span class="foreign">"Vita nostra brevis est, brevi finietur,<br />Venit mors velociter, rapit nes atrociter,<br />Nemini parcotur."</span> It is not Epicureanism, even in a modified form, that is here encouraged. For moderate and lawful pleasure Koheleth has always uttered his sanction, but the pleasure is to be such as God allows. This is to be accepted with all gratitude in the present, as the future is wholly beyond our ken and our control; it is all that is placed in our power, and it is enough to make life more than endurable. And then to temper unmixed joy, to prove that he is not recommending mere sensuality, to correct any wrong impression which the previous utterances may have conveyed, the writer adds another thought, a somber reflection which shows the religious conclusion to which he is working up. <span class="cmt_word">But know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment</span> (<span class="accented">mishpat</span>). It has been doubted what is meant by "judgment," whether present or future, men's or God's. It has been taken to mean - God will make thy excesses prove scourges, by bringing on thee sickness, poverty, a miserable old age; or these distresses come as the natural consequences of youthful sins; or obloquy shall follow thee, and thou shall meet with deserved censure from thy fellow-men. But every one must feel that the solemn ending of this paragraph points to something more grave and important than any such results as those mentioned above, something that is concerned with that indefinable future which is ever looming in the dim horizon. Nothing satisfies the expected conclusion but a reference to the eternal judgment in the world beyond the grave. Shadowy and incomplete as was Koheleth's view of this great assize, his sense of God's justice in the face of the anomalies of human life was so strong that he can unhesitatingly appeal to the conviction of a coming inquisition, as a motive for the guidance of action and conduct. That in other passages he constantly apprehends earthly retribution, as the Pentateuch taught, and as his countrymen had learned to expect (see <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:26</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17, 18</a>), is no argument that he is not here rising to a higher view. Rather, the fact that the doctrine of temporal reward and punishment is found by experience to fail in many cases (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>) has forced him to state his conclusion that this life is not the end of-everything, and that there is another existence in which actions shall be tried, justice done, retribution awarded. The statement is brief, for he knew nothing more than the fact, and could add nothing to it. His conception of the soul's condition in Sheol (see <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6, 10</a>) seems to point to some other state or period for this final judgment; but whether a resurrection is to precede this awful trial is left in uncertainty here, as elsewhere in the Old Testament. Cheyne and some other critics consider this last clause to be an interpolation, because it appears to militate against previous utterances; but this argument is unreasonable, as the paragraph comes in quite naturally as the needed conclusion, and without it the section would halt and be incomplete. A similar allusion is contained in the epilogue (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). A correcter, who desired to remove all seeming contradictions and discrepancies from the work, would not have been satisfied with inserting this gloss, but would have displayed his remedial measures in other places. Of this proceeding, however, no traces are discernible by an unprejudiced eye. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/11-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Rejoice,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1447;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#601;&#183;ma&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8055.htm">Strong's 8055: </a> </span><span class="str2">To brighten up, be, blithe, gleesome</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O young man,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#363;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_970.htm">Strong's 970: </a> </span><span class="str2">Selected, a youth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">while you are young,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1462;&#1431;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;yal&#183;&#7695;&#363;&#183;&#7791;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
