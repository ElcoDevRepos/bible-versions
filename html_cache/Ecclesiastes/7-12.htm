Wisdom, in biblical terms, is not merely intellectual knowledge but a practical understanding of how to live in accordance with God's will. <a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a> emphasizes the importance of acquiring wisdom, suggesting it is foundational to a righteous life. Just as money can provide physical security and protection from life's uncertainties, wisdom offers spiritual and moral shelter, guiding individuals through life's complexities and challenges. The comparison to money highlights the tangible benefits of wisdom, suggesting it is as essential to life as financial resources.<p><b>and the advantage of knowledge</b><br>Knowledge in the biblical sense often refers to an intimate understanding of God's laws and principles. <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a> warns that a lack of knowledge leads to destruction, underscoring its importance. The advantage of knowledge is that it equips individuals to make informed decisions, discern truth from falsehood, and live in a way that honors God. In the cultural context of Ecclesiastes, where human endeavors often seem futile, knowledge provides a framework for understanding life's purpose and meaning beyond mere earthly pursuits.<p><b>is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner</b><br>The preservation of life through wisdom can be understood both physically and spiritually. <a href="/proverbs/3-21.htm">Proverbs 3:21-22</a> speaks of wisdom and discretion as life to the soul and grace to the neck, indicating that wisdom leads to a life of peace and righteousness. In a historical context, wisdom was often associated with longevity and prosperity, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like Solomon. Spiritually, wisdom preserves life by aligning one's actions with God's will, leading to eternal life through faith. This phrase also echoes the protective nature of wisdom, akin to a fortress that guards against the moral and spiritual dangers of the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship and governance during Solomon's reign, often associated with his rule and the location where he shared his wisdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>The term used for the speaker in Ecclesiastes, often identified with Solomon, who addresses the assembly or congregation with teachings on life and wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_protective_nature_of_wisdom.htm">The Protective Nature of Wisdom</a></b><br>Just as money can provide a temporary shelter from life's difficulties, wisdom offers a more profound and lasting protection.

Throughout Scripture, wisdom is presented as skillful, God-honoring living&#8212;in step with &#8220;the fear of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). Just as Solomon asked for wisdom above riches (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-13</a>), we are reminded here that wisdom is of foundational worth before anything else is compared or valued.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like money</b><p>Money is tangible, immediately recognizable, and universally pursued. By setting wisdom &#8220;like money,&#8221; Solomon is not reducing it to mere currency; he is highlighting how both can be accumulated, stewarded, and used for practical benefit (<a href="/proverbs/13-11.htm">Proverbs 13:11</a>; <a href="/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>). The comparison invites us to see wisdom as something we can &#8220;store up&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1-4</a>) and invest for future gain, just as we would a savings account.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is a shelter</b><p>A shelter provides covering from storms, danger, and scorching heat. Money can buy a roof or insurance, yet &#8220;the rich man&#8217;s wealth is his fortified city&#8221; only in appearance (<a href="/proverbs/18-11.htm">Proverbs 18:11</a>). Wisdom, by contrast, delivers real protection: it guides our choices (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>), restrains destructive impulses (<a href="/proverbs/14-16.htm">Proverbs 14:16</a>), and leads us away from sin&#8217;s traps (<a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>). Under its covering we find the calm assurance described in <a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>&#8212;dwelling &#8220;in the shelter of the Most High.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the advantage of knowledge</b><p>Knowledge expands wisdom&#8217;s reach. While wisdom is right application, knowledge supplies the facts and understanding to which wisdom is applied (<a href="/proverbs/24-3.htm">Proverbs 24:3-4</a>). Together they produce discernment that outperforms mere wealth, guarding us from deceit (<a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>) and equipping us for every good work (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner</b><p>Money may extend life through medicine or comfort, yet it cannot guarantee another heartbeat (<a href="/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19-20</a>). Wisdom, grounded in reverence for God, &#8220;adds years to your life&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/9-11.htm">Proverbs 9:11</a>) because it keeps us within the moral and spiritual boundaries that foster true well-being (<a href="/proverbs/3-21.htm">Proverbs 3:21-26</a>). Ultimately, wisdom points us to Christ, &#8220;who became for us wisdom from God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>), securing not only temporal safety but eternal life (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Solomon sets wisdom alongside money to show that both can offer protection, yet only wisdom provides lasting security. Like accumulated wealth, wisdom can be stored, managed, and deployed&#8212;but unlike wealth, it shelters soul and body, steering us away from ruin and toward life in fellowship with God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">A defence.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">a shadow </span>(<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm" title="He that dwells in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.">Psalm 91:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/121-5.htm" title="The LORD is your keeper: the LORD is your shade on your right hand.">Psalm 121:5</a>, &c).

Symmachus has, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Wisdom shelters as money shelters." The Vulgate explains the obscure text by paraphrasing, <span class="accented">Sieur enirn protegit sapientia</span>, sic <span class="accented">protegit petunia</span>. Shadow, in Oriental phrase, is equivalent to protection (see <a href="/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/17-5.htm">Psalm 17:5</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-20.htm">Lamentations 4:20</a>). Wisdom as well as money is a shield and defense to men. As it is said in one passage (<a href="/proverbs/13-8.htm">Proverbs 13:8</a>) that riches are the ransom of a man's life, so in another (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:15</a>) we are told how wisdom delivered a city from destruction. The literal translation given above implies that he who has wisdom and he who has money rest under a safe protection, are secure from material evil. In this respect they are alike, and have analogous claims to man's regard. <span class="cmt_word">But the excellency</span> - profit, or advantage - <span class="cmt_word">of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it</span>. "Knowledge" (<span class="accented">daath</span>) and "wisdom" (<span class="accented">chokmah</span>) are practically here identical, the terms being varied for the sake of poetic parallelism. The Revised Version, following Delitzsch and others, renders, <span class="accented">Wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. secures him from passions and excesses which tend to shorten life. This seems to be scarcely an adequate ground for the noteworthy advantage which wisdom is said to possess. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> "And the excellence of the knowledge of wisdom will quicken him that hath it." Something more than the mere animal life is signified, a climax to the "defense" mentioned in the preceding clause - the higher, spiritual life which man has from God. Wisdom in the highest sense, that is, practical piety and religion, is "a tree of life to them that lay hold of her, and happy is every one that retaineth her" (<a href="/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>), where it is implied that wisdom restores to man the gift which he lost at the Fall (camp. also <a href="/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>). The Septuagint expression <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> recalls the words of Christ, "As the Father raiseth the dead and quickeneth (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) them, even so the Son also quickeneth whom he will;" "It is the Spirit that quickeneth (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>)" (<a href="/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a>; <a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>). Koheleth attributes that power to wisdom which the more definite teaching of Christianity assigns to the influence of the Holy Spirit.
