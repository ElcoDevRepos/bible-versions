In the biblical context, death is often seen as the ultimate end of earthly suffering, yet here, the bitterness of the situation surpasses even that. This hyperbolic expression emphasizes the severity of the entrapment described. In the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, Solomon frequently warns against the dangers of folly and sin, often personified as a seductive woman (<a href="/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3-5</a>).<p><b>the woman who is a snare</b><br>The imagery of a snare suggests entrapment and deception. In ancient Israel, snares were used by hunters to catch animals, symbolizing cunning and hidden danger. This metaphor aligns with warnings found in Proverbs about the seductive and destructive nature of certain relationships (<a href="/proverbs/7-21.htm">Proverbs 7:21-23</a>). The "woman" here can be understood as a representation of temptation and folly, rather than a literal person, highlighting the spiritual and moral dangers that can lead one away from God.<p><b>whose heart is a net</b><br>A net, like a snare, is a tool for capturing and entangling. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including thoughts, emotions, and will. This phrase suggests that the intentions and desires of this "woman" are designed to entrap and control. The heart's deceitfulness is a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>), warning believers to guard their hearts against such entanglements.<p><b>and whose hands are chains</b><br>Chains symbolize bondage and lack of freedom. This imagery conveys the idea of being held captive by sin and temptation. In the New Testament, Paul speaks of being a slave to sin (<a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>), and this phrase echoes that concept, illustrating the spiritual bondage that results from succumbing to temptation.<p><b>The man who pleases God escapes her</b><br>This part of the verse offers hope and a solution. Pleasing God involves living a life of obedience and righteousness, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like Joseph, who fled from temptation (<a href="/genesis/39-12.htm">Genesis 39:12</a>). The promise of escape suggests divine protection and guidance for those who seek to live according to God's will. It aligns with the New Testament assurance that God provides a way out of temptation (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>).<p><b>but the sinner is ensnared</b><br>The contrast here highlights the consequences of living in sin. The sinner, one who rejects God's ways, becomes trapped by the very temptations they pursue. This reflects the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>). The ensnarement serves as a warning of the spiritual and moral consequences of turning away from God, emphasizing the importance of seeking wisdom and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

The enemy&#8217;s goal is not merely discomfort but complete spiritual ruin (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). Death ends earthly suffering; unrepented sin corrodes both now and forever.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the woman who is a snare</b><p>Here Solomon personifies seductive temptation as &#8220;the woman,&#8221; highlighting how immorality traps the unwary. <a href="/proverbs/7-21.htm">Proverbs 7:21-23</a> paints the same picture: &#8220;With persuasive words she led him astray&#8230; little knowing it will cost him his life.&#8221; Just as an animal cannot escape a hidden trap, so a careless heart is caught by enticement. This warning stands for every form of allure&#8212;sexual, material, or ideological&#8212;that lures a believer away from obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whose heart is a net</b><p>The danger runs deeper than outward allure; it is rooted in intention. A net is designed to entangle many at once. <a href="/judges/16-16.htm">Judges 16:16-20</a> shows Delilah persistently weaving such a net for Samson, until &#8220;his strength left him.&#8221; Temptation often feels personalized, yet its aim is to drag multitudes into compromise. Recognizing the scheming intent helps us stay alert (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and whose hands are chains</b><p>Once the trap is sprung, escape becomes humanly impossible. Chains imply ongoing bondage. Second Peter 2:19 warns, &#8220;For a man is a slave to whatever has mastered him.&#8221; Habitual sin handcuffs the will, dims discernment, and erodes joy. Only God&#8217;s intervention can shatter these restraints, as displayed when Jesus broke the demoniac&#8217;s chains in <a href="/mark/5-4.htm">Mark 5:4-15</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The man who pleases God escapes her</b><p>Deliverance is not accidental; it flows from a life aimed at pleasing the Lord. Joseph fled Potiphar&#8217;s wife because &#8220;How could I do this great wickedness and sin against God?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/39-9.htm">Genesis 39:9-12</a>). <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1-3</a> promises flourishing to the one who delights in God&#8217;s law.

Persisting in rebellion forfeits divine protection; bondage becomes destiny. Yet even here hope remains&#8212;for &#8220;while we were still sinners, Christ died for us&#8221; (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).

Tracing men's folly and madness to their source, he finds that they arise generally from the seductions of the female sex. Beginning with Adam, woman has continued to work mischief in the world. "Of the woman came the beginning of sin," says Siracides, "and through her we all die" (Ecclus. 25:24); it was owing to her that the punishment of death was inflicted on the human race. If Solomon himself were speaking, he had indeed a bitter experience of the sin and misery into which women lead their victims (see <a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1, 4, 11</a>). It may be thought that Koheleth refers here especially to "the strange woman" of <a href="/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>, etc.; Proverbs 5:3, etc.; but in ver. 28 he speaks of the whole sex without qualification; so that we must conclude that he had a very low opinion of them. It is no ideal personage whom he is introducing; it is not a personification of vice or folly; but woman in her totality, such as he knew her to be in Oriental courts and homes, denied her proper position, degraded, uneducated, all natural affections crushed or undeveloped, the plaything of her lord, to be flung aside at any moment. It is not surprising that Koheleth's impression of the female sex should be unfavorable. He is not singular in such an opinion. One might fill a large page with proverbs and gnomes uttered in disparagement of woman by men of all ages and countries. Men, having the making of such apothegms, have used their license unmercifully; if the maligned sex had equal liberty, the tables might have been reversed. But, really, in this as in other cases the mean is the safest; and practically those who have given the darkest picture of women have not been slow to recognize the brighter side. If. for instance, the Book of Proverbs paints the adulteress and the harlot in the soberest, most appalling colors, the same book affords us such a sketch of the virtuous matron as is unequalled for vigor, truth, and high appreciation. And if, as in our present chapter, Koheleth shows a bitter feeling against the evil side of woman's nature, he knows how to value the comfort of married life (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a>), and to look upon a good wife as one who makes a man's home happy (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a>). Since the incarnation of our blessed Lord Jesus Christ, "the Seed of the woman," we have learned to regard woman in her true light, and to assign her that position to which she is entitled, giving honor unto her as the weaker vessel, and, at the same time, heir with us of the glorious hope and destiny of our renewed nature (<a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whose heart is snares and nets</span>; more accurately, <span class="accented">who is snares</span>, <span class="accented">and nets in her heart</span>; Septuagint, "The woman who is a snare, and her heart nets;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quae laqueus venatorum est</span>, <span class="accented">et sagena cot ejus</span>.
