In the context of ancient Israel, genealogies were important, yet the Preacher notes that even these records fade over time. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>, where human life is compared to grass that withers. The historical context of Ecclesiastes, likely written by Solomon, suggests a reflection on the transient nature of human achievements and legacy. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of human mortality post-Fall, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, where humanity is reminded of their return to dust.<p><b>and those yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow after</b><br>This continuation emphasizes the cyclical and repetitive nature of human existence. The future generations, despite their efforts and accomplishments, will also be forgotten. This can be seen as a commentary on the vanity of human endeavors without eternal significance. The cultural context of the ancient Near East, where oral tradition was key, highlights the challenge of preserving memory beyond a few generations. This phrase can be connected to the New Testament teaching in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which describes life as a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. It underscores the importance of seeking eternal values and wisdom, as found in the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The central place of worship and governance during Solomon's reign, often associated with his reflections and teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preacher.htm">The Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>- The voice in Ecclesiastes, often identified with Solomon, who explores the meaning of life and the human condition.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>- The cultural and historical context in which Ecclesiastes was written, providing a backdrop for its themes of wisdom and futility.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/future_generations.htm">Future Generations</a></b><br>- Those who will come after, mentioned in the verse, highlighting the transient nature of human memory and legacy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_human_memory.htm">The Transience of Human Memory</a></b><br>Human achievements and memories are fleeting.

This humbling perspective pushes us to recognize that accolades, monuments, and earthly achievements alone cannot secure lasting significance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And those yet to come</b><p>Solomon widens the lens to future generations. Even the unborn, though they will have their own hopes and plans, are destined to be forgotten in turn. &#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-7</a> portrays all humanity as grass that withers and flowers that fall, stressing that the cycle of fading memory will continue unabated. This recognition guards us from misplaced confidence in the permanence of human legacy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will not be remembered</b><p>The blunt certainty&#8212;&#8220;will not be remembered&#8221;&#8212;cuts against any assumption that time will eventually honor everyone. &#8226; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:16</a> states, &#8220;For the wise man, like the fool, will not be remembered forever,&#8221; proving that intellect or virtue alone cannot shield us from obscurity. Yet Scripture offers a contrasting promise for those who belong to the Lord: <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a> speaks of a &#8220;scroll of remembrance&#8221; written before Him, assuring believers that God never forgets His own.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By those who follow after</b><p>Final emphasis lands on the ones who could have carried the stories forward: the next generation. But even they, Solomon says, will not retain them. &#8226; <a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a> laments that &#8220;another generation arose&#8230;who did not know the LORD,&#8221; illustrating how quickly crucial knowledge can be lost. &#8226; Conversely, <a href="/luke/10-20.htm">Luke 10:20</a> lifts our gaze from earthly memory to heavenly record: &#8220;Rejoice that your names are written in heaven.&#8221; Thus, while human remembrance is fleeting, divine remembrance is eternal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/1-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:11</a> confronts us with the reality that human memory cannot preserve our names or deeds for long. Past, present, and future generations all drift into forgetfulness. This truth dismantles pride in earthly achievements and redirects our hearts toward what God alone records and rewards (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>).

As things are considered novel only because they had been forgotten, so we men ourselves shall pass away, and be no more remembered. Bailey, 'Festus '- <p><span class="accented">"Adversity, prosperity, the grave,<br />Play a round game with friends.

Wright quotes Marcus Aurelius, who has much to say on this subject. Thus: cap. 2:17, "Posthumous fame is oblivion;" cap. 3:10, "Every man's life lies all within the present; for the past is spent and done with, and the future is uncertain;" cap. 4:33, "Those words which were formerly current and proper are now become obsolete and barbarous. Alas l this is not all: fame tarnishes in time, too, and men grow out of fashion as well as language. Those celebrated names of ancient story am antiquated; those of later date have the same fortune; and those of present celebrity must follow. I speak this of those who have been the wonder of their age, and shined with unusual luster; but as for the rest, they are no sooner dead than forgotten" (comp. Wisd. 2:4).
