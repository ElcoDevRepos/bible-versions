In biblical times, swift justice was crucial to maintaining order within society. The Mosaic Law, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15-21</a>, emphasized the need for fair and timely judgment to deter wrongdoing. The delay in executing justice can lead to a breakdown in societal order, as seen in the history of Israel when judges and kings failed to uphold the law. This principle is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/20-8.htm">Proverbs 20:8</a>, where a king who sits on the throne of judgment scatters all evil with his eyes, indicating the power of immediate justice.<p><b>the hearts of men become fully set on doing evil</b><br>This part of the verse addresses the human tendency towards sin when there is a lack of immediate consequences. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of human will and emotion. <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a> describes the heart as deceitful and desperately wicked, suggesting that without restraint, people are inclined to pursue evil. The delay in justice can embolden individuals to continue in sin, as seen in the narrative of the Judges, where Israel repeatedly fell into idolatry and immorality when there was no strong leadership. This concept is also reflected in <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28-32</a>, where God gives people over to a depraved mind when they persist in sin without repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

Without that divine mandate, societies unravel. The verse reminds us that judgment is not optional or merely symbolic; it is necessary for the common good.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is not speedily executed</b><p>Delay erodes deterrence. <a href="/proverbs/20-26.htm">Proverbs 20:26</a> commends swift justice, and <a href="/psalms/94-3.htm">Psalm 94:3-7</a> laments when the wicked &#8220;boast&#8221; because they see no immediate consequence. Even God&#8217;s own delayed judgments&#8212;though always righteous&#8212;are sometimes misunderstood (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9-10</a>), leading scoffers to presume they are safe. Solomon observes the same principle at the human level: when punishment lags, people assume punishment will never come.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the hearts of men</b><p>Scripture diagnoses the heart as &#8220;deceitful above all things&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>) and continually inclined toward evil from youth (<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>). Jesus echoes this in <a href="/mark/7-21.htm">Mark 7:21-23</a>, listing sin&#8217;s ugly offspring that proceed from within. Solomon&#8217;s phrase underlines that the problem is not merely external behavior but an internal disposition that must be restrained.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>become fully set</b><p>The idea is of hardening&#8212;choices congeal into character. <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-28</a> shows how unchecked sin escalates, while <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18-19</a> describes hearts that grow &#8220;callous.&#8221; Each unpunished act cements rebellion, making repentance less likely and future sin more probable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on doing evil</b><p>Unchecked, evil becomes habitual and celebrated (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>). <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a> presents the grim picture of a world where &#8220;every inclination of the thoughts of men&#8217;s hearts was altogether evil all the time.&#8221; Solomon warns that the same trajectory threatens any society that ignores swift, righteous accountability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a> teaches that delayed justice emboldens sinners, because the fallen heart misreads patience as permission.

God seems to us to delay in punishing the guilty because we behold only one little portion of the course of his providence; could we take a more comprehensive view, anomalies would disappear, and we should see the end of these men (<a href="/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a>). But a contracted, skeptical view leads to two evils - first, a weakening of faith in God's moral government; and second, a miserable fatalism which denies man's responsibility and saps his energy. Of the former of these results Koheleth here treats. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the heart of the sons of men.</span> The heart is named as the seat of thought and the prime mover of action (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>; <a href="/esther/7-5.htm">Esther 7:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18, 19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is fully set in them to do evil</span>; literally, <span class="accented">is full in them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their heart becomes filled with thoughts which are directed to evil, or full of courage, hence "emboldened" (Revised Version margin) to do evil. Vulgate, <span class="accented">absque timore ullo filii hominum perpetrant mala</span>; Septuagint, "Because there is no contradiction (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) made on the part of (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) those who do evil speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully persuaded (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) in them to do evil." The long-suffering of God, instead of leading such men to repentance, hardens them in their infidelity (<a href="/psalms/73-11.htm">Psalm 73:11</a>). Primarily, the reference is still to tyrannical despots, who, in their seeming impunity, are em-boldened to pursue their evil course. But the statement is true generally.
