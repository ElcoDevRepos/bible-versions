In the ancient Near Eastern context, naming something was an act of authority and dominion, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19-20</a> when Adam names the animals. This implies that everything in creation is under God's control and has been part of His divine plan from the beginning. The idea that everything was named long ago suggests that God has predetermined the course of history and the nature of all things, aligning with passages like <a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning.<p><b>and it is known what man is</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the limitations and frailty of humanity. In biblical anthropology, humans are seen as created beings with inherent weaknesses, as described in <a href="/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a>, which acknowledges that God knows our frame and remembers that we are dust. The phrase suggests that human nature, with its flaws and limitations, is fully known to God. This understanding is consistent with the biblical theme of human dependence on God, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9-10</a>, where the heart is described as deceitful, yet God searches and knows it.<p><b>but he cannot contend with one stronger than he</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the futility of human efforts to challenge or oppose God. The "one stronger" is often interpreted as God Himself, who is omnipotent and sovereign over all creation. This echoes <a href="/job/9-4.htm">Job 9:4</a>, where Job acknowledges that no one can resist God and prosper. The futility of contending with God is a recurring theme in Scripture, reminding believers of the importance of humility and submission to God's will. It also points to the ultimate victory of God's purposes, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee will bow to Christ, acknowledging His lordship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

The word rendered "already," <span class="accented">kebar</span> (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:10</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:2</a>), "long ago," though used elsewhere in this book of events in human history, may appropriately be applied to the Divine decrees which predetermine the circumstances of man's life. This is its significance in the present passage, which asserts that everything which happens has been known and fixed beforehand, and therefore that man cannot shape his own life. No attempt is here made to reconcile this doctrine with man's free-will and consequent responsibility. The idea has already been presented in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, etc. It comes forth in <a href="/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>, "Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?" (comp. <a href="/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20</a>); <a href="/acts/15-18.htm">Acts 15:18</a> (according to the Textus Receptus), "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world." The same idea is brought out more fully in the following clauses. Septuagint, "If anything ever was, already hath its name been called," which gives the correct sense of the passage. The Vulgate is not so happy, <span class="accented">Qui futurus est</span>, <span class="accented">jam vocatum est nomen ejus</span>, being rather opposed to the grammar. <span class="cmt_word">And it is known that it is man</span>. What is meant by the Authorized Version is doubtful. If the first clause had been translated, as in the margin of the Revised Version, "Whatsoever he be, his name was given him long ago," the conclusion would come naturally, "and it is known that he is man" (<span class="accented">Adam</span>), and we should see an allusion to man's name and to the ground (adamah) from which he was taken (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), as if his very name betokened his weakness. But the present version is very obscure. Cox gives, "It is very certain that even the greatest is but a man, and cannot contend with him," etc. But the Hebrew will not admit this rendering. The clause really amplifies the previous statement of man's predetermined destiny, and it should be rendered, "And it is known what a man shall be." Every individual comes under God's prescient superintendence. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "It is known what man is;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et scitur quod homo sit</span>. But it is not the nature of man that is in question, but his conditioned state. <span class="cmt_word">Neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.</span> The <span class="accented">mightier</span> One is God, in accordance with the passages quoted above from Isaiah, Acts, and Romans. Some consider that death is intended, and that the author is referring to the shortness of man's life. They say that the word <span class="accented">taqqiph</span>, "mighty" (which occurs only in Ezra and Daniel), is never used of God. But is it used of death? And is it not used of God in <a href="/daniel/4-3.htm">Daniel 4:3</a> (3:33, Hebrew), where Nebuchadnezzar says, "How mighty are his wonders"? To bring death into consideration is to introduce a new thought having no connection with the context, which is not speaking of the termination of man's life, but of its course, the circumstances of which are arranged by a higher Power. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>.
