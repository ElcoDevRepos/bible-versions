In the biblical context, wisdom is often associated with a deep understanding of God's will and the ability to make righteous decisions. The Book of Proverbs frequently contrasts wisdom with folly, highlighting its superiority (<a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-18</a>). Historically, wisdom was highly esteemed in ancient Near Eastern cultures, often seen as a divine gift. This echoes the biblical narrative of Solomon, who chose wisdom over wealth or power (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>). The phrase also foreshadows the teachings of Jesus, who often emphasized the importance of spiritual insight over worldly power (<a href="/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>).<p><b>but the wisdom of the poor man is despised,</b><br>This part of the verse reflects a societal tendency to undervalue the insights of those who lack material wealth or social status. In ancient Israel, as in many cultures, wealth was often mistakenly equated with divine favor and wisdom. The poor man's wisdom being despised highlights a recurring biblical theme where God chooses the lowly and humble to convey His truth (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>). This can be seen in the life of Jesus, who was born in humble circumstances and often associated with the marginalized (<a href="/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>, <a href="/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>).<p><b>and his words are not heeded.&#8221;</b><br>The neglect of the poor man's wisdom underscores a broader biblical warning against ignoring God's truth due to prejudice or pride. This is reminiscent of the prophets, who were often disregarded by their contemporaries despite speaking God's word (<a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25-26</a>). The phrase also serves as a cautionary note about the dangers of valuing external appearances over inner truth, a theme echoed in Jesus' teachings (<a href="/john/7-24.htm">John 7:24</a>). The failure to heed wise counsel, regardless of the source, can lead to spiritual and moral downfall, as illustrated throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Scripture often shows God&#8217;s servants stopping to voice discoveries so that readers will slow down and weigh them (<a href="/psalms/49-3.htm">Psalm 49:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1-2</a>).

Yet Scripture consistently honors the humble who fear the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/15-16.htm">Proverbs 15:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>). The contrast exposes a tragic inconsistency: society praises wisdom in theory yet rejects it when packaged in unimpressive form. The same pattern greeted Jesus, who was scorned because of His humble origins (<a href="/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a>).<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Material status is a poor gauge of spiritual insight (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; God often hides treasure in earthen vessels (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his words are not heeded</b><p>Ignoring sound counsel carries real consequences.

The latter part of the verse is not a correction of the former, but the whole comes under the observation introduced by "I said." The story just related leads to this assertion, which reproduces the gnome of <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:19</a>, wherein it is asserted that wisdom effects more than mere physical strength. There is an interpolation in the Old Latin Version of Wisd. 6.
