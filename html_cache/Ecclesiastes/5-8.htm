The Hebrew Bible frequently addresses social justice, emphasizing God's concern for the marginalized (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, <a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>). The "province" suggests a localized area under governance, reflecting the administrative divisions in the ancient Near East. The oppression and denial of justice were systemic issues, often perpetuated by those in power, as seen in the prophetic critiques of Israel's leaders (e.g., <a href="/micah/3.htm">Micah 3:1-3</a>).<p><b>do not be astonished at the matter;</b><br>The admonition not to be astonished suggests that such injustices were, unfortunately, expected in a fallen world. This aligns with the biblical understanding of human nature post-Fall, where sin leads to corruption and injustice (Genesis 3). The wisdom literature often addresses the perplexing nature of evil and suffering, encouraging believers to trust in God's ultimate justice (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><b>for one official is watched by a superior,</b><br>This phrase reflects the bureaucratic hierarchy typical of ancient governance systems, where officials were accountable to those above them. Such structures could lead to corruption, as each level might exploit those below to appease those above. This mirrors the biblical theme of human authority being prone to misuse, contrasting with God's perfect justice (<a href="/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72:1-4</a>).<p><b>and others higher still are over them.</b><br>The layering of authority suggests a complex system where accountability is diluted, often leading to systemic injustice. This can be seen in the historical context of monarchies and empires, where power was concentrated at the top, often resulting in the neglect of the common people. The Bible contrasts human kingdoms with God's kingdom, where righteousness and justice are foundational (<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>). This hierarchy also foreshadows the ultimate authority of Christ, who will establish a kingdom of perfect justice (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressed_poor.htm">The Oppressed Poor</a></b><br>Individuals who suffer under unjust systems and lack the means to defend themselves.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/officials.htm">Officials</a></b><br>Government or authority figures responsible for maintaining justice but often involved in corruption.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_province.htm">The Province</a></b><br>Represents any region or area where governance is exercised, highlighting the universality of the issue.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/higher_officials.htm">Higher Officials</a></b><br>Those in positions of greater authority who oversee other officials, often contributing to systemic corruption.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, offering wisdom on the human condition and governance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_human_governance.htm">Understanding Human Governance</a></b><br>Recognize that human systems are flawed and often corrupt, but God is sovereign over all.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/expecting_injustice.htm">Expecting Injustice</a></b><br>Do not be surprised by injustice; instead, be prepared to respond biblically and righteously.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_accountability.htm">Role of Accountability</a></b><br>Acknowledge the need for accountability at all levels of authority to prevent and address corruption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christian_responsibility.htm">Christian Responsibility</a></b><br>As Christians, we are called to advocate for justice and support the oppressed, reflecting God's heart.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_justice.htm">Trust in God's Justice</a></b><br>Ultimately, trust that God will bring about true justice, even when human systems fail.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ecclesiastes_5_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ecclesiastes 5:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_5_8_on_oppression_justice.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 5:8 address the issue of oppression and justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_oversight_reveal_about_governance.htm">What does "one official watches over another" reveal about human governance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Christian_response_to_injustice_7.htm">How can Christians respond to injustice, as suggested in Ecclesiastes 5:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Eccles_5_8_Rom_13_1-2_on_authority.htm">Connect Ecclesiastes 5:8 with Romans 13:1-2 on authority and governance.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Faith_amidst_corruption_Eccles_5_8.htm">How should believers maintain faith amidst observed corruption, per Ecclesiastes 5:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_5_8_on_injustice.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 5:8 address the issue of injustice and oppression in society?

Yet God has established layers of authority that offer partial restraint and point to His supreme rule. We grieve oppression, work for righteousness, and rest in the certainty that the Highest Authority will one day set all things right.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) The interpretation of this verse depends on the sense we give to "marvel." There are some who take it of simple surprise. "You need not think it strange; the instances of oppression which you observe are only parts of a gigantic scheme of mutual wrong-doing, the oppressors of one being themselves oppressed in turn by their superiors." But instead of "Do not wonder," the meaning "be not dismayed" is preferable. (Comp. <a href="/psalms/48-5.htm" title="They saw it, and so they marveled; they were troubled, and hurried away.">Psalm 48:5</a>; <a href="/job/26-11.htm" title="The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.">Job 26:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm" title="And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travails: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-9.htm" title="And it shall come to pass at that day, said the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.">Jeremiah 4:9</a>.) The verse then supplies the answer to the gloomy view of <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm" title="Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 4:4</a>. In the view that the last clause speaks of the Divine rectification of earthly injustice, I am confirmed by observing that the author of this book delights in verbal assonances, and constantly links together words similar in sound. An English version might admit the meaning: "Over the high oppressor stands a higher, and over both, those who are higher still; "though even here there is the difficulty that the highest of all are spoken of in the plural number, of which it is a very awkward explanation that the "higher" is the king, and that the women and favourites who govern him are the "higher still." But I cannot but think that the language of the Hebrew, that over the <span class= "ital">"geb?h" </span>there be "<span class= "ital">geb?him," </span>is intended to suggest <span class= "ital">Elohim </span>to the reader's mind.<p>On the word "province," see Note, <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm" title="I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>; and on "matter," <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm" title="To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-17.</span> - Section 7. <span class="accented">Perils to which one is exposed in a despotic state</span>, <span class="accented">and the unprofitableness of riches</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - In political life there is little that is satisfactory; yet one must not surrender one's belief in a superintending Providence. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou seest the oppression of the poor</span>. From errors in the service of God, it is natural to turn to faults in the administration of the king (<a href="/proverbs/24-21.htm">Proverbs 24:21</a>). Koheleth has already alluded to these anomalies in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a> and Ecclesiastes 4:1. <span class="cmt_word">Violent perverting</span>; literally, <span class="accented">robbery</span>; <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>so that judgment</span> is never rightly given, <span class="cmt_word">and justice</span> is withheld from applicants. In a province (<span class="accented">me dinah</span>, <span class="accented">Ecclesiastes</span> 2:8); the district in which the person addressed dwells. It may, perhaps, to implied that {his is remote from the central authority, and therefore more liable to be injuriously dealt with by unscrupulous rulers. <span class="cmt_word">Marvel not at the matter</span> (<span class="accented">chephets</span>, <span class="accented">Ecclesiastes</span> 3:1). Be not surprised or dismayed (<a href="/job/26-11.htm">Job 26:11</a>) at such evil doings,, as though they were unheard of, or inexperienced, or disregarded. There is here nothing of the Greek maxim, reproduced by Horace in his "Nil admirari" ('Epist.,' 1:6. 1). It is like St. John's "Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you" (<a href="/1_john/3-13.htm">1 John 3:13</a>); or St. Peter's "Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among' you" (<a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>). The stupid and unintelligent observation of such disorders might lead to arraignment of Providence and distrust in the moral government of God. Against such mistakes the writer guards. <span class="cmt_word">For he that is higher than the highest regardeth.</span> Both the words are in the singular number. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f59;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. One thinks of the Persian satraps, who acted much as the Turkish pashas in later times, the petty rulers oppressing the people, and being themselves treated in the same fashion by their superiors. The whole is a system of wrong-doing, where the weaker always suffers, and the only comfort is that the oppressor himself is subject to higher supervision. The verb (<span class="accented">shamar</span>) translated "regardeth" means to observe in a hostile sense, to watch for occasions of reprisal, as <a href="/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11</a>; and the idea intended is that in the province there were endless plottings and counterplottings, mutual denunciations and recriminations; that such things were only to be expected, and were no sufficient cause for infidelity or despair. "The higher one" is the monarch, the despotic king who holds the supreme power over all these malad-ministrators and perverters of justice. <span class="cmt_word">And there be higher than they</span>. "Higher" is here plural (<span class="accented">gebohgm</span>), the plural of majesty, as it is called (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a>), like <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, the word for "God," the assonance being probably here suggestive. Over the highest of earthly rulers there are other powers, angels, principalities, up to God himself, who governs the course of this world, and to whom we may leave the final adjustment. Who are meant seems purposely to be left undetermined; but the thought of the righteous Judge of all is intimated in accordance with the view of <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a>. This is a far more satisfactory explanation of the passage than that which regards as the highest of all "the court favorites, king's friends, eunuchs, chamberlains," etc. In this view Koheleth is merely asserting the general system of injustice and oppression, and neither accounting for it nor offering any comfort under the circumstances. But his object throughout is to show man's inability to secure his own happiness, and the need of submission to Divine providence. To demonstrate the anomalies in the events of the world, the circumstances of men's lives would be only one part of his task, which would not be completed without turning attention to the remedy against hasty and unfair conclusions. This remedy is the thought of the supreme Disposer of events, who holds all the strings in his hand, and will in the end bring good out of evil. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/5-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you see</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(tir&#183;&#8217;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the oppression</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#353;eq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6233.htm">Strong's 6233: </a> </span><span class="str2">Injury, fraud, distress, unjust gain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the poor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1440;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7326.htm">Strong's 7326: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be in want or poor</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the denial</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1461;&#1448;&#1494;&#1462;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;&#234;&#183;zel)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
