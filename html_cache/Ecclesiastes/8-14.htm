This phrase sets the stage for the observation of life's apparent injustices. The Preacher, traditionally understood to be Solomon, speaks from a perspective of wisdom and experience, observing the world under the sun, a phrase indicating a focus on earthly life apart from divine revelation. This futility is a result of the fallen state of the world post-Genesis 3, where sin introduced disorder and frustration into creation.<p><b>There are righteous men who get what the actions of the wicked deserve:</b><br>This observation highlights the perplexing reality of moral inversion in a fallen world. The righteous, those who live according to God's commandments, sometimes suffer consequences typically associated with wickedness. This echoes the experiences of Job, who suffered despite his righteousness, and foreshadows the ultimate righteous sufferer, Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of the world despite His sinlessness. This inversion challenges the retributive justice system seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are tied to obedience and disobedience.<p><b>and there are wicked men who get what the actions of the righteous deserve:</b><br>Conversely, the wicked, those who live in opposition to God's laws, often prosper and enjoy the blessings that seem due to the righteous. This is a common lament in the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, where the psalmist struggles with the prosperity of the wicked. This reality underscores the tension between the present age and the eschatological hope of divine justice, where God will ultimately set things right, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where God promises to wipe away every tear and eliminate death and suffering.<p><b>I say that this too is futile:</b><br>The Preacher concludes with a reiteration of the futility of these observations, emphasizing the limitations of human understanding and the inability to find ultimate meaning in earthly experiences alone. This statement invites readers to look beyond the temporal and seek wisdom and understanding from God, who alone can provide true justice and meaning. It points to the need for faith in God's sovereign plan, as articulated in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, where all things work together for good for those who love God. This futility also serves as a call to trust in God's ultimate justice and the hope of redemption through Christ, who will one day restore all things.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

The melancholy fact is noted that the righteous often experience that fate with which the wicked are threatened, which their conduct might be expected to bring upon them. The verb translated "happeneth" (<span class="accented">nags</span>), with <span class="accented">el</span>, "to come to," "strike against," is thus used only in later Hebrew, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/esther/9-26.htm">Esther 9:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">According to the work of the righteous.</span> The wicked meet with that outward prosperity and success which were thought to be the special reward of those who served God. The Vulgate is explanatory, "There are just men whom evils befall as if they did the works of the wicked; and there are wicked men who are as free from care as if they had the deeds of the just." Commenting on <a href="/job/34-10.htm">Job 34:10, 11</a>, St. Gregory writes, "It is by no means always the case in this life that God renders to each man according to his work and according to his own ways. For both many who commit unlawful and wicked deeds he prevents of his free grace, and converts to works of holiness; and some who are devoted to good deeds he reproves by means of the scourge, and so afflicts those who please him, as though they were displeasing to him.... God doubtless so ordains it of his inestimable mercy, that both scourges should torture the just, lest their doings should elate them, and that the unjust should pass this life at least without punishment, because by their evil doings they are hastening onwards to those torments which are without end. For that the just are sometimes scourged in no way according to their deserts is shown by this history of Job. Elihu, therefore, would speak more truly if he had said that there is not unmercifulness and iniquity in God, even when he seems not to render to men according to their ways. For even that which we do not understand is brought forth from the righteous balance of secret judgment" ('Moral.,' 24:44). Koheleth ends by repeating his melancholy refrain, <span class="cmt_word">I said that this also</span> (<span class="accented">indeed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>is vanity</span>.
