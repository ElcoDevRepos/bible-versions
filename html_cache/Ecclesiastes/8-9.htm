This phrase emphasizes the experiential nature of the wisdom literature, where personal observation and reflection are key. Solomon, known for his wisdom, had the opportunity to witness the complexities of human behavior and governance firsthand. This aligns with the broader theme of Ecclesiastes, which explores the vanity and fleeting nature of worldly pursuits.<p><b>applying my mind to every deed that is done under the sun</b><br>This phrase highlights the intentional and thorough examination of human actions. "Under the sun" is a recurring phrase in Ecclesiastes, signifying life on earth from a human perspective, often with a focus on the temporal and material aspects. The phrase suggests a comprehensive study of human behavior, echoing the wisdom tradition of seeking understanding and discernment. It also reflects the biblical call to wisdom, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>, where acquiring wisdom is paramount.<p><b>there is a time when one man lords it over another</b><br>This observation points to the misuse of power and authority, a common theme in biblical texts. The phrase can be connected to the warnings against oppression found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16</a> and <a href="/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12-15</a>. It reflects the fallen nature of humanity, where power can lead to tyranny and injustice. Historically, this can be seen in the reigns of various kings in Israel and Judah, where some rulers abused their power, leading to societal decay.<p><b>to his own detriment</b><br>The misuse of power ultimately harms the oppressor, a theme consistent with biblical teachings on justice and righteousness. This phrase suggests that those who exploit others will face consequences, aligning with the principle of reaping what one sows, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. It also echoes the wisdom literature's emphasis on the futility of unjust actions, as they lead to personal and spiritual ruin. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who, in contrast, used His authority for service and sacrifice, embodying the ultimate example of righteous leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

Compare the frank testimony of <a href="/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17&#8211;18</a> and <a href="/psalms/49-13.htm">Psalm 49:13</a>, where the psalmist also &#8220;sees&#8221; the futility of earthly pursuits.<p>&#8226; Scripture never dismisses empirical reality; instead, it uses it to underscore spiritual truth (<a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>applying my mind to every deed that is done under the sun</b><p>Solomon&#8217;s examination is deliberate and comprehensive.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Applying my mind&#8221; shows disciplined, God-given wisdom at work (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Every deed&#8221; underscores that no human action escapes his scrutiny&#8212;politics, commerce, worship, or oppression.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Under the sun&#8221; limits the focus to life within the created order, apart from explicit revelation of eternity.

A new sentence is not commenced here, but the clause is closely connected with what precedes; and "his own hurt" should he "his [equivocally] hurt." Thus Wright and Volck: "All this have I seen, even by applying my heart to all the work that is done under the sun, at a time when man ruleth over man to his hurt." Most modern commentators consider that the hurt is that of the oppressed subject; but it is possible that the sense is intentionally ambiguous, and the injury may be that which the despot inflicts, and that which he has to suffer. Both these have been signified above. There is no valid reason for making, as Cox does, this last clause commence ver. 10, and rendering, "But there is a time when a man ruleth over men to their hurt." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/8-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1462;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2088.htm">Strong's 2088: </a> </span><span class="str2">This, that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have seen,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1433;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">applying</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
