The search for meaning is a central theme in the book, as the author, traditionally identified as Solomon, explores the limitations of human wisdom. The soul's search can be seen as a metaphor for the human condition, constantly seeking fulfillment and truth. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of humanity's quest for God, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>, where the soul longs for God as a deer pants for water.<p><b>Among a thousand I have found one upright man</b><br>The mention of "a thousand" suggests a comprehensive search, indicating the rarity of finding a truly righteous person. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/job/9-3.htm">Job 9:3</a>, where Job acknowledges the difficulty of contending with God even if one were righteous. The "one upright man" can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ, the only truly righteous one, as affirmed in <a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>. The rarity of righteousness among men highlights the fallen nature of humanity and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>But among all these I have not found one such woman</b><br>This phrase has been the subject of much debate and interpretation. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, women often had different societal roles and were not typically included in the same public or legal spheres as men. However, the statement should not be taken as a blanket condemnation of women but rather as a reflection of the author's personal experience and the limitations of his search. It is important to consider other biblical texts that celebrate the virtues of women, such as <a href="/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, which describes the ideal woman as wise, industrious, and God-fearing. The phrase may also serve to emphasize the overall scarcity of righteousness among humanity, rather than making a specific gender comparison.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

Human effort, though valuable, cannot bridge the gap to divine truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Among a thousand I have found one upright man</b><p>Solomon now measures the rarity of righteousness he has personally observed.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/14-2.htm">Psalm 14:2-3</a> states, &#8220;There is no one who does good &#8230; not even one,&#8221; reinforcing the scarcity of genuine uprightness.<p>&#8226; Abraham negotiated with God down to ten righteous people in Sodom (<a href="/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a>) and still came up short; Solomon drives the ratio even lower&#8212;one in a thousand.<p>&#8226; This is not an indictment of every individual man, but a sobering statistic springing from firsthand royal experience: after evaluating countless advisors, officials, and friends, true integrity remained scarce (cf. <a href="/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-6.htm">Proverbs 20:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement exposes humanity&#8217;s universal need for redemption and foreshadows the uniqueness of the perfectly upright Man, Jesus Christ (<a href="/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But among all these I have not found one such woman</b><p>The words may sound harsh, yet they flow from Solomon&#8217;s specific life context rather than a blanket verdict on womankind.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3-4</a> records that Solomon had &#8220;seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines, and his wives turned his heart away.&#8221; In that harem culture, spiritual depth was eclipsed by political alliances and idolatry.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16-19 and 7</a>:26 describe the spiritually destructive influence of immoral companions; Solomon had firsthand experience of those warnings.<p>&#8226; The contrast highlights how sin distorts male and female alike: the issue is not gender but godlessness. Scripture celebrates many godly women&#8212;Ruth (<a href="/ruth/3-11.htm">Ruth 3:11</a>), Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-15.htm">1 Samuel 1:15-18</a>), Abigail (<a href="/1_samuel/25-32.htm">1 Samuel 25:32-33</a>), Esther (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>), Mary (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>). Solomon simply did not encounter such faith among the thousand women bound to him.<p>&#8226; The takeaway is cautionary: intimacy apart from shared devotion to the Lord invites spiritual compromise (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). Solomon&#8217;s confession urges us to choose relationships that strengthen, not weaken, our walk with God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/7-28.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:28</a> portrays Solomon&#8217;s exhaustive yet frustrated search for wisdom and virtue. He discovers that:<p>&#8226; Human inquiry alone cannot secure life&#8217;s answers&#8212;only God can supply them.<p>&#8226; Genuine righteousness is exceedingly rare, underscoring our universal need for the Savior.<p>&#8226; Personal choices, especially in close relationships, profoundly affect spiritual integrity; Solomon&#8217;s own alliances clouded his ability to find godliness among those nearest him.<p>Taken together, the verse warns against self-reliance, highlights the scarcity of true uprightness, and calls us to seek wisdom and companions who direct our hearts toward the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">One man among a thousand.--</span>See <a href="/job/9-3.htm" title="If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.">Job 9:3</a>; <a href="/job/33-23.htm" title="If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man his uprightness:">Job 33:23</a>.
