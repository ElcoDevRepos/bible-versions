The author, traditionally identified as Solomon, speaks from a perspective of experience and observation. The phrase suggests a conclusion drawn from a life of exploration and reflection. In the broader context of Ecclesiastes, this statement acknowledges the limitations of human understanding and the futility of earthly pursuits without divine perspective. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24-25</a>, where the enjoyment of life is seen as a gift from God.<p><b>than to rejoice</b><br>Rejoicing is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with the presence and blessings of God. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, joy was not merely an emotion but a response to God's goodness and faithfulness. This aligns with the teachings found in the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>, which speaks of the fullness of joy in God's presence. The call to rejoice is also a reminder of the temporary nature of earthly life and the importance of finding joy in the present moment, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>, where believers are encouraged to rejoice always.<p><b>and do good</b><br>The exhortation to "do good" reflects the ethical and moral teachings of the Old Testament, particularly the Law of Moses, which emphasized justice, mercy, and righteousness. This phrase underscores the importance of living a life that aligns with God's commandments and reflects His character. The call to do good is echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9-10</a>, where believers are encouraged to not grow weary in doing good. It also points to the life of Jesus Christ, who went about doing good (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>), serving as the ultimate example for believers.<p><b>while they live</b><br>This phrase highlights the temporal nature of human existence and the urgency of living a meaningful life. In the historical context of Ecclesiastes, life was often seen as fleeting and unpredictable, a theme that resonates throughout the book. The emphasis on "while they live" serves as a reminder of the brevity of life, as seen in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which compares life to a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. It encourages readers to make the most of their time on earth by rejoicing and doing good, aligning with the biblical call to live purposefully and in accordance with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

When enjoyment is meant, the phrase used is, as in the next verse, "to see good;" but the context seems to require that this sense should be given to the phrase in this verse also.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I knew</span>, <span class="accented">perceived</span>, <span class="accented">that there was no good for them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for men. From the facts adduced, Koheleth learned this practical result - that man had nothing in his own power (see on Ecclesiastes 2:24) which would conduce to his happiness, but to make the best of life such as he finds it. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Cognovi quod non esset melius nisi laetari</span>. <span class="cmt_word">To do good in his life</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; (Septuagint); <span class="accented">Facere bene</span> (Vulgate). This has been taken by many in the sense of "doing one's self good, prospering, enjoying one's self." like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3cb;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and therefore nearly equivalent to "rejoice" in the former part of the verse. But the expression is best taken here, as when it occurs elsewhere (e.g. <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>), in a moral sense, and it thus teaches the great truth that virtue is essential to happiness, that to "trust in the Lord... to depart from evil, and to do good" (<a href="/psalms/36-3.htm">Psalm 36:3</a>, 27), will bring peace and content (see in the epilogue, <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14</a>). There is no Epicureanism in this verse; the enjoyment spoken of is not licentiousness, but a happy appreciation of the innocent pleasures which the love of God offers to those who live in accordance with the laws of their higher nature. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1429;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there is nothing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">better</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for [men] than</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to rejoice</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1502;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#347;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
