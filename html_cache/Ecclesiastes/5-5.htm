The practice of making vows is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>, where it is stated that a man must not break his word once he has made a vow. The emphasis here is on the seriousness of making a vow to God, highlighting the importance of integrity and the weight of one's words. In the cultural context, vows were not only religious but also social commitments, and failing to fulfill them could lead to a loss of honor and trust within the community.<p><b>than to make a vow</b><br>The act of making a vow was a voluntary commitment, yet once made, it was binding. This phrase underscores the gravity of entering into such a promise. In the biblical context, making a vow was akin to entering into a covenant with God, and it required careful consideration and sincerity. The historical context shows that vows were often made during times of distress or need, as seen in the story of Hannah in <a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>, who vowed to dedicate her son to the Lord if He granted her a child.<p><b>and not fulfill it.</b><br>The failure to fulfill a vow was considered a serious offense, as it was seen as breaking faith with God. <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a> warns against making hasty promises to God, emphasizing that God takes no pleasure in fools who do not keep their vows. This reflects the broader biblical principle that God values truthfulness and faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/20-25.htm">Proverbs 20:25</a>, which warns against making rash vows. Theologically, this can be connected to the nature of God as faithful and true, and the expectation that His people reflect these attributes. In the New Testament, Jesus teaches in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a> to let one's "yes" be "yes" and "no" be "no," further emphasizing the importance of honesty and integrity in one's commitments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.
