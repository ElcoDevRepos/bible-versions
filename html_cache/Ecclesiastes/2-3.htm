Wine in ancient Israel was a common beverage, often associated with joy and celebration (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). However, excessive consumption was warned against (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). The pursuit of pleasure through wine can be seen as a metaphor for seeking satisfaction in worldly things, which ultimately proves to be fleeting.<p><b>and to embrace folly</b><br>The term "folly" here suggests a deliberate engagement in foolishness or senseless activities. In the context of Ecclesiastes, folly contrasts with wisdom, highlighting the author's experiment with living a life devoid of divine purpose. This pursuit of folly is a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes, emphasizing the futility of life without God (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>).<p><b>my mind still guiding me with wisdom</b><br>Despite indulging in folly, the author claims to maintain a level of wisdom. This suggests a conscious awareness and critical evaluation of his actions. The juxtaposition of wisdom and folly underscores the internal conflict and the search for meaning. Wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, often contrasts wisdom with folly, emphasizing the importance of discernment (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>until I could see what was worthwhile for men to do</b><br>This phrase indicates a quest for understanding the purpose of human existence. The author seeks to determine what holds true value in life. This search for meaning is central to Ecclesiastes, as the author examines various aspects of life to find lasting significance (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>).<p><b>under heaven during the few days of their lives</b><br>The phrase "under heaven" refers to life on earth, emphasizing the temporal nature of human existence. The brevity of life is a common theme in Scripture, reminding believers of the importance of living with an eternal perspective (<a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>). The acknowledgment of life's shortness serves as a call to prioritize what truly matters in light of eternity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects.

He is not describing a reckless binge but a purposeful test of pleasure.<p>&#8226; Pleasure as a test of meaning echoes his earlier pursuit of wisdom (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a> reminds us that &#8220;wine makes the heart glad,&#8221; yet <a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> warns that &#8220;wine is a mocker.&#8221; Solomon is putting both truths to the test.<p>&#8226; He treats his body as the immediate recipient of this &#8220;cheer,&#8221; showing that physical sensations alone cannot satisfy a spiritual hunger (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-12.htm">1 Corinthians 6:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to embrace folly</b><p>&#8220;Folly&#8221; here is deliberate light-heartedness, the opposite of solemn reflection.

This phrase occurs again in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-17.htm" title="All his days also he eats in darkness, and he has much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.">Ecclesiastes 5:17</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm" title="For who knows what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spends as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>. We have "men of number" in the sense of "few"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>so few that they can be numbered (<a href="/genesis/34-30.htm" title="And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.">Genesis 34:30</a>, and often elsewhere). So we may translate here "for their span of life." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I sought in mine heart</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I spied out</span> (as <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>) <span class="accented">in my heart</span>. Having proved the fruitlessness of some sort of sensual pleasure, he made another experiment in a philosophical spirit. <span class="cmt_word">To give myself unto wine</span>; literally, to <span class="accented">draw</span> (<span class="accented">mashak</span>) <span class="accented">my flesh with wine</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to use the attraction of the pleasures of the table. <span class="cmt_word">Yet acquainting my heart with wisdom.</span> This is a parenthetical clause, which Wright translates, "While my heart was acting [guiding] with wisdom." That is, while, as it were, experimenting with pleasure, he still retained sufficient control over his passions as not to be wholly given over to vice; he was in the position of one who is being carried down an impetuous stream, yet has the power of stopping his headlong course before it becomes fatal to him. Such control was given by wisdom. Deliberately to enter upon a course of self-indulgence, even with a possibly good intention, must be a most perilous trial, and one which would leave indelible marks upon the soul; and not one person in a hundred would be able to stop short of ruin, The historical Solomon, by his experiment, suffered infinite loss, which nothing could compensate. The Septuagint renders not very successfully, "I examined whether my heart would draw (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) my flesh as wine; and my heart guided me in wisdom." The Vulgate gives a sense entirely contrary to the writer's intention; "I thought in my heart to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might transfer my mind to wisdom." <span class="cmt_word">And to lay hold on folly</span>. These words are dependent upon "I sought in my heart," and refer to the sensual pleasures in which he indulged for a certain object. "Dulce est desipere in loco," says Horace ('Canto.,' 4:12. 28); <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (Theognis, 313). <span class="cmt_word">Till I might see</span>.
