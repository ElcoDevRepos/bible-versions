Children were seen as a source of strength and security, especially in old age. The patriarchs, such as Abraham and Jacob, were promised numerous descendants as part of God's covenant (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5, 28</a>:14). Longevity was also viewed as a blessing, as seen in the lives of the patriarchs and figures like Job (<a href="/job/42-16.htm">Job 42:16</a>). However, the emphasis here is on the futility of these blessings if they do not lead to true fulfillment.<p><b>yet no matter how long he lives, if he is unsatisfied with his prosperity</b><br>The Hebrew concept of "shalom" encompasses peace, completeness, and satisfaction. Despite material wealth or a long life, true contentment is elusive without spiritual fulfillment. This echoes the theme of vanity found throughout Ecclesiastes, where earthly achievements and possessions are ultimately meaningless without a relationship with God (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>). Jesus also taught about the futility of earthly riches without spiritual wealth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>and does not even receive a proper burial,</b><br>A proper burial was of great importance in ancient Israelite culture, signifying honor and respect. The lack of a proper burial was seen as a curse or disgrace (<a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>). This reflects the cultural belief that one's legacy and memory were preserved through burial rites. The dishonor of not being buried properly underscores the ultimate futility of a life focused solely on material gain.<p><b>I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.</b><br>This stark comparison highlights the theme of existential despair found in Ecclesiastes. A stillborn child, who never experiences life, is portrayed as better off than someone who lives a long life without finding true meaning or satisfaction. This echoes Job's lament about the day of his birth (<a href="/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>). The passage challenges readers to consider the value of life beyond material success, pointing towards the need for spiritual fulfillment and the hope found in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>Represents an individual who has achieved what many consider the pinnacle of success&#8212;numerous offspring and a long life&#8212;yet lacks fulfillment and satisfaction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/stillborn_child.htm">Stillborn Child</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to illustrate the futility of a life without satisfaction or goodness, despite external achievements.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon (Implied Author)</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon is reflecting on the vanity of life without God-centered fulfillment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical context in which the text was written, where having many children and a long life were seen as blessings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/proper_burial.htm">Proper Burial</a></b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, a proper burial was a sign of honor and respect, and its absence signifies a lack of fulfillment or honor in life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_earthly_success.htm">The Futility of Earthly Success</a></b><br>Earthly achievements, such as wealth, longevity, and progeny, are ultimately meaningless without spiritual satisfaction and a relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_inner_fulfillment.htm">The Importance of Inner Fulfillment</a></b><br>True satisfaction comes from a life aligned with God's will and filled with His goodness, not merely from external accomplishments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_a_god-centered_life.htm">The Value of a God-Centered Life</a></b><br>A life that seeks God's kingdom and righteousness first will find true fulfillment and purpose, transcending earthly measures of success.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_on_legacy.htm">Reflecting on Legacy</a></b><br>Consider what kind of legacy you are building.

Both were unmistakable signs of success in ancient Israel (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1&#8211;4</a>). Job&#8217;s restoration included &#8220;fourteen sons and three daughters&#8221; and &#8220;long life&#8221; (<a href="/job/42-13.htm">Job 42:13, 17</a>). Yet the verse immediately hints that such abundance, by itself, is not the final measure of a life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No matter how long he lives</b><p>Length of days, even when piled high, cannot by itself deliver meaning. Moses observed, &#8220;The days of our years are seventy, or eighty if we are strong&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>), and James noted that life is &#8220;a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>). Solomon reminds us that endless calendars do not guarantee lasting joy or eternal significance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Unsatisfied with his prosperity</b><p>Here lies the heart of the problem: the man &#8220;is unsatisfied with his prosperity.&#8221; Ecclesiastes has already warned, &#8220;He who loves money is never satisfied with money&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>). Paul later echoes, &#8220;Godliness with contentment is great gain&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6</a>). True satisfaction flows from knowing and honoring the Giver, not from hoarding His gifts. Without that relationship, even heaped-up wealth leaves the heart hollow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Does not even receive a proper burial</b><p>In Solomon&#8217;s culture, an honorable burial was a final testimony of a life well lived (<a href="/genesis/25-9.htm">Genesis 25:9</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>). The absence of such a burial speaks of shame and rejection, like Jehoram who &#8220;departed with no one&#8217;s regret&#8221; and &#8220;was not buried in the tombs of the kings&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-20.htm">2 Chronicles 21:20</a>). Earthly success that ends in scorn underscores how little applause really matters when a life lacks godly substance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A stillborn child is better off than he</b><p>This startling comparison drives the lesson home. A stillborn baby experiences no earthly joys, yet also no prolonged emptiness. Job lamented similarly: &#8220;Why was I not hidden like a miscarriage&#8230; there the wicked cease from turmoil&#8221; (<a href="/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16&#8211;17</a>). Spiritual barrenness makes a long, prosperous life more tragic than a life that never sees the sun. Jesus illustrated the same contrast in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19-31</a>), where temporal luxury without faith ends in eternal loss.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3</a> teaches that abundant family, long years, and overflowing wealth can never replace a heart satisfied in God. Without contentment rooted in Him, life&#8217;s gifts turn hollow, honor evaporates, and even a short, unexperienced life seems preferable. True significance comes from fearing God and keeping His commandments, for &#8220;this is the whole duty of man&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) That a man should be so occupied in the pursuit of riches as never to take any enjoyment from them is a common experience enough; but that the same man should have no sepulchre to preserve his name after him need not necessarily happen, so that one is tempted to think that the Preacher has some actual occurrence in his mind.<p><span class= "bld">Untimely birth.</span>--See references. We have just had another reminiscence of the Book of Job. (See <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm" title="As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a man beget an hundred children</span>.

"Sons,' or "children," must be supplied (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>). To have a large family was regarded as a great blessing. The "hundred" is a round number, though we read of some fathers who had nearly this number of children; thus Ahab had seventy sons (<a href="/2_kings/10-1.htm">2 Kings 10:1</a>), Rehoboam eighty-eight children (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>). Plumptre follows some commentators in seeing here an allusion to Artaxerxes Mnemon, who is said to have had a hundred and fifteen children, and died of grief at the age of ninety-four at the suicide of one son and the murder of another. Wordsworth opines that Solomon, in the previous verse, was thinking of Jeroboam, who, it was revealed unto him, should, stranger as he was, seize and enjoy his inheritance. But these historical references are the merest guesswork, and rest upon no substantial basis. Plainly the author's statement is general, and there is no need to ransack history to find its parallel. <span class="cmt_word">And live many years, so that the days of his years be many</span>; <span class="accented">Et vixerit multos annos</span>, <span class="accented">et plures dies aetatis habuerit</span> (Vulgate). These versions seem to be simply tautological. The second clause is climacteric, as Ginsburg renders, "Yea, numerous as may be the days of his years." The whole extent of years is summed up in days. So <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>, "The days of our years are three score years and ten," etc. Long life, again, was deemed a special blessing, as we see in the commandment with promise (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (<span class="accented">yet if</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his soul not filled with good</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. he does not satisfy himself with the enjoyment of all the good things which he possesses. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> "And his soul shall not be satisfied with his good." <span class="cmt_word">And also that he have no burial.</span> This is the climax of the evil that befalls him. Some critics, not entering into Koheleth's view of the severity of this calamity, translate, "and even if the grave did not wait for him," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "if he were never to die," if he were immortal. But there is no parallel to show that the clause can have this meaning; and we know, without having recourse to Greek precedents, that the want of burial was reckoned a grievous loss and dishonor. Hence comes the common allusion to dead carcasses being left to be devoured by beasts and birds, instead of meeting with honorable burial in the ancestral graves (<a href="/1_kings/13-22.htm">1 Kings 13:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-18.htm">Isaiah 14:18-20</a>). Thus David says to his giant foe, "I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth" (<a href="/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>); and about Jehoiakim it was denounced that he should not be lamented when he died: "He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem" (<a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18, 19</a>). The lot of the rich man in question is proclaimed with ever-increasing misery. Ha cannot enjoy his possessions; he has none to whom to leave them; his memory perishes; he has no honored burial. <span class="cmt_word">I say, that an untimely birth is better than he</span> (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a>). The abortion or still-born child is preferable to one whose destiny is so miserable (see <a href="/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/58-8.htm">Psalm 58:8</a>). It is preferable because, although it has missed all the pleasures of life, it has at least escaped all suffering. The next two verses illustrate this position. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">may father</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3205.htm">Strong's 3205: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bear young, to beget, medically, to act as midwife, to show lineage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a hundred [children]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1441;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3967.htm">Strong's 3967: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hundred</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and live</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1469;&#1495;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7717;&#183;yeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2421.htm">Strong's 2421: </a> </span><span class="str2">To live, to revive</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for many</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(rab&#183;b&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7227.htm">Strong's 7227: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many, great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
