This reflects the experiential nature of Ecclesiastes, where the author shares insights gained through life&#8217;s pursuits. Wisdom, in the biblical sense, is often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>) and is considered a divine gift (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). The comparison to folly highlights the biblical theme of the two paths: the way of wisdom and the way of foolishness (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>). Wisdom is portrayed as superior because it leads to life and understanding, while folly leads to destruction and chaos (<a href="/proverbs/1-32.htm">Proverbs 1:32-33</a>).<p><b>just as light exceeds darkness</b><br>This simile draws on the universal and biblical imagery of light and darkness, where light represents truth, knowledge, and the presence of God (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>), while darkness symbolizes ignorance, evil, and separation from God (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). The contrast between light and darkness is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing the transformative power of divine wisdom and truth. In the New Testament, Jesus is described as the "light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), embodying the ultimate wisdom and truth that dispels the darkness of sin and ignorance. This phrase underscores the inherent superiority and clarity that wisdom provides, much like light illuminating a dark path.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.
