In the ancient Near Eastern context, wealth was often seen as a sign of divine favor. The Bible consistently teaches that all blessings, including material wealth, come from God (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>). This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that God is the ultimate source of all good things (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). The phrase also implies stewardship, as wealth is given by God and should be managed according to His principles.<p><b>and He has enabled him to enjoy them</b><br>Enjoyment of wealth is presented as a divine enablement, suggesting that true contentment and joy in material possessions are gifts from God. This contrasts with the futility often associated with wealth in Ecclesiastes (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:11</a>). The ability to enjoy wealth without it becoming an idol is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing gratitude and contentment (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>).<p><b>to accept his lot</b><br>Accepting one's lot refers to a contentment with one's circumstances, a theme prevalent in Ecclesiastes. This acceptance is not resignation but a recognition of God's sovereignty and provision. It echoes the Apostle Paul's teaching on contentment in <a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-12</a>. The phrase suggests a trust in God's plan and timing, acknowledging that He knows what is best for each individual.<p><b>and to rejoice in his labor</b><br>Rejoicing in labor highlights the value of work and the satisfaction it can bring. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, work was seen as a God-given duty and a means of serving Him (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>). This perspective is reinforced in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to work heartily as for the Lord (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>). The joy in labor is a counter to the often negative view of work as toil and drudgery.<p><b>This is a gift from God</b><br>The concluding phrase underscores the central theme of divine generosity. Everything, including the ability to enjoy wealth and find satisfaction in work, is a gift from God. This reflects the biblical teaching that life and its blessings are not earned but given by God's grace (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). It calls believers to a posture of gratitude and worship, recognizing God's hand in all aspects of life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate giver of all good things, including wealth and the ability to enjoy it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/every_man.htm">Every Man</a></b><br>Represents humanity, specifically those who receive wealth and the ability to enjoy it as a gift from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/riches_and_wealth.htm">Riches and Wealth</a></b><br>Material blessings that are bestowed by God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/labor.htm">Labor</a></b><br>The work or effort that a person engages in, which is also a source of joy when seen as a gift from God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gift_from_god.htm">Gift from God</a></b><br>The concept that both material wealth and the enjoyment of it are divine blessings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_sovereignty.htm">Recognizing God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Understand that all material blessings come from God, and He is sovereign over who receives them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contentment_in_god's_provision.htm">Contentment in God's Provision</a></b><br>Learn to accept your lot in life and find joy in your labor, recognizing it as a gift from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/enjoyment_as_a_divine_gift.htm">Enjoyment as a Divine Gift</a></b><br>Realize that the ability to enjoy wealth and work is not a given but a special grace from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_of_wealth.htm">Stewardship of Wealth</a></b><br>Use your resources wisely, acknowledging that they are entrusted to you by God for His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_and_worship.htm">Gratitude and Worship</a></b><br>Cultivate a heart of gratitude for God's gifts, leading to worship and a deeper relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ecclesiastes_5_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ecclesiastes 5:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Recognizing_God_s_gifts_in_life.htm">How can we recognize God's gifts as described in Ecclesiastes 5:19 in our lives?

As <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a> reminds us, &#8220;Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights.&#8221; Because gifts come from Him, they carry purpose and accountability, echoing David&#8217;s confession that &#8220;riches and honor come from You&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-12.htm">1 Chronicles 29:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>riches and wealth</b><p>The terms cover money, property, opportunities&#8212;anything with value. Scripture never calls these things evil in themselves; the danger lies in loving them (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>). <a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a> clarifies, &#8220;The blessing of the LORD enriches, and He adds no sorrow to it.&#8221; In other words, possessions are safe only when held under His lordship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to every man</b><p>God&#8217;s generosity is broad.

Distribution differs, yet no life is entirely barren of divine provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has enabled him to enjoy them</b><p>The power to enjoy and the possessions themselves are separate gifts. Many have one without the other. Paul urges the wealthy &#8220;to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>). Without that God-given capacity, abundance turns bitter. <a href="/psalms/4-7.htm">Psalm 4:7</a> captures true delight: &#8220;You have filled my heart with greater joy than when grain and new wine abound.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to accept his lot</b><p>Contentment doesn&#8217;t spring from bigger barns but from a settled heart. <a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-12</a> pictures Paul &#8220;content in any and every situation.&#8221; Pair that with <a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6</a>&#8212;&#8220;godliness with contentment is great gain&#8221;&#8212;and we see that acceptance is liberation, not resignation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to rejoice in his labor</b><p>Work is more than a paycheck; it&#8217;s a realm for glad worship. <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a> urges, &#8220;Whatever you do, work at it with your whole being, for the Lord and not for men.&#8221; When labor is offered back to God, <a href="/psalms/128-2.htm">Psalm 128:2</a> comes alive: &#8220;You will eat the fruit of your labor; blessings and prosperity will be yours.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is a gift from God</b><p>The cycle&#8212;receiving, enjoying, accepting, rejoicing&#8212;wraps up as &#8220;a gift from God.&#8221; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a> echoes, &#8220;It is the gift of God that everyone should eat and drink and find satisfaction in all his labor.&#8221; Even salvation itself is called &#8220;the gift of God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>); every lesser gift foreshadows that greater grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/5-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:19</a> anchors our perspective: everything we possess, the capacity to enjoy it, the contentment to rest in it, and the joy to work with it all arrive wrapped in God&#8217;s generosity. When we trace each blessing back to Him, possessions become tools for gratitude, work becomes worship, and life&#8212;whatever the portion&#8212;becomes a stage for praising the Giver.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every man also.</span> The sentence is anacoluthic, like <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>, and may best be rendered, <span class="accented">Also for every man to whom</span>... <span class="accented">this is a gift of God</span>. Ginsburg connects the verse closely with the preceding one, supplying, "I have also seen that a man," etc. Whichever way we take the sentence, it comes to the same tiling, implying man's absolute dependence upon God's bounty. <span class="cmt_word">To whom God hath given riches and wealth</span>. Before he can enjoy his possessions a man must first receive them from God's hands. The two terms here used are not quite synonymous. While the former word, <span class="accented">osher</span>; is used for wealth of any kind whatever, the latter, <span class="accented">nekasim</span>, means properly "wealth in cattle," like the Latin <span class="accented">pecunia</span>, and thence used generally for riches (<span class="accented">volek</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Hath given him power to eat thereof.</span> Abundance is useless without the power to enjoy it. <span class="cmt_word">This is the gift of God</span>, a great and special bounty from a loving and gracious God.
