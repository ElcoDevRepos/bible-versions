In the context of Ecclesiastes, Solomon often emphasizes the temporary nature of human experiences and emotions. Love, hate, and envy are powerful motivators in life, but they cease to exist after death. This aligns with the biblical understanding that earthly life is transient (<a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>). The cessation of these emotions also underscores the futility of living solely for worldly passions, as they hold no eternal value. Theologically, this can be seen as a call to focus on eternal matters rather than temporal ones, echoing Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a> about storing treasures in heaven.<p><b>and they will never again have a share</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the irreversible separation between the living and the dead. Once a person dies, they no longer participate in the activities or experiences of the living world. This separation is a common theme in Scripture, as seen in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19-31</a>), where the rich man is unable to return to warn his brothers. The finality of death serves as a reminder of the importance of making wise and godly choices during one's lifetime. It also points to the hope of resurrection and eternal life for believers, as promised in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52-54</a>.<p><b>in all that is done under the sun</b><br>The phrase "under the sun" is a recurring motif in Ecclesiastes, representing life on earth from a human perspective. It emphasizes the limitations and vanity of earthly pursuits when viewed apart from God. Solomon's exploration of life "under the sun" often leads to the conclusion that without a divine perspective, life can seem meaningless. This phrase invites readers to consider the broader biblical narrative, which offers hope and purpose beyond earthly existence. The New Testament provides a fuller revelation of life beyond "under the sun," particularly through the teachings of Jesus and the promise of eternal life (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom.

All the feelings which are exhibited and developed in the life of the upper world are annihilated (comp. ver. 10).

But all are now at an end. <span class="cmt_word">Neither have they any more a portion forever in any thing that is done under the sun.</span> Between the dead and the living an impassable gulf exists. The view of death here given, intensely gloomy and hopeless as it appears to be, is in conformity with other passages of the Old Testament (see <a href="/job/14-10.htm">Job 14:10-14</a>; <a href="/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10-19</a>; Ecclus. 17:27, 28; Bar. 3:16-19), and that imperfect dispensation. Koheleth and his contemporaries were of those "who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage" (<a href="/hebrews/2-15.htm">Hebrews 2:15</a>); it was Christ who brightened the dark valley, showing the blessedness of those who die in the Lord, bringing life and immortality to light through the gospel (<a href="/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>). Some expositors have felt the pessimistic utterances of this passage so deeply that they have endeavored to account for them by introducing an atheistic objector, or an intended opposition between flesh and spirit. But there is not a trace of any two such voices, and the suggestion is quite unnecessary. The writer, while believing in the continued existence of the soul, knows little and has little that is cheering to say about it's condition; and what he does say is not inconsistent with a judgment to come, though he has not yet arrived at the enunciation of this great solution. The Vulgate renders the last clause, <span class="accented">Nec habent partem in hoc saeculo et in opere quod sub sole geritur</span>. But "forever" is the correct rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, and Ginsburg concludes that Jerome's translation can be traced to the Hagadistic interpretation of the verse which restricts its scope to the wicked The author of the Book of Wisdom, writing later, takes a much more hopeful view of death and the departed (see <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>;
