In the biblical context, wisdom is often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The wise man is not just knowledgeable but possesses discernment and understanding that align with God's will. This echoes Solomon's own request for wisdom from God (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>), highlighting that true wisdom is a divine gift rather than mere human achievement.<p><b>Who knows the interpretation of a matter?</b><br>This phrase suggests the ability to discern and understand complex issues, a skill attributed to those with divine insight. In the Old Testament, figures like Joseph (<a href="/genesis/41-15.htm">Genesis 41:15-16</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/2-27.htm">Daniel 2:27-28</a>) were known for their God-given ability to interpret dreams and mysteries. This ability to interpret is not just intellectual but spiritual, requiring reliance on God for understanding beyond human capability.<p><b>A man&#8217;s wisdom brightens his face,</b><br>Wisdom is portrayed as having a transformative effect, bringing joy and clarity. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a bright face was a sign of favor and blessing (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>). This transformation can be seen as a reflection of inner peace and confidence that comes from living in accordance with divine wisdom. The brightening of the face symbolizes the positive impact of wisdom on one's demeanor and relationships.<p><b>and the sternness of his face is changed.</b><br>The change from sternness to brightness indicates a shift from anxiety or harshness to peace and gentleness. This transformation can be linked to the peace that surpasses understanding, as mentioned in <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>. The wise person, through understanding and trust in God, experiences a change in countenance that reflects inner tranquility and assurance. This change is also a testament to the power of wisdom to alter one's outlook and interactions with others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise_man.htm">The Wise Man</a></b><br>Represents those who possess wisdom, a key theme in Ecclesiastes, often associated with understanding and discernment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_teacher/preacher.htm">The Teacher/Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>Traditionally believed to be Solomon, the author of Ecclesiastes, who reflects on the nature of wisdom and life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience.htm">The Audience</a></b><br>The people of Israel, and by extension, all readers seeking understanding and meaning in life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_context_of_ecclesiastes.htm">The Context of Ecclesiastes</a></b><br>A book of wisdom literature in the Old Testament, exploring themes of life's meaning, the limits of human understanding, and the pursuit of wisdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_transformation_of_the_face.htm">The Transformation of the Face</a></b><br>A metaphorical event indicating the impact of wisdom on a person's demeanor and outlook.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_wisdom.htm">The Value of Wisdom</a></b><br>Wisdom is invaluable and transformative.

There is no use in repining or rebelling; <span class="accented">true wisdom counsels obedience to the powers that be</span>, <span class="accented">and submission to the dispensations of Providence</span>. However oppressive a tyrant may prove sure retribution awaits him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is as the wise man?</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Who is like, equal to, the wise man? The somewhat sudden question occurs naturally after the results of the search for wisdom mentioned at the end of the last chapter. The thought is not, as in <a href="/hosea/14-9.htm">Hosea 14:9</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/9-12.htm">Jeremiah 9:12</a>, "Who is wise?" but - No one Call be compared with a wise man; he has no compeer. <span class="cmt_word">And who</span> [like him] <span class="cmt_word">knoweth the interpretation of a thing?</span> Who, so well as the wise man, understands the proper relation of circumstances, sees into human affairs and God's dispensations in the case of nations and individuals? Such a one takes the right view of life. The word <span class="accented">pesher</span>, "interpretation," occurs (<span class="accented">peshar</span>) continually in Daniel, and nowhere else and is Chaldaic. The Vulgate, which connects these two clauses with <a href="/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7</a>, renders, <span class="accented">Quis cognovit solutionem verbi?</span> So the Septuagint. The "word" or "saying" may be the question proposed above Concerning the happy life, or the proverb that immediately follows. But <span class="accented">dabar</span> is better rendered "thing," as <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, "will enlighten, illuminate." The serene light within makes itself visible in the outward expression; the man is contented arid cheerful, and shows this in his look and bearing. This is an additional praise of wisdom. Thus Ecclus. 13:25, 26, "The heart of man changeth his countenance, whether it be for good or evil. A cheerful countenance is a token of a heart that is in prosperity." Cicero, 'De Orat.,' 3:57, "Omnes enim motus animi suum quemdam a natura habet vultum et sonum et gestum; corpusque totum homiuis et ejus omnis vultus omnesque voces, ut nervi in fidibus, ita sonant, ut motu animi quoque sunt pulsae." <span class="cmt_word">And the boldness of his face shall be changed</span>. The word translated "boldness" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d6;</span>, which means properly "strength," and is best taken of the coarseness and impudence engendered by ignorance and want of culture. Wisdom, when it fills the heart, changes the countenance to an open genial look, which wins confidence and love. Delitzsch refers to the well-worn lines of Ovid, 'Epist.,' 2:9. 47 - <p><span class="foreign">"Adde, quod ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes<br />Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros."</span> The Septuagint, "And a man shameless in countenance will be hated," shows an alteration in the text, and does not agree with the context. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et potentissimus faciem illius commutabit</span>, "And the Almighty will change his face," where again the text is not accurately followed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/8-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1434;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is like the wise man?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1462;&#1443;&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;he&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k, Article &#124;
