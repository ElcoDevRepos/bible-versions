In ancient Near Eastern cultures, leaving a king's presence abruptly could be seen as disrespectful or rebellious. The biblical context emphasizes the importance of wisdom and discernment when dealing with those in power. <a href="/proverbs/25-6.htm">Proverbs 25:6-7</a> similarly advises humility before rulers. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate King, and believers are encouraged to remain in His presence through prayer and obedience.<p><b>and do not persist in a bad cause</b><br>This warns against stubbornly supporting or engaging in actions that are unjust or unwise. Historically, aligning with a bad cause could lead to severe consequences, especially under a monarch's rule. The Bible frequently warns against evil associations and actions, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14-15</a>. This phrase underscores the importance of aligning oneself with righteousness and truth, reflecting the biblical call to pursue justice and avoid sin.<p><b>for he will do whatever he pleases</b><br>This highlights the sovereign power of a king, who has the authority to act according to his will. In the historical context of monarchies, a king's decisions were often final and unquestionable. This can be connected to the sovereignty of God, as seen in <a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>, where God's will is supreme over all creation. It serves as a reminder of the ultimate authority of God, who, unlike earthly kings, is perfectly just and righteous in all His ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Represents authority and power, often seen as a figure of leadership and governance.

Scripture consistently urges humble, respectful engagement rather than abrupt withdrawal (<a href="/proverbs/25-6.htm">Proverbs 25:6-7</a>; <a href="/acts/26-1.htm">Acts 26:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Staying long enough to listen and respond wisely honors the one in authority and ultimately honors the Lord who &#8220;removes kings and establishes them&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p>&#8226; By remaining, we leave room for God to work through proper channels, just as Joseph patiently served under Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14-16, 38</a>-40).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not persist in a bad cause</b><p>&#8226; A &#8220;bad cause&#8221; is any course of action that violates righteousness. Persisting in it reveals stubborn rebellion rather than godly submission (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The call is not to blind obedience but to moral integrity: refuse to prop up evil decisions, yet do so without insolent defiance. Daniel and his friends illustrated this balance when they courteously declined idolatry while still respecting Babylonian authority (<a href="/daniel/3-16.htm">Daniel 3:16-18</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/17-15.htm">Proverbs 17:15</a> warns, &#8220;He who justifies the wicked&#8230;are both detestable to the LORD.&#8221; Stepping away from a sinful agenda safeguards our witness and keeps conscience clear (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For he will do whatever he pleases</b><p>&#8226; Earthly rulers possess real, though limited, power: &#8220;Where the word of a king is, there is power&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/8-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:4</a>). Recognizing that reality keeps us from naive idealism.<p>&#8226; Yet their freedom to act is never outside God&#8217;s sovereign hand. &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is in the hand of the LORD; He directs it like a watercourse&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Therefore, we respond with respectful caution&#8212;neither panicking nor plotting&#8212;trusting God to vindicate obedience in His timing (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-4</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/8-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:3</a> counsels wise interaction with authority: stay engaged rather than storming off, refuse to support wrongdoing, and remember that leaders wield genuine power under God&#8217;s ultimate control. Such balanced, respectful faithfulness preserves integrity and lets the Lord work out His purposes through both just and unjust rulers alike.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) I believe the rendering of our version to be correct, though some have taken it, "Be not hasty: go out of his eight." The best commentary on this verse is <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm" title="If the spirit of the ruler rise up against you, leave not your place; for yielding pacifies great offenses.">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>, which gives the meaning, "When censured by the king, do not abandon the hope of retaining his favour, nor obstinately persist in what he condemns." I do not find adequate proof of the assertion of some commentators, that "go out of his sight" can mean "withdraw allegiance from him," and so that the "evil thing" means a rebellious conspiracy. The advice, "Be not hasty" to rebel, instead of "do not rebel," is inconsistent with the context.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Further advice concerning political behavior. <span class="cmt_word">Be not hasty to go out of his</span> (the king's) <span class="cmt_word">sight</span>. Do not, from some hasty impulse, or induced by harsh treatment, cast off your allegiance to your liege lord. We have the phrase, "go away," in the sense of quitting of service or desertion of a duty, in <a href="/genesis/4-16.htm">Genesis 4:16</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-2.htm">Hosea 11:2</a>. So St. Peter urges servants to be subject unto their masters, "not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward" (<a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>). Solomon might have given this advice to the Israelites who were ready to follow Jeroboam's lead; though they could have remained loyal to Rehoboam only from high religious motives. But it is better to bear even a heavy yoke than to rebel. The Septuagint has, "Be not hasty; thou shalt go from his presence" - which seems to mean, "Be not impatient, and all will be well." But the authorized rendering is correct (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>). We may quote Mendelssohn's comment cited by Chance on <a href="/job/34-16.htm">Job 34:16</a>, "This is a great rule in politics, that the people must have no power to pronounce judgment upon the conduct of a king, whether it be good or bad; for the king judges the people, and not the reverse; and if it were not for this rule, the country would never be quiet, and without rebels against the king and his law." <span class="cmt_word">Stand not in an evil thing</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Neque permaneas in opere malo</span>, "Persist not in an evil affair." But the verb here implies rather the engaging in a matter than continuing an undertaking already begun. The "affair" is conspiracy, insurrection; and Koheleth warns against entering upon and taking part in any such attempt. This seems to be the correct explanation of the clause; but it is, perhaps intentionally, ambiguous, and is capable of other interpretations. Thus Ginsburg, "Do not stand up (in a passion) because of an evil word." Others, "Obey not a sinful command," or "Hesitate not at an evil thing," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. if the king orders it. Wordsworth, referring to <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. renders, "Stand not in the way of sinners," which seems to be unsuitable to the context. The Septuagint gives, "Stand not in an evil word" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span>, perhaps "matter"). The reason for the injunction follows. <span class="cmt_word">For he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</span> The irresponsible power of a despotic monarch is here signified, though the terms are applicable (as some, indeed, take them as alone appertaining) to God himself (but see <a href="/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a>). The Septuagint combines with this clause the commencement of the following verse, "For he will do whatsover he pleases, even as a king using authority (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)."
