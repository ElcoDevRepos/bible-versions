The use of "I saw" indicates a personal insight or revelation, suggesting a deep understanding of human nature. The context of Ecclesiastes is a philosophical exploration of life's meaning, often highlighting the futility of worldly pursuits. The mention of "all labor and success" points to the efforts and achievements that people strive for in life. In the ancient Near Eastern context, labor was often tied to survival and social status, and success was measured by wealth and influence.<br><br>The phrase "spring from a man&#8217;s envy of his neighbor" highlights the motivation behind human efforts. Envy, a destructive emotion, is seen as a driving force for competition and ambition. This reflects the biblical theme of covetousness, as seen in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>), where God warns against desiring what belongs to others. The cultural context of the time was one where social comparison was prevalent, much like today, and this observation remains relevant across ages. The idea that envy leads to labor and success suggests a cycle of dissatisfaction and striving, which is echoed in <a href="/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>, where envy leads to disorder and evil practices.<p><b>This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.</b><br>The phrase "this too is futile" is a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes, where the Preacher often concludes that many human endeavors are meaningless or "vanity." The Hebrew word "hevel," often translated as "futile" or "vanity," conveys the idea of something transient or insubstantial, like a vapor. This reflects the biblical understanding that earthly achievements are temporary and cannot provide ultimate fulfillment.<br><br>The metaphor "a pursuit of the wind" emphasizes the elusive and ungraspable nature of such endeavors. Chasing the wind is an exercise in futility, as it cannot be caught or held. This imagery is used to illustrate the pointlessness of striving for success driven by envy. In a broader biblical context, this can be contrasted with the pursuit of godly wisdom and righteousness, which are portrayed as lasting and fulfilling (<a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-18</a>). The phrase serves as a reminder of the importance of seeking eternal values over temporal gains, aligning with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a> about storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

Kohe-leth says that he reflected upon the industry that men exhibit, and the skill and dexterity with which they ply their incessant toil. There is no reference to moral rectitude in the reflection, and the allusion to the ostracism of Aristides for being called "Just" overshoots the mark (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.).

In the first case the thought is that unusual skill and success expose a man to envy and ill will, which rob labor of all enjoyment. In the second case the writer says that this superiority and dexterity arise from a mean motive, an envious desire to outstrip a neighbor, and, based on such low ground, can lead to nothing but <span class="cmt_word">vanity and vexation of spirit</span>, a striving after wind. The former explanation seems more in accordance with Koheleth's gloomy view. Success itself is no guarantee of happiness; the malice and ill feeling which it invariably occasions are necessarily a source of pain and distress. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
