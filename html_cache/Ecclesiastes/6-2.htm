In the biblical context, riches, wealth, and honor are often seen as signs of God's favor, as seen in the lives of figures like Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>) and Job (<a href="/job/1.htm">Job 1:1-3</a>). However, the emphasis here is on the divine source of these blessings, reminding readers that human effort alone does not guarantee prosperity. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching that God is sovereign over all aspects of life, including material success (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>).<p><b>so that he lacks nothing his heart desires</b><br>This phrase suggests a state of complete satisfaction and fulfillment, reminiscent of the promises found in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, where the Lord is described as a shepherd who provides all needs. The heart's desires in biblical terms often refer to deep-seated longings and aspirations. However, the text implies that even when these desires are met, true contentment may still be elusive, pointing to the limitations of material wealth in providing lasting satisfaction.<p><b>but God does not allow him to enjoy them</b><br>Here, the text introduces a paradox where, despite having everything, the individual is unable to find joy in their possessions. This reflects the theme of divine sovereignty and the transient nature of earthly pleasures, as echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:26</a>. It suggests that enjoyment is also a gift from God, not automatically granted with wealth. This can be seen as a warning against placing ultimate trust in material possessions, which can be fleeting and unsatisfying without God's blessing.<p><b>Instead, a stranger will enjoy them</b><br>This phrase underscores the futility of accumulating wealth for oneself, as it may ultimately benefit others. This idea is echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18-19</a>, where the Preacher laments leaving his labor to someone who did not work for it. Historically, this reflects the instability of wealth in ancient times, where political upheaval or personal misfortune could easily transfer wealth to others. It serves as a reminder of the unpredictability of life and the importance of focusing on eternal rather than temporal treasures (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>This is futile and a grievous affliction</b><br>The conclusion of the verse emphasizes the vanity and sorrow associated with misplaced priorities. The term "futile" is a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes, often translated as "vanity" or "meaninglessness," highlighting the temporary and unsatisfying nature of worldly pursuits. The "grievous affliction" suggests deep emotional and spiritual distress, pointing to the emptiness that can accompany a life focused solely on material gain. This aligns with the broader message of Ecclesiastes, which calls readers to seek fulfillment in God rather than in earthly achievements.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign giver of all things, including riches, wealth, and honor.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>Represents any individual who receives material blessings but is unable to enjoy them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stranger.htm">The Stranger</a></b><br>An unspecified person who ultimately benefits from the man's wealth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, reflecting on the futility of earthly pursuits.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The broader context of the audience who would have been familiar with the themes of blessing and futility.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_source_of_blessings.htm">The Source of Blessings</a></b><br>Recognize that all material blessings come from God, and we are stewards of what He provides.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_wealth_without_enjoyment.htm">The Futility of Wealth Without Enjoyment</a></b><br>Understand that wealth alone does not guarantee happiness or fulfillment; true joy comes from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>Acknowledge God's control over who enjoys wealth and who does not, reminding us of our dependence on Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_misplaced_priorities.htm">The Danger of Misplaced Priorities</a></b><br>Reflect on the importance of prioritizing spiritual wealth over material wealth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_generosity.htm">The Call to Generosity</a></b><br>Use material blessings to bless others, aligning with God's purposes and avoiding the futility of hoarding wealth.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ecclesiastes_6_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ecclesiastes 6:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_6_2_Wealth_s_futility_sans_God.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 6:2 illustrate the futility of wealth without God's blessing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_on_contentment_from_God_s_gifts.htm">What does "God does not enable him to enjoy them" teach about contentment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Align_blessings_with_God_s_purpose.htm">How can we ensure our blessings align with God's purpose, per Ecclesiastes 6:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_6_2_vs_Matthew_6_19-21.htm">Compare Ecclesiastes 6:2 with Matthew 6:19-21 on storing treasures in heaven.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Ecclesiastes_6_2_Spirit_Wealth.htm">How can we apply Ecclesiastes 6:2 to prioritize spiritual over material wealth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_6_2_Divine_justice_issue.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 6:2 challenge the concept of divine justice and fairness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_wealth_honor_but_not_joy.htm">Why does God give wealth and honor but not the ability to enjoy them, as stated in Ecclesiastes 6:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_6_2_on_wealth_s_purpose.htm">What does Ecclesiastes 6:2 suggest about the purpose of material wealth in life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ecclesiastes_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ecclesiastes 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_eccl._6_2_conflict_with_god's_justice.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2 &#8211; Does portraying God as granting riches but withholding enjoyment conflict with the Bible&#8217;s depiction of a just and benevolent deity?

In the supposed case the man is able to procure for himself everything which he wants; has no occasion to deny himself the gratification of any rising desire. All this comes from God's bounty; but something more is wanted to bring happiness. <span class="cmt_word">Yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof.</span> "To eat" is used in a metaphorical sense for "to enjoy," take advantage of, make due use of (see on Ecclesiastes 2:24). The ability to enjoy all these good things is wanting, either from discontent, or moroseness, or sickness, or as a punishment for secret sin. <span class="cmt_word">But a stranger eateth it</span>. The "stranger" is not the legal heir, but an alien to the possessor's blood, neither relation nor even necessarily a friend. For a childless Oriental to adopt an heir is a common custom at the present day. The wish to continue a family, to leave a name and inheritance to children's children, was very strong among the Hebrews - all the stronger as the life beyond the grave was dimly apprehended. Abraham expressed this feeling when he sadly cried, "I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Dammesek Eliezer" (<a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>). The evils are two - that this great fortune brings no happiness to its possessor, and that it passes to one who is nothing to him. <span class="cmt_word">An evil disease</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, Septuagint, an evil as bad as the diseases spoken of in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27, 28</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1441;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
