Wisdom is compared to an inheritance, suggesting its enduring value and the stability it provides. <a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-14</a> also highlights the value of wisdom, likening it to precious jewels. Wisdom, in this sense, is not merely intellectual knowledge but a practical understanding of life that aligns with God's principles. It is a divine gift that guides moral and ethical decisions, much like an inheritance provides material support.<p><b>and it benefits those who see the sun</b><br>The phrase "those who see the sun" refers to the living, emphasizing that wisdom is advantageous in the earthly life. This expression is a poetic way of describing human existence under the sun, a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes that underscores the temporal nature of life. Wisdom benefits the living by offering guidance and insight into navigating life's complexities. In a broader biblical context, <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a> encourages believers to seek wisdom from God, who gives generously. This wisdom is not only practical for daily living but also prepares individuals for eternal life, reflecting the dual benefit of wisdom for both the present and the future.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation where Solomon reigned as king, providing the cultural and historical context for Ecclesiastes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preacher.htm">The Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>The voice in Ecclesiastes, often identified with Solomon, who reflects on the meaning of life and the pursuit of wisdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sun.htm">The Sun</a></b><br>A metaphorical reference to life on earth, representing those who are alive and experiencing the world.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance.htm">Inheritance</a></b><br>A tangible asset passed down from one generation to another, used here as a metaphor for the value of wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_wisdom.htm">The Value of Wisdom</a></b><br>Wisdom is portrayed as a valuable inheritance, suggesting it is both a gift and a responsibility.

It carried security, identity, and continuity for future generations (<a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>).<p>- By pairing wisdom with inheritance, Solomon puts wisdom in the same category of durable, transferrable wealth.<p>- Peter later speaks of an &#8220;inheritance that is imperishable&#8230;reserved in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>); wisdom mirrors that endurance because it comes from the same generous God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is good</b><p>- The simple verdict &#8220;is good&#8221; declares objective value.

The very next verse says, &#8220;For wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>).<p>- Practical payoffs include:<p>&#8226; Guidance that keeps us from destructive paths (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Peaceable relationships, because wisdom is &#8220;gentle&#8221; and &#8220;accommodating&#8221; (<a href="/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Resilience in adversity, offering the same protection that wealth promises, yet without wealth&#8217;s instability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those who see the sun</b><p>- This Hebrew idiom simply means &#8220;the living,&#8221; everyone under the daylight of God&#8217;s created order (<a href="/ecclesiastes/11-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:7</a>).<p>- Wisdom&#8217;s reach, then, is universal; it is not an elite possession but a gift available to every person while they have breath (<a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20-23</a>).<p>- Since life under the sun is often perplexing, the universality of wisdom is a gracious provision for navigating seasons of joy and hardship alike (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a> teaches that wisdom is a lasting, tangible asset, every bit as valuable as a monetary inheritance.

This is putting wisdom on rather a low platform, and one would have expected to read some such aphorism as "Wisdom is better than rubies" (<a href="/proverbs/8-11.htm">Proverbs 8:11</a>), if Koheleth had intended to make any such comparison.
