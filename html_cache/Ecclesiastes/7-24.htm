In the context of Ecclesiastes, the author, traditionally believed to be Solomon, is reflecting on the nature of wisdom and the human experience. The book often contrasts human understanding with divine wisdom, emphasizing the limitations of human knowledge. This aligns with the biblical theme that God's ways and thoughts are higher than ours, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>.<p><b>is out of reach</b><br>The idea here is that certain aspects of life and divine wisdom are beyond human comprehension. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7-9</a>, where the depths of God's wisdom are described as unfathomable. The phrase suggests humility in the face of divine mystery, acknowledging that not all can be understood or controlled by human effort.<p><b>and very deep</b><br>This emphasizes the profound and complex nature of existence and divine wisdom. The depth signifies the vastness and intricacy of God's creation and plans, which are often beyond human understanding. This can be related to <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>, where Paul marvels at the depth of the riches of God's wisdom and knowledge.<p><b>Who can fathom it?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the limitations of human wisdom and understanding. It invites reflection on the mystery of God's creation and the humility required to accept our finite understanding. This is a common theme in wisdom literature, where the pursuit of understanding often leads to the acknowledgment of human limitations, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which advises trust in the Lord over one's own understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Professor Lewis renders, "Far off! the past, what is it? Deep - a deep - oh, who can find?" and explains "the past" to mean, not merely the earthly past historically unknown, but the great past before the creation of the universe, the kingdom of all eternities with its ages of ages, its worlds of worlds, its mighty evolutions, its infinite variety. We prefer to retain the rendering, "that which is," and to refer the expression to the phenomenal world. It is not the essence of wisdom that is spoken of, but the facts of man's life and the circumstances in which he finds himself, the course of the world, the phenomena of nature, etc. These things - their causes, connection, interdependence - we cannot explain satisfactorily (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>).

The Septuagint (and virtually the Vulgate) connects this verse with the preceding, thus: .
