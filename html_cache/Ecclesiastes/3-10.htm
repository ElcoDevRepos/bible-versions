The term "burden" suggests a weight or responsibility that humanity carries. This reflects the human condition post-Fall, where labor and toil became part of life (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>). The burden can also be seen as the quest for meaning and purpose in a world that often seems futile.<p><b>that God has laid</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's sovereignty and the divine origin of life's challenges. It implies that the burdens of life are not random but are part of God's ordained plan. This aligns with the biblical theme that God is in control of all aspects of life (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>, <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>). It also suggests that these burdens serve a purpose in God's greater plan, possibly to draw people closer to Him or to refine their character.<p><b>upon the sons of men</b><br>"Sons of men" is a Hebrew idiom for humanity, emphasizing the universal nature of the human experience. This phrase connects to the biblical understanding that all people, regardless of status or background, are subject to the same existential struggles. It reflects the idea that life's burdens are a common denominator among all people, echoing themes found in Job and Psalms.<p><b>to occupy them</b><br>The purpose of these burdens is to engage or occupy humanity. This suggests that life's challenges are meant to keep people active and perhaps prevent idleness, which can lead to sin (<a href="/proverbs/16-27.htm">Proverbs 16:27</a>). It also implies that through these burdens, people are driven to seek God and find meaning beyond the temporal world. This aligns with the New Testament teaching that trials can produce perseverance and maturity (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

This affirms His absolute sovereignty.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>: &#8220;I form the light and create darkness; I bring prosperity and create calamity.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/3-37.htm">Lamentations 3:37-38</a> reminds us that nothing happens unless the Lord decrees it.<p>Because God lays the burden, it has purpose, not futility.

This burden&#8212;life&#8217;s toil, limitations, and unanswered questions&#8212;comes from the Creator&#8217;s hand. Its universal reach humbles the proud and unsettles the complacent, steering hearts toward the only One who can give rest. Far from meaningless, the burden is a gracious instrument, occupying us until we recognize our need for the eternal God who alone makes everything beautiful in its time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-15.</span> - There is a plan and system in all the circumstances of man's life; he feels this instinctively, but he cannot comprehend it.

We take infinite pains, we entertain ample desires, and strive restlessly to carry them out, but our efforts are controlled by a higher law, and results occur in the way and at the time arranged by Providence. Human labor, though it is appointed by God and is part of man's heritage imposed upon him by the Fall (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>, etc.), cannot bring contentment or satisfy the spirit's cravings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I have seen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the burden</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1506;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1431;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;in&#183;y&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6045.htm">Strong's 6045: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ado, employment, an affair</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has laid</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1447;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7791;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7687;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to occupy them.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6031.htm">Strong's 6031: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be bowed down or afflicted</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm">OT Poetry: Ecclesiastes 3:10 I have seen the burden which God (Ecclesiast.
