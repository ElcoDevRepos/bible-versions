In the context of Ecclesiastes, it underscores the theme of life's fleeting nature and the futility of human endeavors without divine perspective. The Hebrew word for "considers" can also imply deep reflection or contemplation, suggesting that people often live without fully appreciating the brevity of life. This echoes <a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>, which urges believers to "number our days" to gain wisdom. The cultural context of ancient Israel, where life was often uncertain due to factors like war, famine, and disease, would make this reflection particularly poignant.<p><b>because God keeps him occupied</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's active role in human life, providing a sense of purpose and engagement. The word "occupied" suggests a divine intervention that fills a person's life with meaningful activity. This aligns with the biblical view that God is sovereign and intimately involved in the lives of His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>, which states that "the heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps." Theologically, this can be seen as a form of divine grace, where God provides contentment and purpose amidst life's vanities.<p><b>with the joy of his heart</b><br>The joy mentioned here is a gift from God, contrasting with the often pessimistic tone of Ecclesiastes. This joy is not dependent on external circumstances but is a deep-seated contentment that God imparts. In the broader biblical narrative, joy is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) and is often associated with salvation and God's presence (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>). This joy can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate source of joy for believers, as He promises fullness of joy in Him (<a href="/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11</a>). The historical context of Ecclesiastes, likely written during Solomon's reign, a time of prosperity and peace, would make this divine joy particularly relevant as a counterbalance to the material wealth and achievements that might otherwise distract from spiritual fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

The man who has learned the lesson of calm enjoyment does not much concern himself with the shortness, uncertainty, or possible trouble of life. He carries out the counsel of Christ, "<span class="accented">Be</span> not anxious for the morrow, for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof" (<a href="/matthew/6-34.htm">Matthew 6:34</a>). Ginsburg gives an entirely opposite rendering to the clause, "<span class="accented">He</span> should remember that the days of his life are not many;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the thought of the shortness of life should urge us to enjoy it while it lasts. But the Authorized Version is supported by the Septuagint and Vulgate and most modern commentators, and seems most appropriate to the context. The marginal rendering, "<span class="accented">Though</span> he give <span class="accented">not much</span>, yet <span class="accented">he remembereth</span>," etc., which Ginsburg calls a literary curiosity, must have been derived from the version of Junius, which gives, "Quod si non multum (<span class="accented">supple</span>, est illud quod dederit Deus, <span class="accented">ex versu praec</span>.)," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Because God answereth him in the joy of his heart</span>.

God assigns him work that he may thence derive enjoyment; Koster," God makes him sing in the joy of his heart;" Delitzsch, Wright, and Plumptre, "God answers (corresponds with) the joy of his heart," which the latter explains to mean "is felt to approve it as harmonizing, in its calm evenness, with his own blessedness, the tranquility of the wise man mirroring the tranquility of God." But this modified Epicureanism is alien from the teaching of Koheleth. Rather the idea is that God answers him with, imparts to him, joy of heart, makes him sensible of his favorable regard by this inward feeling of satisfaction and content. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/5-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1434;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[a man] seldom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">considers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(yiz&#183;k&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2142.htm">Strong's 2142: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mark, to remember, to mention,   to be male</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his life,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;ay&#183;y&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
