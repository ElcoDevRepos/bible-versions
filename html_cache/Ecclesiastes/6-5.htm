In the ancient Near Eastern context, the sun often symbolized life, vitality, and the passage of time. The child, having never seen the sun, represents a life that never began in the earthly sense. This imagery is used to emphasize the idea that sometimes it is better not to have experienced the burdens and toils of life at all. The concept of "knowing" in biblical terms often implies experiential knowledge, which the child lacks, highlighting the innocence and absence of worldly suffering. This can be connected to <a href="/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>, where Job laments his own birth, wishing he had been like a stillborn child who never saw the light of day.<p><b>has more rest than that man</b><br>The "man" in this context is someone who has lived a life full of toil and dissatisfaction, yet without finding true fulfillment or peace. The term "rest" here implies a state of peace and freedom from the struggles and vanities of life. In biblical literature, rest is often associated with the peace of God and the ultimate rest found in Him, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>, which speaks of a Sabbath rest for the people of God. The comparison suggests that the stillborn child, despite never experiencing life, is in a state of rest that the man, burdened by life's vanities, cannot achieve. This reflects the broader theme of Ecclesiastes, which questions the meaning of life and the pursuit of earthly achievements without a relationship with God. The passage challenges readers to consider the eternal perspective and the true source of rest and fulfillment, which is found in God alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

Scripture treats this little one as a real person&#8212;created by God, possessing dignity, yet never taking a breath in the daylight world. Job voiced a similar thought: &#8220;Or like a stillborn I would not be, like infants who never see the light&#8221; (<a href="/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>). That comparison grounds the discussion in the stark reality that even an unborn life matters to God (<a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13&#8211;16</a>) and can be weighed against the life of an adult.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Though neither seeing the sun</b><p>The stillborn child &#8220;never sees the sun,&#8221; never enjoys the warmth and brightness Solomon often celebrates (<a href="/ecclesiastes/11-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:7</a>). In biblical imagery, sunlight pictures the joys and opportunities of earthly life (<a href="/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>). By stating that the child never experiences even that first sunrise, Solomon highlights how completely the child misses every earthly pleasure, yet the conclusion of the verse will still favor the infant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor knowing anything</b><p>Because life ends in the womb, the child &#8220;knows nothing&#8221; of human achievement, relationships, success, or sorrow. <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a> notes that &#8220;the dead know nothing,&#8221; underscoring the absence of conscious participation in this world. The unborn infant&#8217;s ignorance is total; nevertheless, Scripture teaches that ignorance of earthly toil can actually spare one from vanity and grief (<a href="/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Has more rest</b><p>Remarkably, Solomon insists the child &#8220;has more rest.&#8221; Rest in Scripture speaks of relief from labor and trouble (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>). The stillborn&#8217;s rest is immediate and unbroken&#8212;no striving after wind, no frustration with futility, no endless toil under the sun. In contrast, the prosperous man described in <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:1&#8211;2</a> enjoys material abundance yet cannot &#8220;enjoy the good things God gives,&#8221; so his soul remains restless despite outward success.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Than that man</b><p>&#8220;That man&#8221; refers to the wealthy individual whose prosperity is consumed by strangers and who departs this life unsatisfied (<a href="/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2</a>). Possessions without contentment make his days &#8220;meaningless&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>). Solomon&#8217;s startling conclusion is that a life cut short before it begins is preferable to a long, affluent life devoid of joy in God&#8212;echoing his earlier verdict: &#8220;Better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil done under the sun&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/6-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:5</a> confronts us with a counter-intuitive truth: a stillborn child, though never tasting the smallest delight of earthly life, enjoys deeper rest than a prosperous adult who lacks the God-given ability to savor his blessings. The verse underscores the sanctity of unborn life, the emptiness of wealth without contentment, and the reality that true rest comes not from what we possess or experience but from being freed from the curse of toil and vanity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - It has seen nothing of the world, known nothing of life, its joys and its sufferings, and is speedily forgotten.

The rest that belongs to the abortion is better than that which belongs to the rich man. Others take the clause to say simply, "It is better with this than the other."

Rest, in the conception of an Oriental, is the most desirable or' all things; compared with the busy, careworn life of the rich man, whose very moments of leisure and sleep are troubled and disturbed, the dreamless nothingness of the still-born child is happiness.
