The phrase "good and fitting" suggests a sense of moral and aesthetic appropriateness. In the context of Ecclesiastes, this reflects a pursuit of wisdom and understanding of life's purpose. The Hebrew concept of "good" (&#1496;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;, tov) often implies alignment with God's will, suggesting that what is deemed good is also divinely approved.<p><b>to eat and drink,</b><br>Eating and drinking are basic human activities, symbolizing sustenance and enjoyment. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, meals were communal and often associated with fellowship and celebration. This phrase emphasizes the importance of enjoying God's provisions. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>, where believers are encouraged to do everything for the glory of God, including eating and drinking.<p><b>and to find satisfaction in all the labor one does under the sun</b><br>The phrase "under the sun" is a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes, representing life on earth from a human perspective. The pursuit of satisfaction in labor suggests a divine purpose in work, aligning with the creation mandate in <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>, where Adam is placed in the Garden of Eden to work it. This satisfaction is not merely in the results but in the process, reflecting a contentment that comes from fulfilling one's God-given role.<p><b>during the few days of life that God has given him&#8212;</b><br>This acknowledges the brevity and transience of human life, a theme prevalent throughout Ecclesiastes. The "few days" highlight the temporal nature of earthly existence, reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>, which speaks of the shortness of life. The acknowledgment that life is given by God underscores His sovereignty and the grace inherent in each day.<p><b>for this is his lot.</b><br>The term "lot" refers to one's portion or destiny, suggesting a divinely appointed path. This reflects the biblical understanding that God assigns each person their circumstances and responsibilities. It aligns with the idea in <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>, where the lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord. This phrase encourages acceptance and contentment with one's God-given circumstances, trusting in His wisdom and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>- The nation over which Solomon reigned, providing the cultural and historical context for Ecclesiastes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/labor.htm">Labor</a></b><br>- Represents the work and toil of human life, a central theme in Ecclesiastes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The sovereign Creator who gives life and assigns each person's lot.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/under_the_sun.htm">Under the Sun</a></b><br>- A phrase used throughout Ecclesiastes to describe life on earth, emphasizing the temporal and often futile nature of worldly pursuits.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/contentment_in_god's_provision.htm">Contentment in God's Provision</a></b><br>Recognize that satisfaction in life is a gift from God.

The inconveniences of wealth lead the writer back to his old conclusion, that <span class="accented">man</span> <span class="accented">should make the best of life</span>, <span class="accented">and enjoy all the good that God gives with moderation and contentment</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely</span>, etc. The accentuation is against this rendering, which, however, has the support of the Syriac and the Targum. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">Behold</span>, I have seen a good which is comely;" and it is best to translate, with Delitzsch and others, "Behold, what I have seen as good, what as beautiful, is this." My conclusion holds good. They who seek for traces of Greek influence in Koheleth find Epicureanism in the sentiment, and the familiar combination, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, in the language. Both ideas are baseless. (For supposed Epicureanism, see on Ecclesiastes 2:24 and Ecclesiastes 3:12.) And the juxtaposition of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is only a fortuitous rendering of the Hebrew, upon which no argument for Grecism can be founded. <span class="cmt_word">To eat and to drink</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to use the common blessings which God bestows with thankfulness and contentment. As St. Paul says, "Having food and covering, we shall he therewith content" (<a href="/1_timothy/6-8.htm">1 Timothy 6:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which God giveth him</span>. This is the point so often insisted upon. These temporal blessings are God's gifts, and are not to be considered as the natural and assured result of man's own exertions. Man, indeed, must labor, but God giveth the increase. <span class="cmt_word">For it is his portion</span> (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>). This calm enjoyment is allotted to man by God, and nothing more must be expected. Ben-Sira gives similar advice, "Defraud not thyself of a good day, and let not the share in a right pleasure pass by thee Give, and take, and beguile thy soul; for there is no seeking of dainties in Hades" (Ecclus. 14:14. etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Here</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1438;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have seen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to be good</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and fitting:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;p&#772;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3303.htm">Strong's 3303: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fair, beautiful</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1462;&#1469;&#1488;&#1462;&#1499;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(le&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;wl-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
