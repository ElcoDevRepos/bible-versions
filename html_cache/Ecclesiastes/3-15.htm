It suggests that human experiences and events are not new but have occurred before. This echoes the idea found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a>, "There is nothing new under the sun." Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty and the repetitive patterns of human behavior and history. This concept can be seen in the recurring cycles of sin and redemption throughout the Old Testament, such as the Israelites' repeated turning away from and returning to God.<p><b>and what will be has already been</b><br>This continuation emphasizes the timelessness of God's plan and the predictability of human nature. It suggests that future events are not unknown to God and have, in a sense, already occurred in His divine foreknowledge. This aligns with the biblical understanding of God's omniscience, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning. It also points to the prophetic nature of Scripture, where future events are often foreshadowed or prefigured in past events, such as the typology of Christ in the Old Testament sacrificial system.<p><b>for God will call to account what has passed</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of divine judgment and accountability. It implies that God, in His justice, will review and judge past actions. This is consistent with the biblical theme of judgment found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>, where it states that each person will give an account of themselves to God. It also reflects the moral order established by God, where actions have consequences, and justice will ultimately be served. This assurance of divine accountability provides hope for believers, as it affirms that God will right all wrongs and bring about His righteous purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The writer has not been speaking of the bringing the past into judgment, but of the immutable order of the universe, which constantly repeats itself. But it would seem that the word suggesting the thought of seeking for the purpose of judgment leads on to the next topic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That which hath been is now</span>; so Septuagint; "That which hath been made, the same remaineth" (Vulgate); better, <span class="accented">that which hath been</span>, <span class="accented">long ago it is</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. was in existence long before. The thought is much the same as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a>, only here it is adduced not to prove the vanity and endless sameness of circumstances, but the orderly and appointed succession of events under the controlling providence of God. <span class="cmt_word">That which is to be hath already been</span>. The future will be a reproduction of the past. The laws which regulate things change not; the moral government is exercised by him who "is, and was, and is to come" (<a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>), and therefore in effect history repeats itself; the same causes produce the same phenomena. <span class="cmt_word">God requireth that which is past</span>; literally, <span class="accented">God seeketh after that which hath been chased away</span>; Septuagint, "God will seek him who is pursued (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>);" Vulgate, "God reneweth that which is passed (<span class="accented">instaurat quod abiit</span>)." The meaning is - God brings back to view, recalls again into being, that which was past and had vanished out of sight and mind. The sentence is an explanation of the preceding clauses, and has nothing to do with the inquisition at the day of judgment. Hengstenberg has followed the Septuagint, Syriac, and Targum, in translating, "God seeks the persecuted," and seeing herein an allusion to the punishment of the Egyptians for pursuing the Israelites to the Red Sea, or a general statement that God succors the oppressed. But this idea is quite alien to the intention of the passage, and injures the coherence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">What exists</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has already</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3528.htm">Strong's 3528: </a> </span><span class="str2">Extent of time, a great while, long ago, formerly, hitherto</span><br /><br /><span class="word">been,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;e&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative &#124;
