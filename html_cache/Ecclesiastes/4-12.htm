In the ancient Near Eastern context, traveling alone was perilous due to the threat of bandits and wild animals. The Bible often emphasizes the importance of community and mutual support, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a>, "As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another." This reflects the broader biblical theme of the strength found in companionship and the dangers of isolation.<p><b>two can resist</b><br>The idea of two people being able to resist an adversary underscores the strength found in partnership. This concept is echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who sent His disciples out in pairs (<a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>), emphasizing the importance of mutual support in ministry. The historical context of ancient Israel, where alliances and partnerships were crucial for survival, further illustrates the practical wisdom of this statement. Ecclesiastes often reflects on the benefits of companionship, as seen earlier in the chapter with the advantages of two people working together.<p><b>Moreover, a cord of three strands is not quickly broken</b><br>This metaphor illustrates the increased strength and resilience found in unity. The imagery of a threefold cord suggests a completeness and stability that surpasses a single or even a double strand. In biblical symbolism, the number three often represents completeness or divine perfection, as seen in the Trinity. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, where the presence of God in a relationship or community adds an unbreakable strength. The principle of unity is further supported by Jesus' prayer for His followers to be one (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>), highlighting the spiritual power of unity in faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
