In ancient Near Eastern culture, city gates and doors were central to community life, representing access and interaction. As people age, their ability to participate in public life diminishes, akin to doors being closed. This imagery can also reflect the spiritual state of being closed off from worldly distractions, focusing instead on eternal matters.<p><b>and the sound of the mill fades away</b><br>The mill was a common feature in ancient households, essential for grinding grain into flour. The fading sound of the mill signifies the cessation of daily labor and productivity, paralleling the reduced physical capabilities in old age. This imagery can also be seen as a metaphor for the diminishing vigor and energy of life. Biblically, it echoes the idea of life's temporality, as seen in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which describes life as a mist that appears briefly and then vanishes.<p><b>when one rises at the sound of a bird</b><br>This phrase captures the light sleep and restlessness often associated with aging. In biblical times, the early morning was marked by the chirping of birds, a natural alarm clock. The sensitivity to such sounds reflects the frailty and heightened awareness that comes with age. Spiritually, it can suggest a readiness to respond to God's call, reminiscent of the watchfulness encouraged in <a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>, where believers are urged to stay awake and be prepared for the Lord's coming.<p><b>and all the daughters of song grow faint</b><br>"Daughters of song" likely refers to the voice and hearing, both of which tend to weaken with age. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, music and singing were integral to worship and celebration, as seen in the Psalms. The fading of these "daughters" symbolizes the loss of joy and vibrancy in life. This decline can also be viewed as a call to focus on the eternal song of worship in heaven, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9-10</a>, where the redeemed sing a new song before the Lamb.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preacher.htm">The Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>Traditionally identified as Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel, who is considered the author of Ecclesiastes.

If a more minute explanation of the double doors is to be given, we may understand the verse as speaking of the closing of the lips on the falling away of the teeth. (See <a href="/job/41-14.htm" title="Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.">Job 41:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/141-3.htm" title="Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.">Psalm 141:3</a>; <a href="/micah/5-7.htm" title="And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the middle of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers on the grass, that tarries not for man, nor waits for the sons of men.">Micah 5:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He shall rise up.</span>--No satisfactory explanation of this clause has been given. The following are three of the best interpretations that have been proposed: (1) The old man, whose state has been figuratively described before, is said to sleep so badly that the chirping of a bird will awake him. (2) His voice becomes feeble like the chirping of a bird (<a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm" title="And you shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust, and your voice shall be, as of one that has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.">Isaiah 29:4</a>). (3) The bird of ill omen raises its voice (<a href="/context/psalms/102-6.htm" title="I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.">Psalm 102:6-7</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/2-14.htm" title="And flocks shall lie down in the middle of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he shall uncover the cedar work.">Zephaniah 2:14</a>). Each of these interpretations is open to serious objections, which I do not state at length, having myself nothing better to propose. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The doors shall be shut in the streets</span>. Hitherto the symbolism has been comparatively easy to interpret. With this verse inextricable difficulties seem to arise. Of course, in one view it is natural that in the bitter weather, or on the appearance of a tempest, the doors towards the street should be closed, and none should leave the house. But what are meant by the doors in the metaphorical house, the body of the aged man? Jewish expositors understood them to be the pores, or excretive apertures of the body, which lose their activity in old age - which seems an unseemly allusion. Plumptre will have them to be the organs which carry on the processes of sensation and nutrition from the beginning to the end; but it seems a forced metaphor to call these "double-doors." More natural is it to see in the word, with its dual form, the mouth closed by the two lips. So a psalmist speaks of the mouth, the door of the lips (<a href="/psalms/141-3.htm">Psalm 141:3</a>; comp. <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>). As it is only the external door of a house that could be employed in this metaphor, the addition, "in [or, 'towards'] the streets," is accounted for. <span class="cmt_word">When the sound of the grinding is low</span>. The sound of the grinding or the mill is weak and low when the teeth have ceased to masticate, and, instead of the crunching and grinding of food, nothing is heard but a munching and sucking. The falling in of the mouth over the toothless gums is represented as the closing of doors. To take the words in their literal sense is to make the author repeat himself, reiterating what he is supposed to have said before in speaking of the grinding-women - all labor is lessened or stopped. The sound of grinding betokened cheerfulness and prosperity; its cessation would be an ominous sign (see <a href="/jeremiah/25-10.htm">Jeremiah 25:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-22.htm">Revelation 18:22</a>). Another interpretation considers this clause to express the imperfect vocal utterance of the old man; but it is hardly likely that the author would call speech "the voice of the grinding," or of the mill, as a metaphor for "mouth." <span class="cmt_word">And he shall rise up at the voice of the bird</span>. This is a very difficult sentence, and has been very variously explained. It is usually taken to mean that the old man sleeps lightly and awakes (for "rises up" may mean no more than that) at the chirrup of a bird. The objection to this interpretation is that it destroys the figurative character of the description, introducing suddenly the personal subject. Of course, it has another signification in the picture of the terror-stricken household; and many interpreters who thus explain the allegory translate the clause differently. Thus Ginsburg renders, "The swallow rises to shriek," referring to the habits of that bird in stormy weather. But there are grammatical objections to this translation, as there are against another suggestion, "The bird (of ill omen) raises its voice." We need not do more than refer to the mystical elucidation which detects here a reference to the resurrection, the voice of the bird being the archangel's trumpet which calls the dead from their graves. Retaining the allegory, we must translate the clause, "He [or, 'it,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the voice] rises to the bird's voice;" the old man's voice becomes a "childish treble," like the piping of a little bird. The relaxation of the muscles of the larynx and other vocal organs occasions a great difference in the pitch or power of tone (compare what Hezekiah says, <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>, "Like a crane or a swallow so did I chatter," though there it is the low murmur of sorrow and complaint that is meant). <span class="cmt_word">And all the daughters of music shall be brought low.</span> "The daughters of song" are the organs of speech, which ere now humbled and fail, so that the man cannot sing a note. Some think that the ears are meant, as St. Jerome writes, Et <span class="accented">obsurdescent omnes filiae carminis</span>, which may have some such notion. Others arrive at a similar signification from manipulation of the verb, thus eliciting the sense - The sounds of singing-women or song-birds are dulled and lowered, are only heard as a faint, unmeaning murmur. This exposition rather contradicts what had preceded, viz. that the old man is awoke by the chirrup of a sparrow; for his ears must be very sensitive to be thus easily affected; unless, indeed, the "voice of the bird" is merely a note of time, equivalent to early cock-crowing. We must not omit Wright's explanation, though it does not commend itself to our mind. He makes a new stanza begin here: "When one rises at the voice of the bird," and sees here a description of the approach of spring, as if the poet said, "When the young and lusty are enjoying the return of genial weather, and the concert of birds with which no musician can compete, the aged, sick in their chambers, are beset with fears and are sinking fast." We fail altogether to read this meaning in our text, wherein we recognize only a symbolical representation of the old man's vocal powers. It is obvious to cite Juvenal's minute and painful description of old age in 'Sat.,' 10:200, etc., and Shakespeare's lines in 'As You Like It' (act 2. sc. 7), where the reference to the voice is very striking- <p><span class="accented">"His big, manly voice,<br />Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br />And whistles in his sound."</span> Cox paraphrases, "The song-birds drop silently into their nests," alarmed at the tempest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/12-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">when the doors</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7791;a&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fd<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1817.htm">Strong's 1817: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something swinging, the valve of a, door</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the street</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#353;&#183;&#353;&#363;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
