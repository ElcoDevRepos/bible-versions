The terms "wisdom," "madness," and "folly" represent different approaches to life. Wisdom, often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), is contrasted with madness and folly, which denote irrational and foolish behavior. This triad suggests a comprehensive examination of human experience. Solomon's exploration is reminiscent of his request for wisdom from God (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>), highlighting the biblical theme of seeking divine insight over human understanding.<p><b>for what more can the king&#8217;s successor do</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the limitations of human achievement and legacy. The "king's successor" refers to those who come after Solomon, suggesting that future rulers will face the same existential questions. Historically, Solomon's reign was marked by unprecedented wealth and wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/10-23.htm">1 Kings 10:23-24</a>), setting a high standard for successors. This reflects the biblical theme of the fleeting nature of human accomplishments, as seen in <a href="/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>, where the wise and foolish alike leave their wealth to others.<p><b>than what has already been accomplished?</b><br>Here, the text emphasizes the futility of striving for new achievements when so much has already been done. This echoes the theme of vanity found throughout Ecclesiastes, where human efforts are often seen as repetitive and ultimately unsatisfying (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a>). The phrase suggests a cyclical view of history, where each generation repeats the actions of the previous one. This can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of human striving apart from God, as seen in the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>), where human efforts to reach the heavens without divine guidance result in confusion and dispersion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects.

The Authorised Version gives the following very good sense: If the king has failed in his experiment, what likelihood is there that a private person should be more successful? Yet bearing in mind that in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm" title="Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labor that he takes under the sun all the days of his life, which God gives him: for it is his portion.">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a> the "man that cometh after the king" means his successor, and also that the theme of the whole section is that in human affairs there is no progress, it is more simple to understand this verse: the king's successor can do no more than run the same round that has been trodden by his predecessor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-26.</span> - Section 3. <span class="accented">Vanity of wisdom</span>, <span class="accented">in view of the fate that awaits the wise man equally with the fool</span>, <span class="accented">and the uncertainty of the future of his labors</span>, <span class="accented">especially as man is not master of his own fate</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly</span> (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>). He studied the three in their mutual connection and relation, comparing them in their results and effects on man's nature and life, and deducing thence their real value. On one side he set wisdom, on the other the action, and habits which he rightly terms "madness and folly," and examined them calmly and critically. <span class="cmt_word">For what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done</span>. Both the Authorized Version and Revised Version render the passage thus, though the latter, in the margin, gives two alternative renderings of the second clause, viz. <span class="accented">even him whom they made king long ago</span>, and, as in the Authorized Version margin, in <span class="accented">those things which have been already done</span>. The LXX., following a different reading, gives, "For what man is there who will follow after counsel in whatsoever things he employed it?" Vulgate, "What is man, said I, that he should be able to follow the King, his Maker?" Wright, Delitzsch, Nowack, etc., "For what is the man that is to come after the king whom they made so long ago?" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. who can have greater experience than Solomon made king in old time amid universal acclamation (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-22.htm">1 Chronicles 29:22</a>)? or, who can hope to equal his fame? - which does not seem quite suitable, as it is the abnormal opportunities of investigation given by his unique position which would be the point of the query. The Authorized Version gives a fairly satisfactory (and grammatically unobjectionable) meaning - What can any one effect who tries the same experiment as the king did? He could not do so under more favorable conditions, and will only repeat the same process and reach the same result. But the passage is obscure, and every interpretation has its own difficulty. If the <span class="accented">ki</span> with which the second portion of the passage begins ("for what," etc.) assigns the reason or motive of the first portion, shows what was the design of Koheleth in contrasting wisdom and folly, the rendering of the Authorized Version is not inappropriate. Many critics consider that Solomon is here speaking of his successor, asking what kind of man he will be who comes after him - the man whom some have already chosen? And certainly there is some ground for this interpretation in vers. 18, 19, where the complaint is that all the king's greatness and glory will be left to an unworthy successor. But this view requires the Solomonic authorship of the book, and makes him to refer to Rehoboam or some illegitimate usurper. The wording of the text is too general to admit of this explanation; nor does it exactly suit the immediate context, or duly connect the two clauses of the verse. It seems best to take the successor, not as one who comes to the kingdom, but as one who pursues similar investigations, repeats Koheleth's experiments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">turned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;n&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
