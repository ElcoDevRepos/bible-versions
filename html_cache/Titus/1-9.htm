The "faithful word" refers to the gospel message and the doctrines that were passed down from the apostles. In the early church, oral tradition was a primary means of transmitting teachings, and maintaining the integrity of these teachings was crucial. This aligns with Paul's exhortation in <a href="/2_timothy/1-13.htm">2 Timothy 1:13-14</a> to "hold fast the pattern of sound words." The phrase underscores the necessity for church leaders to be grounded in scripture, ensuring that their teachings remain true to the apostolic doctrine.<p><b>so that he can encourage others by sound teaching</b><br>The role of a church leader includes the responsibility to build up the faith of the congregation through "sound teaching." This involves not only imparting knowledge but also nurturing spiritual growth and maturity. The term "sound" implies health and wholeness, suggesting that the teachings should be free from error and conducive to spiritual well-being. This is consistent with Paul's instructions in <a href="/1_timothy/4-6.htm">1 Timothy 4:6</a>, where he advises Timothy to be "nourished in the words of faith and of good doctrine." The encouragement provided by sound teaching helps believers to remain steadfast in their faith amidst challenges.<p><b>and refute those who contradict it</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the defensive aspect of a leader's role, which involves protecting the church from false teachings and heresies. In the context of the early church, there were numerous false teachers and doctrines that threatened the purity of the gospel. The ability to refute such contradictions requires a deep understanding of scripture and the ability to discern truth from error. This is echoed in <a href="/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>, where believers are urged to "contend earnestly for the faith." The leader's task is to safeguard the congregation by addressing and correcting false teachings, ensuring that the truth of the gospel remains untainted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A Greek convert and a close companion of the Apostle Paul, Titus was left in Crete to organize the church and appoint elders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The Apostle who wrote the letter to Titus, providing guidance on church leadership and sound doctrine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crete.htm">Crete</a></b><br>An island in the Mediterranean where Titus was tasked with establishing church order and combating false teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders.htm">Elders</a></b><br>Church leaders who are expected to uphold sound doctrine and provide spiritual guidance to the congregation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals who spread incorrect teachings, against whom the elders must be prepared to defend the truth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_sound_doctrine.htm">The Importance of Sound Doctrine</a></b><br>Elders must be grounded in the truth of the Gospel to effectively lead and protect the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_and_refutation.htm">Encouragement and Refutation</a></b><br>Church leaders are called to both encourage believers in their faith and refute false teachings with confidence and clarity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holding_firmly_to_the_truth.htm">Holding Firmly to the Truth</a></b><br>The Greek word for "hold firmly" (antechomai) implies a strong, unwavering grip on the truth, highlighting the necessity of steadfastness in faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_teaching.htm">The Role of Teaching</a></b><br>Sound teaching is essential for the spiritual health of the church, providing a foundation for growth and protection against deception.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_falsehood.htm">Guarding Against Falsehood</a></b><br>Elders must be vigilant in identifying and addressing false teachings to maintain the purity of the Gospel message.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Titus_1_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Titus 1:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_uphold_the_message_today.htm">How can we "hold firmly to the trustworthy message" in today's society?

The elder must, St. Paul says, hold fast the faithful word or saying; or, in other words, must steadily adhere to that Christian doctrine taught by St. Paul and his brother Apostles. So St. Paul pressed on Timothy, the chief presbyter of Ephesus, "to hold the pattern of sound words which thou heardest from me" (<a href="/2_timothy/1-13.htm" title="Hold fast the form of sound words, which you have heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.">2Timothy 1:13</a>); and again, "But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned, and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them" (<a href="/2_timothy/3-14.htm" title="But continue you in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing of whom you have learned them;">2Timothy 3:14</a>). Here "the faithful saying," that formulary so common in the Epistles to Timothy and to Titus, and which we have generally explained as including the great Christian watchwords of the faith, echoes probably of sayings of Christ, taken up and expanded by His chosen servants, and then adopted in the various churches and woven into the tapestry of the earliest liturgies--now, possibly, after a form like the "comfortable words" of our Communion Service, now into a creed, now into a hymn, but in one shape or other thoroughly well known and loved in the different congregations--here the faithful word or saying seems to include <span class= "ital">all</span> the faithful sayings, and denotes generally the teaching of St. Paul and the Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">To exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</span>--Two special purposes are specified for which the "sound doctrine" which the elder will acquire by steadfast application may be used. The first, with the sound, healthy teaching--sound, healthy, practical, compared with that sickly, morbid, and unpractical teaching of those gainsayers of whom he is going to speak--he is <span class= "ital">to exhort</span> the adversaries; secondly, with the same true words he is <span class= "ital">to confute</span> their arguments.
