In biblical context, purity often refers to moral and spiritual cleanliness. Jesus taught that purity comes from within (<a href="/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>), and Paul echoes this by suggesting that those who are pure in heart see the world through a lens of purity. This aligns with the Jewish understanding of purity laws, which were not just about external cleanliness but also about internal holiness (Leviticus 11). The pure-hearted are those who have been cleansed by faith in Christ, and thus, they perceive and interact with the world in a way that reflects their inner transformation.<p><b>but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure.</b><br>Here, Paul contrasts the pure with those who are defiled and unbelieving. In the cultural context of Crete, where Titus was ministering, there were many who were influenced by false teachings and pagan practices. The defiled are those who have not accepted the cleansing power of Christ's sacrifice. Their unbelief taints their perception, making it impossible for them to see purity in anything. This reflects the biblical principle that without faith, it is impossible to please God (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>), and without a renewed mind, one cannot discern spiritual truths (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p><b>Indeed, both their minds and their consciences are defiled.</b><br>This statement underscores the comprehensive nature of defilement in those who reject the truth. The mind, in biblical terms, is often associated with understanding and reasoning (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>), while the conscience is the inner sense of right and wrong (<a href="/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>). When both are defiled, it indicates a deep-seated corruption that affects one's ability to discern and choose rightly. This defilement is a result of sin and unbelief, which blinds individuals to the truth of the Gospel (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). The defiled conscience is seared and unable to respond to God's moral law, leading to a life that is out of alignment with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A trusted companion of the Apostle Paul, Titus was a Greek believer who played a significant role in the early church.

The pure, redeemed by grace, can approach God&#8217;s gifts with confident gratitude, using them in ways that honor Him. The defiled and unbelieving, however, view everything through a lens darkened by sin; their thoughts and moral judgments are twisted, leaving them incapable of true purity. The verse reminds believers of the transforming power of salvation and the need to guard both heart and conscience as they live in the freedom Christ provides.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/titus/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Unto the pure all things are pure.</span>--The spirit of this famous saying of St. Paul, occurring almost in the same language in the Roman Letter (<a href="/romans/14-20.htm" title="For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eats with offense.">Romans 14:20</a>), was the groundwork of much of the Gentile Apostle's teaching. The words of the Lord Jesus above referred to (<a href="/matthew/15-2.htm" title="Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.">Matthew 15:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-11.htm" title="Not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.">Matthew 15:11</a>) contain the same grand truth. "All things" include much besides mere food--in a word, include all acts connected with every-day life which in themselves are neither right nor wrong, neither good nor evil, but which derive their colouring of good or evil solely from the doer of the act. Bengel well sums this up in his "omnia externa eis, qui intus sunt mundi, munda sunt."<p><span class= "bld">But unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure.</span>--Here, as so often in these Pastoral Epistles, the last utterance, so to speak, of that grand life of St. Paul's, purity and sound doctrine are inseparable. Here "the defiled," "the polluted," we are told, are the unbelieving; and to these, the Apostle says, nothing is pure. Yet there is nothing in God's creation impure or evil--the evil and impurity are in the mind and heart of men; these may, and often do, defile and make impure the choicest gifts of God's creation. One word is still left to be said on the teaching of this memorable verse. <span class= "ital">Who</span> are the pure to whom all things are pure? Only those in this world who have sought cleansing by faith in the precious blood of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">But even their mind and conscience is defiled.</span>--Here St. Paul defines exactly the sphere over which the moral defilement of these hapless ones, who belong to the Christian company, alas, only in name, extends--the mind and conscience. The first of these--<span class= "ital">the mind</span>--is the willing as well as the thinking part of man, as it has been well defined the human spirit (<span class= "ital">pneuma</span>) in one of its aspects, not simply <span class= "ital">quatenus cogitat et intelligit, </span>but also <span class= "ital">quatenus vult.</span> Defilement of this mind (<span class= "ital">nous</span>) means that the thoughts, wishes, purposes, activities, are all stained and debased. The second of these--the conscience (<span class= "ital">suneid?sis</span>)--is the moral consciousness within, that which is ever bringing up the memory of the past, with its omissions and commissions, its errors, its cruel, heartless unkindness, its selfish disregard of others. When <span class= "ital">this</span> is defiled, then this last safeguard of the soul is broken down. The man and woman of the defiled conscience is <span class= "ital">self-satisfied, </span>hard, impenitent to the last.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="accented">- To</span> for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V.

We learn also from <a href="/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>; and elsewhere, what were the kind of questions which agitated the Judaizing Christians. But St. Paul in a few wise words shows the utter worthlessness of such controversies. "To the pure all things are pure." "There is nothing from without a man," said our Lord, "that entering into him can defile him" (<a href="/mark/7-15.htm">Mark 7:15</a>); "Neither if we cat are we the better, neither if we eat not are we the worse" (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>); "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost" (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>). But unto those that are defiled by what comes from within them, and have no faith (<a href="/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a>), nothing is pure. Their mind and conscience, being defiled, defile everything they do.
