The concept of giving oneself is rooted in the Old Testament sacrificial system, where offerings were made to atone for sin (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). Jesus' self-giving is the ultimate fulfillment of these sacrifices, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which prophesies the suffering servant who would bear the iniquities of many. The voluntary nature of His sacrifice is highlighted in <a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>, where Jesus states that He lays down His life of His own accord.<p><b>to redeem us from all lawlessness</b><br>Redemption in biblical terms refers to the act of buying back or liberating from bondage. In the context of the New Testament, it signifies liberation from the power and penalty of sin. Lawlessness, or anomia in Greek, denotes living in a state of rebellion against God's law. This redemption is a fulfillment of the promise seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God promises to write His law on the hearts of His people, indicating a transformation from within.<p><b>and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession</b><br>The idea of purification is deeply rooted in the Jewish purification rites, which were necessary for worship and fellowship with God (<a href="/leviticus/16-30.htm">Leviticus 16:30</a>). This purification is not merely external but internal, as seen in <a href="/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>, where David asks God to create a clean heart within him. The phrase "a people for His own possession" echoes <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>, where God calls Israel His treasured possession. This indicates a special relationship and covenant, now extended to all believers through Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>.<p><b>zealous for good deeds</b><br>Zeal for good deeds reflects a transformed life that results from genuine faith. This is consistent with <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, which states that faith without works is dead. The early church was known for its acts of charity and service, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where believers shared everything in common and cared for those in need. This zeal is not self-generated but is a result of the Holy Spirit's work within believers, as described in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, where the fruit of the Spirit includes goodness and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, who gave Himself for humanity's redemption.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A young pastor and the recipient of this letter, tasked with teaching sound doctrine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the letter, providing guidance and instruction to Titus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cretan_church.htm">Cretan Church</a></b><br>The community of believers in Crete, where Titus was ministering.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/redemption.htm">Redemption</a></b><br>The act of Jesus giving Himself to free believers from lawlessness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/redemption_through_sacrifice.htm">Redemption through Sacrifice</a></b><br>Jesus' self-giving is the ultimate act of love and redemption, freeing us from the bondage of sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purification_for_purpose.htm">Purification for Purpose</a></b><br>Believers are not only redeemed but also purified to be set apart for God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/z/zealous_for_good_deeds.htm">Zealous for Good Deeds</a></b><br>Our response to redemption should be a life characterized by eagerness to do good works.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_as_god's_possession.htm">Identity as God's Possession</a></b><br>Understanding our identity as God's treasured possession should influence our daily living and priorities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_out_our_faith.htm">Living Out Our Faith</a></b><br>The call to be zealous for good deeds is a practical outworking of our faith, demonstrating the transformation Christ brings.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Titus_2_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Titus 2:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Titus_2_14_Jesus_purpose_in_redemption.htm">How does Titus 2:14 define Jesus' purpose in redeeming us from lawlessness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_His_own_possession.htm">What does it mean to be "a people for His own possession"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Be_zealous_for_good_deeds_daily.htm">How can we be "zealous for good deeds" in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Titus_2_14_Eph_2_10_on_good_works.htm">Connect Titus 2:14 with Ephesians 2:10 on good works and purpose.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Christ_s_redemption_on_holiness.htm">How does Christ's redemption influence our pursuit of holiness and good works?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Purpose_of_Jesus_sacrifice_in_Titus_2_14.htm">How does Titus 2:14 define the purpose of Jesus' sacrifice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_redeem_us_from_lawlessness.htm">What does "redeem us from all lawlessness" mean in Titus 2:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Titus_2_14_His_own_possession_link.htm">How does Titus 2:14 relate to the concept of being a "people for His own possession"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_titus_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Titus 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_good_works,_salvation.htm">What does the Bible say about good works and salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'peculiar_people'_mean.htm">What does "Peculiar People" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_he_present_with_the_lord_now.htm">What does it mean that Jesus is our Redeemer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'created_for_good'_mean.htm">What does "created for good works" mean?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Titus 2:14 Mean</div><b>He gave Himself for us</b><p>&#8220;Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God&#8221;

These words take up the thought expressed in the term "Saviour" of the last verse. "Himself," His whole self, as has been well said, "the greatest gift ever given;" "for us," that is, on our behalf.<p><span class= "bld">That he might redeem us from all iniquity.</span>--That He for us might pay a ransom, the ransom being His precious blood. Our Saviour, by the payment of this tremendous ransom--O deepest and most unfathomable of all mysteries!--released us from everything which is opposed to God's blessed will. Here the mighty ransom is spoken of as freeing us from the bondage of lawlessness; elsewhere in the divine books the same ransom is described as delivering us from the penalties of this same breaking the divine law--"alles was der Ordnung Gottes widerstreitet" (Hofmann, <span class= "ital">Commentary on Titus</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">And purify unto himself a peculiar people.</span>--The expression "a peculiar people" is taken from the LXX. translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, where the words occur several times (see <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-2.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are on the earth.">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>); the idea is also purely an Old Testament one. Just as Jehovah wished to establish a people which should belong to Him ("peculiarly His," "His very own"), submitting to His laws, in contrast to the rest of mankind, lawless, idolatrous--so Jesus would set apart and purify for Himself a people, which for His sake should devote itself to God, in contrast to the rest of humanity sunk in selfish sins. As Israel of old lived under the constant impression that they would again behold the visible glory of the Eternal, so His people now should live as men waiting for a second manifestation of <span class= "ital">His</span> glory.<p><span class= "bld">Zealous of good works.</span>--The man who hopes to see the epiphany of Jesus his Lord and Love in glory will struggle zealously with hand and brain to live his life in such a manner that he may meet his Lord, when He comes in glory, with joy. It was a people composed of such "zealots" of goodness, of men longing for His sake to do their utmost for His cause, that our great God and Saviour wished to purify unto Himself. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="accented">A people for his own possession</span> for <span class="accented">a peculiar people</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Who gave himself for us.</span> The resemblance in thought and diction to <a href="/1_timothy/2-3.htm">1 Timothy 2:3-6</a> has been already pointed out.

Both phrases, however, are used of our redemption by Jesus Christ.

The literal meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> is "in defense of," and hence generally "on behalf of," "for the good of." The primary idea of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is "standing opposite," and hence it denotes "exchange," "price," "worth," "instead," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Redeem</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); as <a href="/luke/24-21.htm">Luke 24:21</a>:<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>; common in classical Greek. In the middle voice, as here, it means "to release by payment of a ransom;" in the active voice, "to release on receipt of a ransom." In <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a> the ransom price is stated, viz. "the precious blood of Christ;" as in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a> it is "the life of the Son of man." The effect of this redemption is not merely deliverance from the penalty of sin, but from its power also, as appears by the following words: "a peculiar people, zealous of good works," and by the passage in St. Peter above referred to. <span class="cmt_word">Purify</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>); as very frequently in the New Testament of cleansing lepers, the outside of the platter, etc., cleansing the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>), putting away all sin (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>), cleansing the Church (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>), purging the conscience (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>), etc. The <span class="accented">iniquity</span> just spoken of was a defilement; the <span class="accented">redemption from iniquity</span> removed that defilement. The blood of Jesus Christ, the price paid for the redemption, was the instrument of cleansing (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7, 9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A people for his own possession</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but frequent in the LXX., coupled, as here, with <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-18.htm">Deuteronomy 26:18</a>), to express the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, a people the <span class="accented">peculiar</span> property, or treasure, of God; "peculiar" being derived from the Latin <span class="accented">peculium</span>, one's own private property, reserved for one's own private use. The Authorized Version "peculiar" expresses the sense exactly, and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of our text and of the LXX., from whom it is borrowed, is meant to define either that special reserved portion of a man's property over and above what he spends for ordinary expenses, which nobody can interfere with, or those jewels on which he sets a special value, and places safely in his treasury. In <a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> ("a peculiar people," Authorized Version) means the same thing, that being the LXX. translation of the same Hebrew word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, in <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm">Malachi 3:17</a> ("jewels," Authorized Version), "They shall be my reserved portion or possession." The application of the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, descriptive in the Old Testament of Israel, to the Church of Christ, is very instructive. The passage in <a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a> is exactly analogous, as is the phrase, "the Israel of God" (<a href="/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Zealous</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>); as <a href="/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20</a>; <a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-12.htm">1 Corinthians 14:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-14.htm">Galatians 1:14</a>. From its special application to those who were zealous for the Law of Moses it became the name of the sect or party of the <span class="accented">Zealots</span> who played such a terrible part in the Jewish war (see <a href="/luke/4-15.htm">Luke 4:15</a>). <span class="accented">Canaanite</span> (<a href="/matthew/10-4.htm">Matthew 10:4</a>; <a href="/mark/3-18.htm">Mark 3:18</a>) is the Hebrew for <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>. Zeal for good works is the indispensable mark of God's peculiar people, the inseparable fruit of the redemption and purification which is by the blood of Jesus Christ (comp. <a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/titus/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8003;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">gave</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#948;&#969;&#954;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ed&#333;ken)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1325.htm">Strong's 1325: </a> </span><span class="str2">To offer, give; I put, place.
