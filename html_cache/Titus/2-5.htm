In the Greco-Roman world, self-control was a highly valued virtue, often associated with wisdom and maturity. Biblically, self-control is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>) and is essential for living a life that honors God. It involves mastery over one's desires and impulses, aligning with the call to live soberly and righteously in the present age (<a href="/titus/2-12.htm">Titus 2:12</a>).<p><b>pure</b><br>Purity here refers to moral and sexual integrity. In the early church, maintaining purity was crucial for believers to stand apart from the surrounding pagan culture, which often engaged in licentious practices. Purity is linked to holiness and is a reflection of God's nature (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). It also connects to the idea of being a "pure bride" for Christ, as the church is often depicted (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>).<p><b>managers of their households</b><br>This phrase highlights the role of women in managing and overseeing the affairs of the home. In the first-century context, the household was the primary sphere of influence for women. <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-31</a> provides a detailed description of a virtuous woman who excels in managing her household. This role is not merely domestic but involves stewardship, leadership, and nurturing the family in faith.<p><b>kind</b><br>Kindness is a fundamental Christian virtue, reflecting the character of God (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>). In the cultural context of the early church, kindness would have been a countercultural trait, especially in a society that often valued power and dominance. Kindness involves compassion, generosity, and a willingness to serve others, embodying the love of Christ (<a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>).<p><b>and submissive to their own husbands</b><br>This phrase is often discussed in the context of biblical teachings on marriage. Submission here is understood as a voluntary, respectful yielding to the leadership of one's husband, as part of the marital relationship. It reflects the order established in creation (<a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>) and is modeled after the relationship between Christ and the church. This submission is not about inferiority but about fulfilling God-given roles within the marriage.<p><b>so that the word of God will not be discredited</b><br>The conduct of believers, particularly in family and social relationships, has a direct impact on the reputation of the gospel. The early church faced scrutiny and opposition, and the behavior of Christians was a powerful testimony to the truth of God's word. By living according to these principles, believers ensure that their lives do not bring reproach upon the gospel, but rather, adorn it (<a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A young pastor and a trusted companion of the Apostle Paul, tasked with organizing the church in Crete and ensuring sound doctrine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The Apostle who wrote the letter to Titus, providing guidance on church leadership and Christian living.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cretan_church.htm">Cretan Church</a></b><br>The early Christian community on the island of Crete, known for its challenges with false teachings and cultural issues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/older_women.htm">Older Women</a></b><br>In the context of <a href="/bsb/titus/2.htm">Titus 2</a>, older women are instructed to teach and model godly behavior to younger women.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/y/younger_women.htm">Younger Women</a></b><br>The primary audience of <a href="/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5</a>, encouraged to live in a way that honors God and supports their families.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/self-control_and_purity.htm">Self-Control and Purity</a></b><br>The Greek word for "self-controlled" (sophronizo) implies a disciplined and sound mind.

Together they paint a portrait of faith that not only believes Scripture but makes its truth beautiful and undeniable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/titus/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">To be discreet.</span>--See Note in <a href="/titus/2-2.htm" title="That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.">Titus 2:2</a> of this chapter.<p><span class= "bld">Chaste.</span>--Not only in act, but also in look, in speech, in thought, even in dress.<p><span class= "bld">Keepers at home.--</span>The older authorities here, instead of "keepers at home" (<span class= "ital">domum custodientes, domus curam habentes</span>), read <span class= "ital">workers at home;</span> the Greek word is not found elsewhere. The sense of the passage is, however, little changed by the alteration. The meaning is clear, "Domi mansit lanam fecit." Home duties, cares, pleasures, sacrifices of self--these God-appointed duties ought to fill the mind and the heart of the young wife. There should be no desire, no attempt, to go round to the other houses, and so contracting idle, gossiping habits. Hofmann thus sums up these directions to the young Christian women of Crete, "Gute Hausfrauen will der Apostel haben."<p><span class= "bld">Good.</span>--Gracious, kind, thoughtful to others, especially to inferiors.<p><span class= "bld">Obedient to their own husbands.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">submitting themselves to their own husbands.</span> Women who really love their Master Christ should take care that, as far as in them lay, the law of subordination in the family to its rightful head should be strictly carried out. In a Church like that of Crete, made out of divided houses often, where the Christian wife was married to a Pagan husband, such a charge as this was especially needful.<p><span class= "bld">That the word of God be not blasphemed.</span>--These words refer to all the exhortations from <a href="/titus/2-2.htm" title="That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.">Titus 2:2</a> onwards, but more particularly to those clauses enforcing home duties immediately preceding. There was, of course, the fear that wives, carried away by religious fervour, might neglect the plainer every-day duties for the seemingly loftier and more self-denying occupations included under the head of religious works. Such failure in every-day tasks would, of course, be bitterly charged on the religion of Christ, and the gospel would run the danger of being evil-spoken of, even in other than purely Pagan circles. But the reference extends over a broader area than that occupied by Christian mistresses of households. All, of every rank and age, who think they love the Lord Jesus should remember that the "enemy" is ever watching their words and works; never should they who wear the colours of the great King forget the charge of the King's son, "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Sober-minded</span> for <span class="accented">discreet</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">workers</span> for <span class="accented">keepers</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">kind</span> for <span class="accented">good</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">being in subjection</span> for <span class="accented">obedient</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Sober</span>-<span class="cmt_word">minded</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); as in ver. 2 and <a href="/titus/1-8.htm">Titus 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>. "Discreet" is nearer the sense than "sober-minded." Perhaps the French <span class="accented">sage</span> is nearer still. <span class="cmt_word">Workers at home</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, for the T.R. <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>). Neither word occurs elsewhere in the New Testament or in the <span class="accented">LXX.</span>, nor does <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in classical Greek. But <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which is probably the true reading (Huther), is common in good classical Greek for "stayers at home." It is derived from <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a "keeper." Kind (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>). The idea of <span class="accented">kindness</span> or <span class="accented">good nature</span> seems to be the side of goodness here intended; as we say, "He was very good to me" (so <a href="/matthew/20-15.htm">Matthew 20:15</a> and <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>). Kindness is the leading idea in <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Obedient</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). These identical words occur in <a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a> (see too <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That the Word of God be not blasphemed</span> (see <a href="/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1</a>). St. Paul complains that the Name of God was blasphemed among the Gentiles on account of the evil deeds of the Jews (<a href="/romans/2-24.htm">Romans 2:24</a>; see <a href="/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20-23</a>). Our Lord, on the other hand, exhorts that Christians, by their good works, should lead men to glorify their Father which is in heaven. The passage before us shows how much the honor of Christianity is bound up with the faithful discharge by Christians of the simple domestic duties of life. In truth, the <span class="accented">family</span> is the chief <span class="accented">seat</span>, and often the main test, of Christian virtue, as it is the distinctive feature of humanity as ordained by God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/titus/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[to be] self-controlled,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#974;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#333;phronas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4998.htm">Strong's 4998: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of sozo and that of phren; safe in mind, i.e. Self-controlled.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">pure,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7937;&#947;&#957;&#940;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hagnas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_53.htm">Strong's 53: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the same as hagios; properly, clean, i.e. innocent, modest, perfect.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">managers of their households,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#973;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(oikourgous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3626.htm">Strong's 3626: </a> </span><span class="str2">A keeper-at-home, a housekeeper.
