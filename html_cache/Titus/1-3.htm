Throughout Scripture, God's timing is shown to be precise and purposeful, as seen in <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, where it states that God sent His Son "when the fullness of time had come." This reflects the idea that God operates on His divine schedule, not human expectations.<p><b>He has made His word evident</b><br>The revelation of God's word is a central theme in the Bible. This phrase suggests that God's truth is not hidden but revealed clearly to humanity. The Greek term for "evident" implies something that is manifested or brought to light. This aligns with <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, making God's truth visible and accessible.<p><b>in the proclamation</b><br>The term "proclamation" refers to the preaching of the Gospel. In the early church, proclamation was a primary method of spreading the Christian message, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14-41</a>, where Peter's sermon led to the conversion of thousands. This highlights the importance of verbal communication in the dissemination of faith.<p><b>entrusted to me</b><br>Paul often speaks of the Gospel as a trust or stewardship given to him, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-17.htm">1 Corinthians 9:17</a>. This indicates a responsibility to faithfully deliver the message he received. The concept of being entrusted with the Gospel underscores the seriousness and accountability of his apostolic mission.<p><b>by the command of God our Savior</b><br>This phrase underscores divine authority and initiative. The term "command" suggests a direct and authoritative instruction from God, similar to Paul's calling on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15-16</a>). Referring to God as "our Savior" highlights the salvific nature of His command, emphasizing that the ultimate purpose of the Gospel is salvation through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to Titus, emphasizing his role as a preacher of God's word.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A trusted companion of Paul, serving as a leader in the early church, particularly in Crete.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_our_savior.htm">God our Savior</a></b><br>Refers to God as the source of salvation and the one who commands the proclamation of His word.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/crete.htm">Crete</a></b><br>The island where Titus was stationed to organize the church and appoint elders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/preaching.htm">Preaching</a></b><br>The act of proclaiming God's word, which Paul was entrusted with by divine command.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_timing.htm">Divine Timing</a></b><br>God's word is manifested in His own time, reminding us to trust in His perfect timing for all things.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/entrusted_with_the_gospel.htm">Entrusted with the Gospel</a></b><br>Like Paul, believers are entrusted with the responsibility to share the gospel, emphasizing the importance of faithful stewardship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_god's_command.htm">Authority of God's Command</a></b><br>The preaching of the word is not a human invention but a divine command, underscoring the authority and urgency of evangelism.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_preaching.htm">Role of Preaching</a></b><br>Preaching is a primary means through which God reveals His word, highlighting the importance of sound teaching and doctrine in the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_savior.htm">God as Savior</a></b><br>Recognizing God as our Savior should inspire gratitude and a desire to share the message of salvation with others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Titus_1_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Titus 1:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Titus_1_3_God_s_timing_in_revelation.htm">How does Titus 1:3 emphasize God's timing in revealing His word?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_preaching_reveal_God_s_word.htm">What role does preaching play in manifesting God's word, according to Titus 1:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Titus_1_3_Matthew_28_19-20_link.htm">How does Titus 1:3 connect with the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Titus_1_3_s_preach_command.htm">How can you apply the command to preach in Titus 1:3 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Titus_1_3_inspire_Gospel_boldness.htm">In what ways does Titus 1:3 encourage boldness in sharing the Gospel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Titus_1_3_Divine_authority_in_preaching.htm">How does Titus 1:3 affirm the divine authority of apostolic preaching?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Titus_1_3_God_s_timing_for_His_word.htm">What does Titus 1:3 reveal about God's timing in revealing His word?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Titus_1_3_Proof_of_God_s_promises.htm">How does Titus 1:3 support the concept of God's promises being fulfilled?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_titus_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Titus 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_intimidation.htm">What is the definition of Apostolic Action?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_impact_of_timely_words.htm">How do teaching and senior pastors differ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/do_titus_3_5-6_and_james_2_17_conflict.htm">Does Titus 3:5-6, emphasizing salvation by mercy alone, conflict with James 2:17, which stresses the necessity of good works?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/early_lds_leaders'_teachings.htm">Was the Word God?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Titus 1:3 Mean</div><b>In His own time</b><p>God never hurries, and He never lags behind.

(See <a href="/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Through preaching.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">in the preaching.</span> Paul does not shrink from calling his preaching the vehicle in which the Word or the gospel of God was to be publicly manifested, because he was conscious that he was divinely instructed in the secrets of the eternal counsels.<p><span class= "bld">Which is committed unto me.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">with which I was entrusted.</span><p><span class= "bld">According to the commandment of God our Saviour.</span>--The commandment came to St. Paul direct from God; we have several intimations of this. Amongst others, on the Damascus road, when the Lord appeared to him; in the Temple at Jerusalem; in the ship, during the memorable voyage which ended with shipwreck; in the visions mentioned in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.">2Corinthians 12:1-9</a>. St. Paul dwells with emphasis on the thought that <span class= "ital">he was entrusted with</span> the preaching of the gospel according to the commandment of God. The work was not undertaken by him, from any will or wish of his own. "God our Saviour" in this place, as in <a href="/1_timothy/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;">1Timothy 1:1</a>, must be understood as "God the Father." The First Person of the blessed Trinity fitly possesses the title of "our Saviour," because through the death of His dear Son He redeemed us from death and made us heirs of eternal life. The Second Person of the Trinity is likewise a possessor of the title, because He shed His blood as the price of our redemption. The epithet of "Saviour"--the title just given to the Father, in the very next verse ascribed to the "Son"--is one of the many indications we possess of St. Paul's belief that the Son was equal to the Father as touching His Godhead.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">In</span> <span class="accented">his own seasons</span> for <span class="accented">hath due times</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in the message</span> for <span class="accented">through preaching</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">wherewith</span> 1 <span class="accented">was entrusted</span> for <span class="accented">which is committed unto me</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">In his own seasons.</span> The margin, <span class="accented">its own seasons</span>, is preferable (see <a href="/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>, note). The phrase is equivalent to "the fullness of the time" (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Manifested his Word.</span> There is a change of construction. "The relative sentence passes almost imperceptibly into a primary sentence" (Buttmann in Huther); "his Word" becomes the object of the verb "made manifest," instead of "eternal life," as one would have expected. <span class="cmt_word">His Word</span> is the whole revelation of the gospel, including the Person and work of Jesus Christ. Compare St. Peter's address to Cornelius (<a href="/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36</a>). This "Word," which lay in the mind of God through the ages, and was only dimly expressed in the promises given from time to time (<a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>), was now "<span class="accented">made</span> manifest," and proclaimed openly in that preaching of the gospel of God's grace which was entrusted to St. Paul.
