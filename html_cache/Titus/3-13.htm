The call to "do your best" reflects a sense of urgency and commitment, suggesting that the work of the gospel requires active participation and support from the Christian community. This aligns with the broader biblical principle of stewardship and generosity, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, which encourages cheerful giving.<p><b>Zenas the lawyer</b><br>Zenas is mentioned only here in the New Testament, and his designation as "the lawyer" suggests he was likely skilled in Jewish law or possibly Roman law. His inclusion highlights the diversity of backgrounds among early Christian workers and the value of different skills in the service of the gospel. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using people from various walks of life, as seen in the calling of Matthew, a tax collector, in <a href="/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9</a>.<p><b>and Apollos</b><br>Apollos is a more familiar figure in the New Testament, known for his eloquence and knowledge of the Scriptures (<a href="/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24-28</a>). He was a significant leader in the early church, particularly in Corinth, where he worked alongside Paul. His mention here underscores the collaborative nature of early Christian ministry and the importance of equipping leaders to effectively teach and spread the gospel. This collaboration is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>, where Paul speaks of planting and Apollos watering, but God giving the growth.<p><b>so that they will have everything they need</b><br>This phrase indicates the practical aspect of ministry support, ensuring that workers are not hindered by a lack of resources. It reflects the early church's commitment to mutual aid and support, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where believers shared their possessions to meet each other's needs. This principle of providing for those in ministry is also echoed in <a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>, which states that "the worker deserves his wages," emphasizing the responsibility of the Christian community to support those who labor in the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A trusted companion of Paul, Titus was a Gentile convert and a leader in the early church.

The term "lawyer" might possibly indicate that this friend of Paul's was a Roman jurist, but it is more likely that the law in which he was an expert was that of Moses. Hippolytus numbers him among the seventy disciples, and relates how in after years he was Bishop of Diospolis. He is never mentioned by name in the New Testament, except in this place.<p><span class= "bld">And Apollos.</span>--This famous teacher appears often in the New Testament records, in the Acts and several of the Epistles. A distinguished Alexandrian scholar and a disciple of John the Baptist, he was converted to Christianity by the agency of the devoted Priscilla and Aquila, the tent-makers. He became the friend and intimate associate of St. Paul, and might, had he chosen, have rivalled or even superseded St. Paul in his supreme authority over the churches planted along the Mediterranean sea-board. But Apollos seems resolutely to have declined any such rivalry, and to have lived ever as the loyal and devoted friend of the great Apostle; who, however, always seems to have treated the learned and eloquent Alexandrian as an equal power in the Church of Christ, classing Apollos with St. Peter and himself. Luther's well-known suggestion that Apollos was the unknown writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews--"auctor Epistolae ad Hebros . . . ut ego arbritror Apollo"--the authorship (though not the canonicity) of which has been a disputed point as far back as the days of Origen, in the first half of the third century--has been adopted, though, of course, with much reserve, by many. Attention has been called to the somewhat remarkable fact that the names of these three friends of St. Paul, who were classed among his most faithful adherents in this almost the last Epistle he wrote, were derived from three of the most famous heathen deities--Zenas from Zeus; Artemas from Artemis, the famous tutelary goddess of Ephesus; Apollos from the well-known sun-god.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- Set forward</span> for <span class="accented">bring</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Set forward</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); the technical expression both in the New Testament and the LXX., and also in classical Greek, for helping a person forward on their journey by supplying them with money food, letters of recommendation, escort, or whatever else they might require (see <a href="/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a>; <a href="/acts/20-38.htm">Acts 20:38</a>; <a href="/acts/21-5.htm">Acts 21:5</a>; <a href="/romans/15-24.htm">Romans 15:24</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-6.htm">1 Corinthians 16:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-16.htm">2 Corinthians 1:16</a>; <a href="/3_john/1-6.htm">3 John 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Zenas the lawyer</span>.
