The term "corrupt" suggests a moral decay or deviation from the truth, aligning with the biblical understanding of sin as a departure from God's will. In the context of the early church, false teachings and divisions were significant issues, as seen in other epistles like <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>, where Paul warns against different gospels. The use of "sinful" underscores the gravity of the actions, indicating a willful rebellion against God's commandments. This reflects the broader biblical theme of sin as a pervasive problem in humanity, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>.<p><b>he is self-condemned.</b><br>The phrase "self-condemned" implies that the individual's actions and beliefs inherently lead to their own judgment. This concept is consistent with the biblical principle that one's words and deeds reveal the state of their heart, as Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/12-37.htm">Matthew 12:37</a>, where He states that by one's words, they will be justified or condemned. The self-condemnation here suggests an awareness or acknowledgment of wrongdoing, yet a refusal to repent or change. This aligns with the broader scriptural theme of accountability, where individuals are responsible for their choices, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>, which calls for repentance to avoid iniquity. The phrase also highlights the importance of sound doctrine and unity within the church, as emphasized throughout the pastoral epistles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A trusted companion of the Apostle Paul, Titus was a Gentile convert and a leader in the early church.

The next words&#8212;&#8220;knowing that&#8230;&#8221;&#8212;assume spiritual discernment that rests on revealed truth, not guesswork. When repeated warnings fail, we know the problem is no longer ignorance but hardened resistance. Jesus set the pattern: &#8220;By their fruit you will recognize them&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-20.htm">Matthew 7:20</a>). Likewise, <a href="/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3-5</a> identifies teachers who &#8220;understand nothing&#8221; yet stir up strife; their ongoing behavior furnishes the knowledge Titus needs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Such a man</b><p>The phrase narrows the focus to the individual who persists in causing factions. Scripture consistently personalizes accountability: <a href="/acts/13-10.htm">Acts 13:10</a> calls Elymas &#8220;son of the devil&#8221; for opposing the gospel, and 3 <a href="/bsb/john/9.htm">John 9-10</a> names Diotrephes as one who loves preeminence. Titus must see beyond abstract error to the person who willingly spreads it. &#8220;Anyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God&#8221; (2 <a href="/bsb/john/9.htm">John 9</a>). The man described has crossed that line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is corrupt</b><p>Corruption here points to an internal decay already at work. Jesus spoke of &#8220;bad trees&#8221; producing &#8220;bad fruit&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-17.htm">Matthew 7:17-18</a>). Paul said deceivers are &#8220;corrupted in mind&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>) and &#8220;their unbelieving mind is defiled&#8221; (<a href="/titus/1-15.htm">Titus 1:15</a>). The divisive person isn&#8217;t merely making a mistake; his heart and motives have rotted, twisting truth to serve self.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And sinful</b><p>The corruption overflows in ongoing, willful sin. &#8220;Everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34</a>). Unlike a brother who stumbles yet repents (<a href="/luke/17-3.htm">Luke 17:3</a>), this man persists, showing that sin, not Christ, rules him. <a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26</a> warns that deliberate sin after receiving knowledge of the truth leaves no further sacrifice&#8212;only judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is self-condemned</b><p>No outside verdict is needed; his actions condemn him. &#8220;This is the judgment: The Light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than the Light&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>). By rejecting correction, he passes sentence on himself, much like the Jews who judged themselves &#8220;unworthy of eternal life&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>). <a href="/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a> says conscience bears witness; here, persistent divisiveness shouts guilt, sealing his own condemnation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/titus/3-11.htm">Titus 3:11</a> teaches that when a person repeatedly rejects loving correction and continues to stir up division, we can know three things: he is already inwardly corrupted, actively sinning, and his own obstinate behavior has pronounced judgment upon him. Recognizing this protects the church, honors the truth, and leaves the unrepentant man to the consequences he himself has chosen.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/titus/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">is perverted and sinneth, being self-condemned.</span> Inasmuch as thou knowest, seeing that thy reproofs and warnings have been of none effect, that he is "thoroughly perverted"--the expression is a very strong one, and signifies literally <span class= "ital">hath been turned inside out.</span> The same verb is used in the LXX. translation of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-20.htm" title="And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very fraudulent generation, children in whom is no faith.">Deuteronomy 32:20</a>, the <span class= "ital">"very froward</span> generation" of the English version--having been warned once and again, he is without the excuse of ignorance, but sins on in the full consciousness of his wilful and seditious life. His perverse conduct in stirring up party-feeling in the Church publicly convicts him of doing the very wrong which in general he professes to condemn. With these words the public or official portion of the Letter to the presiding presbyter in Crete closes. Paul had begun with directions how the church life of the island--up to this period apparently devoid of organisation--was to be arranged; he concludes with instructions how to deal with any who presumed to set themselves in opposition to his plans for the government of the community. The central portion of the letter is occupied in discussing how Christian doctrine is to influence the lives of those accepting it, and especially it treats of the conduct of Christians towards the Pagan world, with whom they will necessarily be brought in contact.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- Such a one</span> for <span class="accented">be that is such</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">perverted</span> for <span class="accented">subverted</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">self-condemned</span> for <span class="accented">condemned of himself</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Is perverted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but common in the LXX., and found in classical Greek in a material sense, "to turn inside out," "to root up," and the like. Here it means the complete pervert-ion of the man's Christian character, so as to leave no hope of his amendment. But this is not to be presumed till a first and second admonition have been given in vain. <span class="cmt_word">Self-condemned</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the New Testament, not found in the LXX. nor in classical Greek. It means what Cicero (quoted by Schleusner) says of C. Fabricius, that he was <span class="accented">suo judicio condemnatus</span>, condemned by his own judgment, which, he says, is a heavier condemnation than even that of the law and of the judges ('Pro Cluentio,' 21, at the end). Fabricius was self-condemned because he had left the court in confusion at a critical part of his trial. So the heretics were self-condemned by the very fact that they continued to head the schism after repeated admonitions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/titus/3-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">knowing</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eid&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">such a man</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(toioutos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5108.htm">Strong's 5108: </a> </span><span class="str2">(including the other inflections); from toi and houtos; truly this, i.e. Of this sort (to denote character or individuality).</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is corrupt</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#958;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(exestraptai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1612.htm">Strong's 1612: </a> </span><span class="str2">To change for the worse, corrupt, pervert.
