This act of crying out is a prophetic declaration, emphasizing the authority and urgency of the message. The phrase "by the word of the LORD" underscores that the prophet's message is not of his own making but is divinely inspired, reflecting the biblical theme of God using prophets to communicate His will. This aligns with other instances where prophets are sent to call out sin and idolatry, such as Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18).<p><b>&#8220;O altar, O altar, this is what the LORD says:</b><br>The repetition of "O altar" emphasizes the seriousness and certainty of the prophecy. In biblical literature, repetition often serves to highlight the importance of a message. The phrase "this is what the LORD says" is a common prophetic formula, indicating that the message is a direct revelation from God. This formula is used throughout the Old Testament to authenticate the divine origin of a prophecy, as seen in the messages of prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>&#8216;A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David,</b><br>This prophecy is remarkable for its specificity, naming Josiah, who would not be born for another 300 years. Josiah's birth and actions are recorded in <a href="/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22-23</a>, where he is noted for his reforms and efforts to restore true worship in Judah. The mention of the "house of David" connects this prophecy to the Davidic covenant, highlighting God's ongoing commitment to David's lineage despite the nation's unfaithfulness. This also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, a descendant of David.<p><b>and upon you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense upon you,</b><br>This part of the prophecy foretells the desecration of the altar by Josiah, who would execute the priests of the high places as part of his religious reforms. The "high places" were sites of unauthorized worship, often associated with idolatry, which were condemned by God. Josiah's actions are detailed in <a href="/2_kings/23-20.htm">2 Kings 23:20</a>, where he defiles these sites to purify the worship of Yahweh. This act of judgment against the priests signifies the seriousness of idolatry and the need for true worship.<p><b>and human bones will be burned upon you.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Burning human bones on the altar would defile it, rendering it unfit for worship and symbolizing the complete rejection of the idolatrous practices associated with it. This act of defilement is a powerful statement against the syncretism and apostasy that had taken hold in Israel. The fulfillment of this prophecy is recorded in <a href="/2_kings/23-16.htm">2 Kings 23:16</a>, where Josiah burns the bones of the priests on the altar at Bethel. This action serves as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and false worship, pointing to the need for purity and holiness in the worship of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>An unnamed prophet from Judah who delivers God's message to King Jeroboam and the altar at Bethel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_jeroboam.htm">King Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, who led the people into idolatry by setting up golden calves at Bethel and Dan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_at_bethel.htm">The Altar at Bethel</a></b><br>A significant site of idolatrous worship established by Jeroboam, which becomes the focus of God's judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>A future king of Judah, prophesied to bring reform and destroy the idolatrous practices initiated by Jeroboam.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_david.htm">The House of David</a></b><br>The royal lineage from which Josiah will come, emphasizing God's covenant faithfulness to David's line.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_fulfillment.htm">Prophetic Fulfillment</a></b><br>God's Word is reliable and will come to pass, as seen in the prophecy about Josiah.

It has been indeed suggested that the words. "Josiah by name" are a marginal gloss which has crept into the text, or the insertion of the chronicler writing after the event, and not a part of the original prophetic utterance. The latter supposition is in itself not unlikely. But the mention of the name in prediction is exemplified in the well-known reference to Cyrus in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm" title="That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.">Isaiah 44:28</a>; and in this instance, as perhaps also in that, the name is significant (for Josiah means "one healed" or "helped by Jehovah"), and is not, therefore, a mere artificial detail. The particularity of prediction, which is on all hands recognised as exceptional, will be credible or incredible to us, according to the view which we take of the nature of prophetic prediction. If we resolve it into the intuitive sagacity of an inspired mind forecasting the future, because it sees more clearly than ordinary minds the germs of that future in the present, the particularity must seem incredible. If, on the other hand, we believe it to be the supernatural gift of a power to enter, in some measure, into "the mind of God," in whose fore- knowledge all the future is already seen and ordained, then it will be to us simply unusual, but in no sense incredible, that from time to time foreknowledge of details, as well as generalities, should be granted. It is beyond controversy that the latter view is the one put forward in Holy Scripture, both in the Old Testament and in the New. Prophecy is, indeed, something higher and greater than supernatural prediction; but it claims to include such prediction, both as a test of mission from God, and as a necessary part of its revelation of the dispensations of God. On the fulfilment of this prediction, see <a href="/context/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2Kings 23:15-20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord</span> [This apostrophe of the altar is very striking and significant. It is as if the prophet disdained to notice the royal but self-constituted priest; as if it were useless to appeal to him; as if his person was of little consequence compared with the religious system he was inaugurating, the system of which the altar was the centre and embodiment]; <span class="cmt_word">Behold a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name</span> [This particular mention of the Reformer by name was formerly regarded, as by many it is still, as a remarkable instance of prophetic foresight. But the tendency of late, even amongst orthodox theologians, has been to doubt the authenticity of these two words, on the ground that it is unlike Scripture prophecy in general to descend to such details, which rather belong to soothsaying than prediction. Prophecy concerns itself not with names, times, and similar particulars, but with the "progressive development of the kingdom of God in its general features" (Keil). It is not for a moment denied that the prophet could just as easily, speaking "in the word of the Lord," have mentioned the name of Josiah, as the circumstance that a son of the house of David would utterly destroy the worship of calves. But it is alleged that the latter prediction is quite in accordance with Scripture usage, and the former altogether contrarient thereto. The case of Cyrus (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>), it is true, is an exception to the rule, unless <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (which means <span class="accented">the sun</span>) is, like Pharaoh and Hadad, a name of office, a title of the Persian kings. The instances of Isaac (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>) and Solomon (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>) are not parallels, as in both these cases the name was highly significant, and each was mentioned, not by way of prophecy, but as a direction to bestow that name on a child shortly about to be born. And it is certainly noticeable - though the argument <span class="accented">e</span> <span class="accented">silentio is</span> necessarily a precarious one - "that where this narrative is again referred to (<a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15-18</a>) there is no allusion to the fact that the man of God had prophesied of Josiah <span class="accented">by</span> <span class="accented">name"</span> (Rawlinson). On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that the two words <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;</span> were no part of the original prophecy, but a marginal note which in course of time found its way accidentally into the text. The idea of Keil, that "Josiah" is mentioned here not as a proper name, but as an appellation, "he whom Jehovah sustains," is hardly worthy of serious consideration. It may be allowed, however, that the <span class="accented">meaning</span> of the name affords some slender reason for its mention]; <span class="cmt_word">and upon thee shall he offer</span> [lit., <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the priests of the high places</span> [see on 1 Kings 12:32] <span class="cmt_word">that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">bones of man, i.e.</span>, human bones. Nothing could more completely foreshadow the future desecration of the altar. The presence in the congregation of a living man who had merely touched a dead body and had not been purified, defiled the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>), how much more the dead body itself, burnt on the very altar. The Samaritan who once strewed the temple with human ashes (Jos., Ant. 18:02.2) knew that he took the most effectual way to pollute it] <span class="cmt_word">shall be burnt</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">shall they burn</span>] <span class="cmt_word">upon thee.</span> [For the fulfilment, see <a href="/2_kings/23-20.htm">2 Kings 23:20</a>, "At the ground of this judgment, as of the whole theocratic law, lies the <span class="accented">jus</span> talionis" (Keil, 1846).] It is worthy of note how completely this brief protest proclaimed to Jeroboam the utter and shameful overthrow, both of his political and religious systems. A child of the rival house of David should stand where <span class="accented">he</span> then stood, his successors extinct or powerless to prevent him, and should cover this new cultus with disgrace and contempt. The man of God, he must have felt, has proclaimed in few words the fall of his dynasty, the triumph of his rival, and the failure of all his schemes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/13-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he cried out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
