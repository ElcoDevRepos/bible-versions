This act of idolatry led the people away from the worship of Yahweh, which was central to their covenant relationship with God. The sin here is not just the creation of idols but the institutionalization of idolatry as a state religion, which had long-lasting effects on the Northern Kingdom of Israel.<p><b>the people walked as far as Dan</b><br>Dan was the northernmost city of the Kingdom of Israel, and its selection as a site for one of the golden calves was strategic. It was accessible to the northern tribes, reducing their need to travel to Jerusalem in the Southern Kingdom for worship. This geographical choice highlights the political motivations behind Jeroboam's actions, as he sought to consolidate his rule by providing convenient worship locations. Dan had a history of idolatry, as seen in <a href="/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>, where the tribe of Dan set up a carved image.<p><b>to worship before one of the calves.</b><br>The worship of the golden calves was a direct affront to the worship of Yahweh, who had delivered Israel from Egypt. The calves were likely intended to represent a visible symbol of God's presence, similar to the golden calf made by Aaron in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>. This act of worship was a syncretism, blending the worship of Yahweh with pagan practices, which was condemned by the prophets (e.g., <a href="/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5-6</a>).

But there is no sign of such variation in the LXX. (which only adds, in some MSS., "and deserted the house of the Lord") or other versions. The reason of the mention of Dan only is probably that there the old sanctuary remained, and the priesthood was ready: hence, in this case, "the people went to worship" at once. The verses which follow describe the erection of a temple and the creation of a priesthood at Bethel, necessary before the inauguration of the new worship at what naturally became the more prominent and magnificent sanctuary. This temple is called a "house of high places," partly perhaps from its actual position, partly to connect it with the use of "the high places" condemned in the Law. Indeed, as we have no notice of any time spent in building it, it is possible that some old "high place" was restored for the purpose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this thing became a sin</span> [It <span class="accented">was</span> in itself sinful, for it both set at nought the express prohibition of the Decalogue (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>), and also disregarded the one sanctuary of God's choice (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>). And it led to other sins, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, the intrusion of a schismatic and irregular priesthood, and the performance of unauthorized rites, and to "an ever-deepening corruption of the national faith" (Ewald). Cf. <a href="/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>. But the meaning is, it became an occasion of sin to the people ("<span class="accented">Quod fuit postea causa gravissimi peccati" -</span> Vatab.) Jeroboam "<span class="accented">made</span> <span class="accented">Israel to sin"</span> (<a href="/1_kings/14-16.htm">1 Kings 14:16</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-26.htm">1 Kings 15:26</a>, etc.) It is difficult to conceive, in the face of these and similar words, how any one can seriously maintain that "the church of Israel was the national church" (Stanley, 2:264) ]: <span class="cmt_word">for the people went to worship before the one even unto Dan.</span> [The people frequented both sanctuaries; why, then, is that at Dan especially mentioned? Some (Rawlinson, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>.) have suggested that the text is here corrupt, and that we should read, "before the one to Bethel, and before the other to Dan." According to others, "the one" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) refers to the double <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> ("the one," "the other"); cf. ver. 29. They would interpret, that is, "the people went to both, even to the distant Dan" (Bahr, Thenius). Keil would force the text and understand, "the people, even unto Dan," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the people throughout the whole kingdom. Similarly, Wordsworth. Ewald understands "before the one" to mean <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "<span class="accented">as one</span>," <span class="accented">sc</span>. man. On the whole it is better to take the words as they stand, literally. It is quite conceivable that, at first, the people resorted almost exclusively to the Danite sanctuary. Having been for long years a seat of worship, and having probably its "house of high places," or temple (see below), already built, it would naturally be in a position to receive worshippers some time before Bethel was prepared for that purpose. Jeroboam's offering in person at Bethel (ver. 32) which marks the inauguration of his new ritual there, may have been partly designed to attract worshippers to a shrine, which, as being nearer Jerusalem, or for some other reason, was neglected. But the verse is patient of another interpretation. It may intend to convey that the rebellious tribes, in their defiant disregard of the old order of things, the order now represented by a hostile kingdom, went <span class="accented">en masse</span> to the opposite point of the compass, even to the unhallowed and hitherto despised sanctuary of the Danites. The LXX. (Vat.) addition here is noticeable, "And they forsook the house of the Lord."] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/12-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
