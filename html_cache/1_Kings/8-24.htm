The promise referred to is found in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, where God assures David that his lineage will endure and that his son will build the temple. This covenant is central to the Davidic line, which is significant in biblical history as it leads to the birth of Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise. The phrase underscores the importance of divine faithfulness and the reliability of God's word, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3-4</a>).<p><b>What You spoke with Your mouth</b><br>This part emphasizes the verbal nature of God's promises, reflecting the power and authority of God's word. In biblical times, spoken words were binding and carried significant weight, especially when uttered by God. The phrase suggests that God's declarations are not mere human promises but divine decrees that are certain to come to pass. This is consistent with passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, which speaks of God's word accomplishing what He desires.<p><b>You have fulfilled with Your hand this day.</b><br>The fulfillment "with Your hand" indicates God's active involvement in bringing His promises to fruition. The "hand" of God is often used metaphorically in Scripture to denote His power and intervention in human affairs (e.g., <a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>). The phrase "this day" marks the specific moment when Solomon acknowledges the completion of the temple, a tangible sign of God's faithfulness. This fulfillment is not only a historical event but also a foreshadowing of the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, who is both the descendant of David and the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and the king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem.

The Lord&#8217;s promises flow toward humble hearts that recognize His supremacy (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling David &#8220;Your servant&#8221; reinforces that the covenant was grace, not entitlement.<p>&#8226; It encourages us to embrace the same servant identity (<a href="/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>), positioning ourselves for God&#8217;s ongoing work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my father David.</b><p>Solomon ties the fulfillment directly to his earthly lineage, underscoring the generational reach of God&#8217;s covenants (<a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3-4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/23-5.htm">2 Samuel 23:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s dealings with David ripple into Solomon&#8217;s moment and will ultimately climax in Christ, &#8220;the Son of David&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s promises outlive the people who first receive them; our faithfulness today blesses children and grandchildren (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What You spoke with Your mouth</b><p>God&#8217;s spoken word is creative and authoritative (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>).
