The construction of a royal palace signifies the wealth and power of Solomon's reign, as well as the importance of establishing a stable and impressive seat of government. The palace's location, likely within the city of Jerusalem, underscores the city's central role in Israel's political and spiritual life. Solomon's palace would have been a place of administration and governance, reflecting his role as a king who was both a political and spiritual leader.<p><b>set further back</b><br>The positioning of Solomon's palace "set further back" suggests a strategic placement, possibly for security reasons or to signify the separation between the sacred space of the Temple and the secular authority of the king. This spatial arrangement may reflect the biblical principle of distinguishing between the sacred and the secular, a theme seen throughout Scripture. The placement could also indicate a hierarchy of importance, with the Temple taking precedence over the king's residence.<p><b>was of similar construction</b><br>The phrase "of similar construction" implies that Solomon's palace shared architectural features with other significant buildings of the time, possibly including the Temple itself. This similarity could reflect a unified aesthetic or a demonstration of the king's resources and craftsmanship. The use of similar materials and design elements would have conveyed a sense of continuity and stability in Solomon's reign, as well as the interconnectedness of the king's authority and religious devotion.<p><b>He also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter</b><br>This part of the verse highlights Solomon's marriage alliance with Egypt, one of the major powers of the ancient world. The construction of a separate palace for Pharaoh's daughter signifies the importance of this political alliance and the influence of foreign relations on Israel's domestic affairs. Marriages to foreign princesses were common among ancient Near Eastern kings to secure peace and strengthen political ties. This alliance with Egypt, however, also foreshadows potential spiritual compromises, as foreign influences could lead to idolatry, a recurring issue in Israel's history.<p><b>whom he had married</b><br>Solomon's marriage to Pharaoh's daughter is a significant event, reflecting the king's political acumen but also hinting at future spiritual challenges. While such alliances were politically advantageous, they often brought foreign religious practices into Israel, which could lead to idolatry and a departure from exclusive worship of Yahweh. This marriage is a precursor to Solomon's later struggles with maintaining faithfulness to God, as seen in his eventual accumulation of many wives and concubines, which led his heart astray. Solomon's marriages serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of compromising one's faith for political or personal gain.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wisdom and for building the temple in Jerusalem.

This is further explained by saying that they had costly stones of great size in the foundation, and stones above, hewn and sawn from top to bottom, carefully finished on the outside towards the great court, as well as on the inside, and were in all cases roofed with cedar. Josephus tells us that the inner court was adorned with trees and fountains, and had colonnades round it; and gives an enthusiastic description of the internal decoration of the rooms, panelled up to a certain height with polished marble, with a band of highly-wrought metal-work of foliage of all kinds above this, and the rest of the wall up to the ceiling plastered and painted in colours ("ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion." <a href="/jeremiah/22-14.htm" title="That said, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cuts him out windows; and it is paneled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.">Jeremiah 22:14</a>).
