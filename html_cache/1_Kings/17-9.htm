Zarephath is located in the region of Sidon, a Phoenician city outside of Israel's borders. This is significant because it shows God's sovereignty and provision extending beyond Israel, foreshadowing the inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan of salvation. The journey to Zarephath would have been long and arduous, emphasizing Elijah's obedience and trust in God's provision. Zarephath, meaning "smelting place," symbolizes a place of refining, both for Elijah and the widow he is about to meet. This area is also the homeland of Jezebel, Ahab's wife, highlighting the irony and challenge of God sending Elijah into enemy territory.<p><b>Behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.</b><br>Widows in ancient times were often among the most vulnerable and impoverished, lacking a male protector or provider. God's choice of a widow to sustain Elijah underscores His power to use the weak and unlikely to fulfill His purposes. This act of provision is a testament to God's faithfulness and a reminder of His care for the marginalized. The widow's obedience to God's command, despite her dire circumstances, is a powerful example of faith and trust. This narrative prefigures the New Testament account of Jesus commending the faith of a widow who gave all she had (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>). Additionally, this story is referenced by Jesus in <a href="/luke/4-25.htm">Luke 4:25-26</a>, where He highlights God's grace extending to Gentiles, challenging the exclusivity of His audience's understanding of God's favor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God, known for his faithfulness and miraculous works.

God is sending His prophet behind &#8220;enemy lines.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus highlights this very episode to illustrate God&#8217;s grace extending beyond Israel: &#8220;There were many widows in Israel&#8230;yet Elijah was sent&#8230;to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-25.htm">Luke 4:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; The instruction proves the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty over all lands, echoing His later movement toward Gentile areas in <a href="/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21-28</a>.

Long before Elijah arrives, the Lord is arranging the details (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>).<p>&#8226; This hidden preparation highlights that God works on both ends of every obedience story&#8212;He instructs the servant and readies the receiver.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To provide for you</b><p>Provision comes from an unexpected place.<p>&#8226; Elijah, the great prophet, must depend on a poor foreign woman.

Hence it has been identified with a modern village, <span class= "ital">Surafend</span>, in that position. The words, "which belongeth to Zidon," appear to be emphatic, marking the striking providence of God, which, when the land of Israel was apostate and unsafe, found for the prophet a refuge and a welcome in a heathen country, which was moreover the native place of his deadliest enemy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Arise, get thee to Zarephath</span> [Cf. <a href="/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 1:20</a>.
