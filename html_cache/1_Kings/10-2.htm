The spices of "the incensebearing sands" of Arabia are constantly dwelt upon both in Greek and Roman literature. Frankincense especially was imported from Arabia into Palestine (see <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm" title="The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm" title="To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.">Jeremiah 6:20</a>), although now it comes chiefly from India. Myrrh also was in ancient times drawn chiefly from Arabia. Cassia is a product of Arabia and India.

Gold is not now known to exist in Arabia, nor any precious stones except the onyx and the emerald. But in ancient times it was commonly believed to produce both gold and precious stones largely.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she came to Jerusalem</span> [a great undertaking in those days.

Thenius understands the words of an armed escort, which may well have been necessary considering the countries through which she passed, and the treasures she carried. It would also be quite in the spirit of the age that the queen should be escorted by a band of her soldiers.

It does not, however, decide against an armed force, as camels would be in any case required. The camel was a familiar object to the Jews (<a href="/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-7.htm">Deuteronomy 14:7</a>, etc.); but such a procession as this would create great astonishment in Jerusalem, and we may imagine how the people would line the bazaars as she passed, and the acclamations with which they would greet the queen (cf. 1:40; <a href="/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>) and her swart attendants] <span class="cmt_word">that bare spices</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">balsams</span>; hence spices generally; LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. <a href="/exodus/25-6.htm">Exodus 25:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/35-28.htm">Exodus 35:28</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>.

Bib. 1. p. 707). It is quite possible, however, that much of the "gold of Arabia" came to its emporiums from other lands. This particular present was doubtless brought by the queen because she had heard of the extensive use made of it by Solomon, and of the enormous quantities he required.
