He was known for his loyalty and bravery, having previously served under King David. Benaiah's role as the commander of the army signifies his high status and trustworthiness. His leadership in the military was crucial during a time when Israel was establishing itself as a powerful kingdom. Benaiah's exploits, such as his defeat of the two sons of Ariel of Moab and his killing of a lion in a pit on a snowy day, are recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20-23</a>, highlighting his valor and skill. His appointment reflects the continuity of David's legacy through Solomon's reign, as Benaiah was a key supporter during Solomon's ascension to the throne (<a href="/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38-39</a>). This continuity is significant in maintaining stability and fulfilling God's promise to David regarding his dynasty (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>Zadok and Abiathar were priests;</b><br>Zadok and Abiathar served as priests during the early part of Solomon's reign, representing the religious leadership of Israel. Zadok, a descendant of Aaron through Eleazar, was a faithful priest who supported Solomon during the struggle for the throne against Adonijah (<a href="/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8</a>). His loyalty was rewarded with a prominent position in Solomon's administration. Abiathar, on the other hand, was a descendant of Eli and had served David faithfully. However, his support for Adonijah's claim to the throne led to his eventual removal from the priesthood (<a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26-27</a>). This fulfilled the prophecy against the house of Eli (<a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31-35</a>), demonstrating God's sovereignty and the importance of faithfulness to His chosen leaders. The dual mention of Zadok and Abiathar highlights the transitional period in Israel's priesthood, where God's purposes were being worked out through the political and religious shifts of the time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benaiah_son_of_jehoiada.htm">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</a></b><br>A valiant warrior and loyal supporter of King Solomon, Benaiah was appointed as the commander of the army.

Those exploits mark him as a man of faith and valor who trusted the Lord in impossible situations.<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s decision in <a href="/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a> to set Benaiah over the army &#8220;in place of Joab&#8221; reveals more than a change in leadership; it shows the king&#8217;s commitment to righteousness. Joab&#8217;s unchecked violence had stained Israel (<a href="/1_kings/2-31.htm">1 Kings 2:31&#8211;33</a>), whereas Benaiah&#8217;s record was clean. By installing a godly commander, Solomon strengthens his throne in line with <a href="/proverbs/20-28.htm">Proverbs 20:28</a> and <a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3&#8211;4</a>.<p>&#8226; The verse affirms God&#8217;s faithfulness in rewarding integrity. Benaiah served David humbly (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5&#8211;6</a>), stood by Solomon during the fraught succession (<a href="/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38&#8211;40</a>), and ultimately received lasting honor. His story echoes <a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>&#8212;&#8220;Well done, good and faithful servant&#8230;You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For us, Benaiah illustrates how courage, loyalty, and obedience pave the way for larger responsibilities in God&#8217;s timing (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zadok and Abiathar were priests</b><p>&#8226; Under David, Zadok and Abiathar faithfully carried the ark (<a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24&#8211;29</a>) and served as spiritual advisors (<a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>). Listing both men here shows that, early in Solomon&#8217;s reign, the priesthood still included representatives from Aaron&#8217;s lines through Eleazar (Zadok) and Ithamar (Abiathar), fulfilling the Mosaic pattern (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Zadok&#8217;s loyalty to God&#8217;s chosen king never wavered (<a href="/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>). As a result, he was later confirmed as sole high priest (<a href="/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>), fulfilling the prophecy given to Eli centuries earlier that his unfaithful house would lose its privileged role (<a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; Abiathar, though once courageous (<a href="/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20&#8211;23</a>), compromised by backing Adonijah&#8217;s coup (<a href="/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7</a>). Solomon spared his life &#8220;because you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father David&#8221; yet removed him from office (<a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26&#8211;27</a>). Abiathar&#8217;s downfall underscores that past service does not excuse present disobedience (<a href="/ezekiel/18-24.htm">Ezekiel 18:24</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Together, these two names remind readers that spiritual leadership is both a high privilege and a grave responsibility. God honors fidelity (<a href="/psalms/101-6.htm">Psalm 101:6</a>) and judges infidelity, even in those once greatly used.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/4-4.htm">1 Kings 4:4</a> presents more than a roster of officials; it testifies to God&#8217;s unchanging standard of integrity in civil and spiritual leadership. Benaiah models steadfast courage rewarded with greater trust, while Zadok and Abiathar illustrate how faithfulness secures lasting honor and compromise forfeits it. The verse invites modern readers to embrace the same wholehearted loyalty to God and His appointed order, confident that He still exalts the upright and humbles the unfaithful.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Zadok and Abiathar </span>. . . <span class= "bld">the priests.</span>--Abiathar, though disgraced and practically deposed, was still regarded theoretically as priest (much as Annas is called "high priest" in the Gospels), for the priesthood was properly for life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada</span> [see on 1 Kings 1:32] <span class="cmt_word">was</span> [the A.
