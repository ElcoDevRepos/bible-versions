Solomon's wisdom, granted by God (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>), is demonstrated in his ability to discern the truth in difficult situations. This moment is a fulfillment of God's promise to give Solomon a wise and discerning heart, setting a precedent for his reign.<p><b>&#8220;Give the living baby to the first woman:</b><br>The context of this ruling involves two women claiming to be the mother of the same child. Solomon's decision to give the baby to the first woman reveals his insight into human nature and maternal instincts. This reflects the cultural importance of motherhood and the value placed on life in ancient Israel. The decision also underscores the biblical principle of justice and mercy.<p><b>By no means should you kill him;</b><br>This command emphasizes the sanctity of life, a core biblical value. The preservation of the child's life aligns with the broader scriptural theme that life is a gift from God (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). Solomon's ruling avoids the potential tragedy of infanticide, which was not uncommon in ancient times, and instead upholds the dignity and worth of the child.<p><b>she is his mother.&#8221;</b><br>Solomon's declaration identifies the true mother through her willingness to sacrifice her claim to save her child's life. This reflects the deep, sacrificial love that is often associated with motherhood. The resolution of this case not only demonstrates Solomon's wisdom but also points to the deeper truth of God's love for His children, as seen in the sacrificial nature of Christ (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). Solomon's wisdom here can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate wisdom and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, which he received from God.
