The "word of God" often signifies a message of guidance, correction, or prophecy. In the context of <a href="/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>, it underscores the authority and divine origin of the message that follows. This phrase is reminiscent of other instances where God&#8217;s word comes to His prophets, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>, emphasizing the continuity of God&#8217;s communication with His chosen messengers.<p><b>came to Shemaiah</b><br>Shemaiah is identified as a prophet, though not much is known about him outside of this context. His role here is crucial as he delivers a pivotal message from God. The name Shemaiah means "heard by God," which is fitting for a prophet who receives and conveys God's word. This highlights the importance of prophets in Israel as intermediaries between God and His people, similar to figures like Nathan and Gad in the time of David.<p><b>the man of God</b><br>This title is often used in the Old Testament to describe prophets and other individuals who are dedicated to God's service, such as Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-18.htm">1 Kings 17:18</a>). It signifies a person who is not only a messenger but also lives in accordance with God's will. The use of this title for Shemaiah underscores his authority and the authenticity of the message he delivers. It also reflects the respect and reverence given to those who faithfully serve God, setting them apart as His representatives on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shemaiah.htm">Shemaiah</a></b><br>A prophet referred to as "the man of God."

And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.">2Chronicles 12:15</a>, it would seem that, while Ahijah belonged to Shiloh in Ephraim, and continued to dwell there, Shemaiah was rather attached to Judah, and hence, that his interference to protect the new kingdom was the more striking and unexpected. In this interposition, to which probably the very preservation of Jeroboam's half-formed kingdom was due, there is a fresh indication of the great opportunity given to that kingdom to maintain itself, under the blessing of God and in devotion to His service. The phrase "your brethren, the children of Israel," marks this with much emphasis.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the word of God came unto Shemaiah</span> [This part of the history is probably derived from the "book" which this prophet wrote (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-15.htm">2 Chronicles 12:15</a>).
