The number of stalls indicates a significant investment in military resources, as chariots were a crucial part of ancient warfare. The use of chariots in battle is mentioned in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in the battles of the Israelites against the Canaanites. The large number of stalls suggests a well-organized and maintained military infrastructure. Archaeological findings in the region, such as those at Megiddo, have uncovered stables that could accommodate large numbers of horses, supporting the biblical account of Solomon's extensive resources.<p><b>and 12,000 horses.</b><br>The mention of 12,000 horses further emphasizes Solomon's military capabilities and the prosperity of his kingdom. Horses were valuable assets in ancient times, used for both warfare and transportation. The number 12,000 signifies not only military might but also the administrative ability to manage such a large number of animals. This aligns with the biblical portrayal of Solomon as a wise and capable ruler. The accumulation of horses, however, also reflects a deviation from the Deuteronomic law, which advised kings not to multiply horses for themselves (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>). This could be seen as a foreshadowing of Solomon's later departure from some of God's commands. Solomon's reign, with its peace and prosperity, is often seen as a type of the future Messianic kingdom, where Christ will reign with perfect wisdom and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.

They were kept in various "chariot cities," as well as at Jerusalem. This multiplication of horses and horsemen--forbidden to the future king in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm" title="But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: for as much as the LORD has said to you, You shall from now on return no more that way.">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, but foretold by Samuel at the inauguration of the kingdom (<a href="/context/1_samuel/8-11.htm" title="And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.">1Samuel 8:11-12</a>)--is significant of military conquest and an extended empire. The Israelite armies, in frequent contradistinction from their enemies, had been hitherto mainly of infantry; and in <a href="/joshua/11-9.htm" title="And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him: he hamstrung their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.">Joshua 11:9</a> the chariots and horses captured were not used, but destroyed, "as the Lord bade Joshua." Such armies were powerful for defence, not for invasion. Now, as it would seem for the first time, this provision of the ancient law, like many others, was set aside, and Solomon's empire assumed the character of other great Oriental monarchies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses</span> [40,000 is certainly a clerical error, probably for 4000 (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). For <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the parallel passage in Chronicles the number is stated as 4000. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> 4000 agrees, and 40,000 does not, with the other numbers here given. <p>The chariots, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, numbered 1400; the horsemen 12,000. Now for 1400 chariots the proper allowance of horses would be about 4000. We see from the monuments that it was customary to yoke two horses (seldom three) to a chariot; but a third or supernumerary horse was provided to meet emergencies or accidents. 4000 horses would hence be a liberal provision for Solomon's chariots, and it would also agree well with the number of his cavalry. 12,000 cavalry and 40,000 chariot horses are out of all proportion. As to stalls, it seems clear that in ancient, as in modern times, each horse had a separate crib (Vegetins in Bochart, quoted by Keil). Gesenius, however, understands by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5bb;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, not <span class="accented">stalls</span>, but <span class="accented">teams</span>, or <span class="accented">pairs</span>] <span class="cmt_word">for his chariots</span> [or <span class="accented">chariotry</span>: the word is singular and collective] <span class="cmt_word">and twelve hundred horsemen</span> [rather, <span class="accented">horses, i.e.</span>, riding or cavalry, as distinguished from chariot horses above. See note on 1 Kings 1:5. It has been supposed that this warlike provision is mentioned to account for the peace ("<span class="accented">si vis pacem, para bellum"</span>) of Solomon's reign, and was designed to overawe the tributary kings. But it is more probable that the idea of the historian was, partly to exhibit the pomp and circumstance of Israel's greatest king, and partly to record a contravention of the law (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>), which was one of the precursors of his fall]. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/4-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Solomon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1465;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#353;&#183;l&#333;&#183;m&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
