Prophets in the Old Testament often delivered messages from God, serving as His mouthpiece. The act of crying out indicates urgency and the importance of the message. Prophets were often called to speak against idolatry and disobedience to God's commands.<p><b>by the word of the LORD</b><br>This emphasizes the divine origin of the prophecy. The phrase "word of the LORD" is a common biblical expression indicating that the message is not of human origin but is a direct revelation from God. This underscores the authority and reliability of the prophecy.<p><b>against the altar in Bethel</b><br>Bethel was a significant religious site in the Northern Kingdom of Israel. King Jeroboam had set up a golden calf there, leading the people into idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-29</a>). The altar in Bethel became a symbol of Israel's apostasy. The prophecy against it highlights God's judgment on false worship and idolatry.<p><b>and against all the shrines on the high places</b><br>High places were locations often used for idol worship and unauthorized sacrifices, contrary to God's command to worship only at the temple in Jerusalem. These shrines represented the widespread nature of idolatry in Israel. The prophecy condemns these practices and foretells their destruction.<p><b>in the cities of Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The mention of Samaria indicates that the idolatry and false worship were pervasive throughout the kingdom, not just localized to Bethel. This highlights the extent of Israel's departure from true worship.<p><b>will surely come to pass.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase assures the certainty of the prophecy's fulfillment. Biblical prophecies often include a guarantee of their realization, reflecting God's sovereignty and faithfulness. The fulfillment of this prophecy is seen later in <a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15-20</a>, when King Josiah destroys the altar at Bethel, demonstrating God's judgment and the reliability of His word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>A prophet from Judah who was sent by God to Bethel to deliver a message against the altar that King Jeroboam had set up.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A city in the northern kingdom of Israel where King Jeroboam established a center of idol worship, contrary to God's commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_jeroboam.htm">King Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel who led the people into idolatry by setting up golden calves in Bethel and Dan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_in_bethel.htm">The Altar in Bethel</a></b><br>An unauthorized altar built by Jeroboam for idol worship, which the man of God prophesied against.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_places_in_the_cities_of_samaria.htm">The High Places in the Cities of Samaria</a></b><br>Locations throughout the northern kingdom where unauthorized worship practices were conducted, which were condemned by the prophet.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_god's_word.htm">The Certainty of God's Word</a></b><br>God's pronouncements through His prophets are sure and will come to pass, as seen in the eventual destruction of the altar at Bethel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to spiritual decay and judgment.
