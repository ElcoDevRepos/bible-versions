The concept of being God's "people" and "inheritance" is rooted in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>), where God promises to make Abraham's descendants a great nation. The term "inheritance" signifies a special possession, highlighting the Israelites' unique status among the nations. This relationship is further affirmed in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, where Israel is described as a holy people chosen by God. The idea of being God's inheritance also points to the responsibility of the Israelites to live according to His laws and statutes, reflecting His holiness to the world.<p><b>You brought them out of Egypt,</b><br>This phrase recalls the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history where God delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. This act of deliverance is a central theme throughout the Old Testament, symbolizing God's power, faithfulness, and commitment to His promises. The Exodus is frequently referenced in the Psalms and the Prophets as a demonstration of God's mighty hand and outstretched arm (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). It serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where Jesus delivers believers from the bondage of sin (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>).<p><b>out of the furnace for iron.</b><br>The "furnace for iron" metaphorically describes the harsh conditions of slavery in Egypt. This imagery conveys the intense suffering and oppression the Israelites endured, akin to the refining process of iron in a furnace. The use of this metaphor highlights God's role as a deliverer who rescues His people from affliction. In a broader biblical context, the furnace is often associated with trials and purification (<a href="/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>), suggesting that the Israelites' experience in Egypt was a period of testing and preparation for their identity as God's chosen nation. This concept of deliverance from a "furnace" can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who refines and purifies believers through His sacrifice (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who is offering a prayer of dedication for the newly built temple in Jerusalem.

It implies the belief not only that the declared purpose of God cannot fail, but that, even for the manifestation of His glory to man, it must needs be visibly fulfilled before the eyes of the world. This same conviction breathes in many of the utterances of Moses for Israel (see <a href="/context/exodus/32-12.htm" title="Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.">Exodus 32:12-13</a>; <a href="/context/numbers/14-13.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for you brought up this people in your might from among them;)">Numbers 14:13-14</a>); it is expressed in the "Help us, O Lord, and deliver us for Thy name's sake," of <a href="/context/psalms/79-9.htm" title="Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for your name's sake.">Psalm 79:9-10</a>, or the "Defer not for Thine own sake, O my God" of <a href="/daniel/9-19.htm" title="O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, listen and do; defer not, for your own sake, O my God: for your city and your people are called by your name.">Daniel 9:19</a> : it is declared on the part, of the Lord again and again in <a href="/ezekiel/20-9.htm" title="But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 20:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-14.htm" title="But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.">Ezekiel 20:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-22.htm" title="Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.">Ezekiel 20:22</a>, "I wrought for my name's sake." It may, indeed, seem to jar upon our fuller conception of the infinite majesty of God, incapable of being augmented or lessened, and of the infinite love which does all for the sake of His creatures. Yet it is not wholly unlike our Lord's prayer (<a href="/john/12-28.htm" title="Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.">John 12:28</a>), "Father, glorify thy name," or the Apostolic declarations of the great purpose of redemption, as designed for "the praise of God's glory" (<a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm" title="To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved.">Ephesians 1:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-12.htm" title="That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.">Ephesians 1:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>), and of all Christian life as commanded to "do all to the glory of God" (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm" title="Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.">1Corinthians 10:31</a>). In some respects it is like the pleading with our Lord, in the Litanies of the Church in all ages, by all the various acts of His redemption, and the prayer of the old Latin hymn-- . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they be thy people</span> [a citation or reminiscence of <a href="/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt</span> [cf. vers. 21, 53.
