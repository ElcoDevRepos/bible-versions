Joab, a seasoned military commander and nephew of David, had been a key figure in David's reign, known for his military prowess and sometimes ruthless actions. His support for Adonijah indicates a significant political maneuver, as Joab's influence and military experience could lend credibility and strength to Adonijah's claim. This alliance reflects the complex power dynamics within David's court, where loyalty was often divided, and personal ambition could lead to political intrigue.<p><b>and with Abiathar the priest</b><br>Abiathar was a high priest during David's reign and had been loyal to David during Absalom's rebellion. His support for Adonijah is notable, as it represents a significant religious endorsement. Abiathar's involvement suggests that Adonijah's claim to the throne was not only a political move but also had religious implications. This alliance with a high-ranking religious figure could have been intended to legitimize Adonijah's claim in the eyes of the people, as the priesthood held considerable influence in Israelite society.<p><b>who supported him</b><br>The support of Joab and Abiathar for Adonijah highlights the division within David's kingdom as his reign neared its end. Their backing suggests that Adonijah's bid for the throne was not a mere personal ambition but had substantial support from key figures in the military and religious sectors. This division foreshadows the eventual conflict over the succession, as Solomon, David's chosen heir, would later face opposition from those who had aligned with Adonijah. The narrative underscores the theme of divine providence and the fulfillment of God's promises, as Solomon's eventual accession to the throne aligns with God's covenant with David, pointing to the establishment of a kingdom that would ultimately lead to the coming of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The fourth son of King David, who sought to become king as David's health declined.

He stands out in consistent portraiture throughout, as a bold, hard, and unscrupulous man; in his relations to the king often imperious and disobedient; but nevertheless an absolutely loyal servant, to whom, in great degree, the establishment of David's throne was due, and who, moreover (as is shown by his remonstrance against the numbering of the people, recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/24-3.htm" title="And Joab said to the king, Now the LORD your God add to the people, how many soever they be, an hundred times, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?">2Samuel 24:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-3.htm" title="And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then does my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?">1Chronicles 21:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-6.htm" title="But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.">1Chronicles 21:6</a>), was not without some right instincts of policy and of duty to God.<p><span class= "bld">Abiathar the priest</span>.--Of Abiathar we also know that he had been the companion of all David's adversity, and of his reign at Hebron (<a href="/1_samuel/22-20.htm" title="And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.">1Samuel 22:20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/23-6.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.">1Samuel 23:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/23-9.htm" title="And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.">1Samuel 23:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-7.htm" title="And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod.

He must have known that he was under David's displeasure, and he must have feared, too, that he would be an object of dislike and distrust to a successor trained, as Solomon had been, under David's and Nathan's immediate influence. He could hardly be unconscious that under a new reign his position - unless he took measures to assure it - would be a precarious one. He resolved, therefore, to secure himself by helping Adonijah to his throne. It is also highly probable that Adonijah's ambitious character was much more to his liking than that of the pious and pacific Solomon. Adonijah's physical qualities, again, would no doubt commend him to this rough soldier, who may also have sympathised with him as the eldest son.

An obvious transposition] <span class="cmt_word">the priest.</span> ["Abiathar's defection is still more surprising" than Joab's (Rawlinson). It is certainly remarkable, when we consider the close ties which subsisted between Abiathar and David, ties which were cemented by the blood of eighty-five persons (<a href="/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18</a>), and strengthened by the many afflictions which they had shared in common (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 23 to 1 Kings 28; <a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-29</a>), that he should have joined in a plot to defeat David's cherished hopes and plans - plans, too, which he must surely have known, had the sanction of religion (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>), and there must have been some powerful motive to account for this. May we not find one in jealousy of Zadok, who had for some time been associated with him in the priesthood, who is generally mentioned first (<a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-29.htm">2 Samuel 15:29, 35, 36</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>). as if he were the more important and influential, and whose advancement, after the prophecy of <a href="/1_samuel/2-33.htm">1 Samuel 2:33-36</a>, Abiathar could not contemplate without suspicion and dread. Is it not highly probable that among the "words" Adonijah had with him was a promise to restore the priesthood to his family exclusively, as the reward of his allegiance]: <span class="cmt_word">and they following Adonijah helped him</span> (lit., as marg., "helped after Adonijah." It is a pregnant construction, "they aided having followed the side of Adonijah" (Gesenius). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/1-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So [Adonijah]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yih&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
