His reign is noted for its military campaigns and political maneuvers. Baasha came to power by assassinating Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, fulfilling the prophecy against Jeroboam's house (<a href="/1_kings/15-29.htm">1 Kings 15:29</a>). His acts include fortifying the city of Ramah to control access to Jerusalem, which led to conflict with Asa, king of Judah (<a href="/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17</a>).<p><b>along with his accomplishments and might</b><br>Baasha's accomplishments include his military strength and strategic fortifications. His might is demonstrated in his ability to maintain control over Israel for 24 years, a significant period for a king who came to power through a coup. However, his reign was marked by idolatry and disobedience to God, which ultimately led to his downfall and the prophecy against his house (<a href="/1_kings/16.htm">1 Kings 16:1-4</a>).<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</b><br>This phrase indicates that there were other historical records, now lost, that detailed the reigns of the kings of Israel. The Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel is distinct from the biblical books of Chronicles and served as a royal archive. This reference underscores the historical nature of the biblical narrative and suggests that the biblical account is a summary of more extensive records.

Scripture doesn&#8217;t exhaustively record everything, but it affirms that much more could be told.<p>&#8226; By recording only the events necessary for God&#8217;s purposes, the text models <a href="/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>, where the apostle says, &#8220;Jesus did many other things as well,&#8221; yet what is written is sufficient for faith and obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with his accomplishments and might</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Accomplishments&#8221; points to the tangible results of Baasha&#8217;s reign&#8212;fortifying Ramah (<a href="/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17</a>), expanding territory, imposing taxes.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Might&#8221; highlights his military strength; he rose from a commoner in Issachar (<a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27</a>) to overthrow King Nadab and then hold Israel for 24 years.<p>&#8226; The wording mirrors earlier notices about kings such as Rehoboam (<a href="/1_kings/14-22.htm">1 Kings 14:22&#8211;24</a>) and Asa (<a href="/1_kings/15-23.htm">1 Kings 15:23</a>), reminding us that God keeps track of every leader&#8217;s deeds, whether good or evil (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Even though Baasha&#8217;s &#8220;might&#8221; looked impressive, <a href="/1_kings/16-7.htm">1 Kings 16:7</a> states that the LORD judged him for leading Israel into sin&#8212;illustrating <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>: &#8220;There is no wisdom, no understanding, and no plan that can prevail against the LORD.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</b><p>&#8226; This rhetorical question points readers to an external royal record&#8212;an official state archive that has since been lost, much like the &#8220;Book of Jashar&#8221; cited in <a href="/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>.<p>&#8226; The reference underscores God&#8217;s sovereign oversight: what human scribes recorded in their annals, God has preserved permanently in His inspired Word (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>).<p>&#8226; By mentioning another source, Scripture invites us to value historical accuracy.
