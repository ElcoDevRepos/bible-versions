The temple was central to Israelite worship, symbolizing God's presence among His people. Solomon's involvement underscores his wisdom and dedication to fulfilling God's promises to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). The temple's furnishings were crafted with precision, reflecting the divine instructions given to Moses for the tabernacle (Exodus 25-27), indicating continuity in worship practices.<p><b>the golden altar:</b><br>The golden altar, also known as the altar of incense, was placed in the Holy Place before the veil separating it from the Most Holy Place.

The use of gold signifies purity and divinity, aligning with the temple's purpose as a holy dwelling for God. This altar connects to the tabernacle's design (<a href="/exodus/30.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a>) and foreshadows Christ's intercessory role (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>the golden table on which was placed the Bread of the Presence:</b><br>The golden table, or the Table of Showbread, held the Bread of the Presence, which consisted of twelve loaves representing the twelve tribes of Israel (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>). This bread was a continual offering, signifying God's provision and covenant with His people. The table's gold construction emphasizes the sacredness of God's provision.

Because Scripture is accurate and literal, we can trust that Solomon&#8217;s craftsmen produced every item exactly as God intended. The phrase &#8220;all the furnishings&#8221; reminds us that worship is not a haphazard activity; every detail matters when we approach a holy God (<a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/4-19.htm">2 Chronicles 4:19</a>).

On it (see <a href="/context/exodus/30-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar to burn incense on: of shittim wood shall you make it.">Exodus 30:1-10</a>) incense was to be burnt morning and evening. The horns of the altar were to be touched with the blood of the sin offering (<a href="/leviticus/4-7.htm" title="And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 4:7</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-18.htm" title="And he shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 4:18</a>) offered for the priests or the people; and it was to be solemnly purified by the blood of the sacrifice on the great Day of Atonement (<a href="/context/leviticus/16-18.htm" title="And he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar round about.">Leviticus 16:18-19</a>). The offering of incense, therefore, pre-supposed sacrifice already offered, and atonement made for sin. To the Israelites it clearly symbolised the offering of an acceptable worship by man, as restored to the love and communion of God. (See <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm" title="Let my prayer be set forth before you as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.">Psalm 141:2</a>.) The priest, as a mediator between God and man, alone entered the Holy Place and offered the incense; the people "stood praying without" (<a href="/luke/1-10.htm" title="And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.">Luke 1:10</a>). To us it symbolises the intercession of the One Mediator, offered for us in the Most Holy Place of heaven, by whom alone our worship ascends to God. (See <a href="/context/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>; <a href="/context/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.">Revelation 8:3</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">Solomon made all the vessels which pertained unto</span> [neither word in Heb.] <span class="cmt_word">the house of the Lord: the altar of gold</span> [the altar of incense.
