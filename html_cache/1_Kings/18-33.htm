The arrangement of the wood is a critical step in preparing the altar for sacrifice. This act signifies order and intentionality, reflecting the careful preparation required for worship and sacrifice. The wood symbolizes the foundation upon which the sacrifice will be made, pointing to the necessity of a proper foundation in spiritual practices. In a broader biblical context, wood is often associated with sacrifice, as seen in the wood of the cross upon which Jesus was crucified, highlighting the connection between Old Testament sacrifices and the ultimate sacrifice of Christ.<p><b>cut up the bull</b><br>The bull was a common sacrificial animal in ancient Israel, representing atonement and reconciliation with God. Cutting up the bull was a standard procedure in preparing a burnt offering, as outlined in Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/1-6.htm">Leviticus 1:6</a>). This act signifies the seriousness of the sacrifice and the need for a complete offering to God. The bull, as a symbol of strength and service, can also be seen as a type of Christ, who offered Himself completely for the sins of humanity. The meticulous preparation of the bull underscores the importance of obedience to God's instructions in worship.<p><b>placed it on the wood</b><br>Placing the bull on the wood completes the preparation for the sacrifice. This act signifies the readiness for divine intervention and the expectation of God's response. In the narrative, Elijah's actions contrast sharply with the prophets of Baal, who failed to elicit a response from their god. The placement of the sacrifice on the wood can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice on the cross, where He was "placed" as the ultimate offering for sin. This phrase also emphasizes the necessity of faith and trust in God's power to act, as Elijah confidently prepares for God to reveal Himself to the people of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who played a pivotal role in challenging the prophets of Baal and demonstrating the power of the one true God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_carmel.htm">Mount Carmel</a></b><br>The location where Elijah confronted the prophets of Baal and called upon God to demonstrate His power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_of_baal.htm">Prophets of Baal</a></b><br>Pagan prophets who worshiped Baal, a false god, and were challenged by Elijah to prove the power of their deity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bull.htm">The Bull</a></b><br>The sacrificial animal used by Elijah to demonstrate God's power over Baal.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The structure on which the sacrifice was placed, symbolizing worship and dedication to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Elijah's actions demonstrate a profound faith in God.

After rebuilding the altar (<a href="/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30&#8211;32</a>), he didn&#8217;t rush or improvise. The sequence matters&#8212;just as Noah built the ark &#8220;according to all that God commanded him&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>) and Moses erected the tabernacle &#8220;exactly as the LORD had commanded&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>). Scripture consistently shows that God honors careful obedience carried out in His order, and Elijah models that principle here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He arranged the wood</b><p>Elijah lays the fuel so the fire, when God sends it, can consume the sacrifice entirely. This mirrors the prescribed pattern for burnt offerings in <a href="/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7</a>, where the priest &#8220;shall arrange the wood on the fire.&#8221; By arranging the wood before anything else, Elijah demonstrates faith that God will supply the fire, echoing Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22-9.htm">Genesis 22:9</a>, who &#8220;arranged the wood&#8221; beneath Isaac, trusting God to provide the lamb. The orderly placement also highlights that God is not a God of chaos (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>), and true worship reflects His orderly nature.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cut up the bull</b><p>Elijah follows the Mosaic law&#8217;s exact procedure: &#8220;He is to skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/1-6.htm">Leviticus 1:6</a>). Cutting the bull underscores two truths:<p>&#8226; The costliness of sin&#8212;an innocent life is taken so the people may draw near to God (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The necessity of personal, hands-on obedience&#8212;Elijah himself performs the labor rather than delegating, much like Samuel who &#8220;hacked Agag to pieces&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>) when Saul refused full obedience. The vivid act anticipates the ultimate, once-for-all sacrifice of Christ, who was &#8220;pierced for our transgressions&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Placed it on the wood</b><p>Positioning the bull upon the wood readies it for the divine fire, paralleling how Isaac was laid on the wood in <a href="/genesis/22-9.htm">Genesis 22:9</a> and foreshadowing Christ being &#8220;lifted up&#8221; on the cross (<a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>). The laying of the sacrifice signifies substitution: the bull occupies the place the people deserved, just as Jesus bore our sins &#8220;in His body on the tree&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>). Elijah&#8217;s confidence that God would answer by fire (<a href="/1_kings/18-24.htm">1 Kings 18:24</a>) is so complete that he prepares everything before a single spark appears, demonstrating faith akin to the priests who stepped into the Jordan before it parted (<a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every deliberate movement in <a href="/1_kings/18-33.htm">1 Kings 18:33</a>&#8212;progressing in order, arranging the wood, dividing the bull, and setting it on the wood&#8212;highlights obedient faith and foreshadows the perfect sacrifice of Christ. Elijah&#8217;s careful adherence to God&#8217;s pattern invites us to worship with the same reverent precision, trusting the LORD to provide His consuming, sanctifying fire.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) F<span class= "bld">ill four barrels</span>--or pitchers. The filling of these at the time of drought has naturally excited speculation. A ready surmise, by those unacquainted with the country, was that the water was taken from the sea flowing at the base of Carmel; but a glance at the position and the height of the mountain puts this not unnatural surmise out of the question, as difficult, if not impossible. Examination of the locality has discovered a perennial spring in the neighbourhood of the traditional scene of the sacrifice, which is never known to fail in the severest drought. From this, no doubt (as indeed Josephus expressly says), the water was drawn, with, of course, the object of precluding all idea of fraud or contrivance, and bringing out strikingly the consuming fierceness of the fire from heaven, so emphatically described in <a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm" title="Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.">1Kings 18:38</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood</span> [Rawlinson says "He obeyed, that is, all the injunctions of the law with respect to the offering of a burnt sacrifice (see <a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>), and adds, "He thus publicly taught that all the ordinances of the law were binding on the kingdom of Israel." But it is very probable that the priests of Baal had done the same things. All sacrifice involved such manual acts. Cf. <a href="/genesis/22-9.htm">Genesis 22:9</a>, where the same word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> is used. No doubt the prophet did everything in an orderly and regular way; but the people could hardly learn a lesson of obedience from such elementary acts as these, and the less so as the law provided, that the sacrifice should be offered only "by the <span class="accented">priests</span>, the sons of Aaron" (<a href="/leviticus/1-8.htm">Leviticus 1:8</a>), and Elijah's ministrations, consequently, might seem to warrant or condone the ministrations of Jeroboam's intrusive priesthood. That they did not lend any <span class="accented">real</span> sanction to those irregularities is clear, however, to us. For, in the first place, priests were not to be had, all having long since left the kingdom. In the second place, the higher commission of the prophet embraced within itself the authority for all necessary priestly acts. Cf. <a href="/1_samuel/16-2.htm">1 Samuel 16:2</a>. Elijah acted, as Grotius well observes, <span class="accented">jure prophetico, minoribus legibus exsolutus, ut majores servaret</span>]<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and said, Fill four barrels</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>.

"In such springs the water remains always cool, under the shade of a vaulted roof, and with no hot atmosphere to evaporate it. While all other fountains were dried up, I can well understand that there might have been found here that superabundance of water which Elijah poured so profusely over the altar" (Van de Velde, 1. p. 325).] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/18-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Next, he arranged</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1430;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;r&#333;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
