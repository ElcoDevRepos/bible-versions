Its use in the temple signifies the importance and permanence of the structure. Cypress is mentioned in other parts of the Bible, such as <a href="/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a>, where it is associated with strength and beauty. The choice of cypress for the temple doors reflects the desire for a lasting and beautiful entrance to the sacred space. This wood's resilience can symbolize the enduring nature of God's covenant with His people.<p><b>and each had two folding panels</b><br>The design of the doors with folding panels suggests a practical and aesthetic function. Folding doors allowed for a grand entrance that could be opened wide for significant events or closed for privacy and security. This design is indicative of the advanced craftsmanship and architectural knowledge of the time. The folding panels may also symbolize the accessibility and openness of God's house, inviting worshippers to enter and commune with Him. The concept of doors opening wide can be seen in <a href="/psalms/24-7.htm">Psalm 24:7</a>, which speaks of gates lifting to welcome the King of Glory, a type of Christ entering His temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem, a task that his father, David, had desired to accomplish.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_in_jerusalem.htm">Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy place constructed by Solomon as a dwelling place for the Lord, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cypress_wood.htm">Cypress Wood</a></b><br>A durable and aromatic wood used in the construction of the temple doors, signifying strength and beauty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/doors_with_folding_panels.htm">Doors with Folding Panels</a></b><br>These doors were part of the temple's design, showcasing the craftsmanship and attention to detail in the temple's construction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_worship.htm">The Importance of Worship</a></b><br>The construction of the temple, including the detailed work on the doors, underscores the importance of creating a space dedicated to worship and reverence for God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/attention_to_detail_in_service_to_god.htm">Attention to Detail in Service to God</a></b><br>The craftsmanship involved in making the temple doors reflects the value of excellence and dedication in our service to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_doors.htm">Symbolism of the Doors</a></b><br>The doors serve as a metaphor for access to God, reminding us of the open invitation to enter into His presence through worship and prayer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_of_faithfulness.htm">Legacy of Faithfulness</a></b><br>Solomon's completion of the temple fulfills a promise made to David, illustrating the importance of faithfulness to God's plans across generations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_6_34_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 6:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_6_34_God_s_detail_in_worship.htm">How does 1 Kings 6:34 reflect God's attention to detail in worship spaces?
