The number six, often associated with human effort and imperfection, contrasts with the divine perfection symbolized by the number seven. This detail highlights the human aspect of Solomon's rule, despite his God-given wisdom. The steps also signify the elevated status of the king, both literally and figuratively, as he ascends to his seat of judgment and authority.<p><b>and its back had a rounded top</b><br>The rounded top of the throne's back may indicate a design that emphasizes completeness and unity, possibly reflecting the peace and prosperity of Solomon's reign. This design element could also suggest a connection to the divine, as circles often symbolize eternity and perfection in biblical literature. The throne's design, with its rounded top, may serve as a reminder of God's eternal covenant with David's line, fulfilled in part through Solomon and ultimately in Jesus Christ.<p><b>There were armrests on both sides of the seat</b><br>The presence of armrests on the throne signifies comfort and stability, suggesting the security and strength of Solomon's kingdom. Armrests may also symbolize the support and guidance provided by God to the king, ensuring his rule is just and wise. This detail reflects the importance of divine support in leadership, as seen throughout the Bible, where God upholds those He appoints to positions of authority.<p><b>with a lion standing beside each armrest</b><br>Lions are often symbols of strength, courage, and royalty in biblical and ancient Near Eastern cultures. The presence of lions beside the armrests underscores Solomon's power and authority as king. Lions are also associated with the tribe of Judah, from which Solomon descends, and they foreshadow the ultimate Lion of Judah, Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect kingship and authority. The imagery of lions reinforces the idea of divine protection and the fulfillment of God's promises to David's lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the construction of the temple and his own palace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/throne_of_solomon.htm">Throne of Solomon</a></b><br>A symbol of Solomon's authority and the grandeur of his reign, reflecting the prosperity and splendor of Israel during his time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lions.htm">Lions</a></b><br>Representations of strength and majesty, often associated with royalty and divine protection in ancient Near Eastern cultures.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where Solomon's throne was located, serving as the political and spiritual center of the nation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/q/queen_of_sheba.htm">Queen of Sheba</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, her visit to Solomon (earlier in the chapter) highlights the international recognition of Solomon's wisdom and wealth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbol_of_authority.htm">Symbol of Authority</a></b><br>The throne represents the authority given by God to Solomon.
