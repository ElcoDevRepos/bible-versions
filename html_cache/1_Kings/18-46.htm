In the Old Testament, the "hand of the LORD" often signifies God's power and presence enabling a person to perform extraordinary feats (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>). Elijah, a prophet, is empowered by God to accomplish His purposes, demonstrating that the true source of strength and ability comes from God. This empowerment is reminiscent of the Spirit of the Lord coming upon individuals like Samson (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>), highlighting the supernatural aspect of Elijah's actions.<p><b>and he tucked his cloak into his belt</b><br>This action signifies readiness and preparation for swift movement. In ancient times, long garments were common, and tucking them into a belt was necessary for running or working. This practical detail underscores Elijah's urgency and determination. It also symbolizes a readiness to serve God, similar to the New Testament exhortation to be prepared for action (<a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>).<p><b>and ran ahead of Ahab</b><br>Elijah's ability to outrun Ahab's chariot is a miraculous event, emphasizing the power of God working through him. Ahab, the king of Israel, would have had the best horses and chariots, yet Elijah surpasses them, illustrating the superiority of divine strength over human resources. This act can be seen as a demonstration of God's authority over the king and a sign of His favor upon Elijah.<p><b>all the way to Jezreel</b><br>Jezreel was a significant city in the northern kingdom of Israel, serving as a royal residence for Ahab and Jezebel. The distance from Mount Carmel to Jezreel is approximately 17 miles, making Elijah's run an impressive feat. Jezreel's location is strategic, situated in the fertile Jezreel Valley, which was a center of political and military activity. This journey signifies the transition from the victory on Mount Carmel to the impending confrontation with Jezebel, setting the stage for the ongoing conflict between the worship of Yahweh and Baal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who played a significant role in challenging the idolatry of Israel and demonstrating God's power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wickedness and for leading Israel into idolatry, particularly the worship of Baal.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezreel.htm">Jezreel</a></b><br>A city in the northern kingdom of Israel, significant as a royal city and a place of prophetic activity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hand_of_the_lord.htm">The Hand of the LORD</a></b><br>A phrase indicating divine empowerment or intervention, often seen in the context of God enabling His servants to accomplish extraordinary feats.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>Elijah, empowered by God, runs ahead of King Ahab's chariot to Jezreel, demonstrating God's power and the urgency of His message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_empowerment.htm">Divine Empowerment</a></b><br>God equips His servants with the strength and ability needed to fulfill His purposes.

At the head of the people he brings the king, conquered, if not repentant, home in triumph. To our conception of a prophet this frenzied excitement seems strange. Nor could it have belonged to a Samuel, an Elisha, or an Isaiah. In the simple and enthusiastic warrior of God it is natural enough.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah</span> [Same expression <a href="/2_kings/3-15.htm">2 Kings 3:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a>; cf. also <a href="/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>; <a href="/judges/2-15.htm">Judges 2:15</a>; <a href="/ruth/1-13.htm">Ruth 1:13</a>; <a href="/acts/11-21.htm">Acts 11:21</a>; <a href="/acts/13-11.htm">Acts 13:11</a>. Some of the commentators understand the words of Divine <span class="accented">guidance</span>, some of a supernatural strengthening. There is no need to exclude either interpretation. An impulse from on high impelled him to "gird up his loins" and go with the king; a strength not his own sustained him whilst "he ran," etc. The distance across the plain to Jezreel is about fourteen miles; the royal chariot would drive furiously, and whatever fleetness and endurance the prophet had acquired in the wilds of Gilead, it seems hardly likely that, after the fatigues and excitement of that day, he would have been able, without the hand of the Lord upon him, to keep ahead of the chariot horses], <span class="cmt_word">and he girded up his loins</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, gathered round his waist the <span class="accented">abba</span>, or "mantle" - the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> (cf. <a href="/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13, 19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-13.htm">2 Kings 2:13, 14</a>) was so-called from its ample size - which would otherwise have impeded his movements. Probably this, apart from the girdle, was his sole garment. (See Dict. Bib. vol. 2. p. 232)], <span class="cmt_word">and ran before Ahab</span> [Thomson (vol. 2. p. 227) mentions an interesting illustration of this incident which he witnessed. The forerunners of Mohammed All Pasha "kept just ahead of the horses, no matter how furiously they were ridden, and in order to run with the greatest ease they not only girded their loins very tightly, but also tucked up their loose garments under the girdle." But such a spectacle is of common occurrence in the East. Kitto remarks that the <span class="accented">Shatirs</span> of Persia keep pace with ease with their masters' horses. They also are tightly girded. His object was apparently twofold. First, to honour the sovereign whom he had that day humbled in the presence of his subjects. The great prophet, by assuming the lowly office of a <span class="accented">footman</span>, or forernnner (see note on 1 Kings 1:5), would give due reverence to the Lord's anointed, like Samuel on a somewhat similar occasion (<a href="/1_samuel/15-30.htm">1 Samuel 15:30, 31</a>). Secondly, he may have hoped by his presence near the king and court to strengthen any good resolves which the former might have made, and to further the work of reformation which he could not but hope the proceedings of that day would inaugurate. That this tribute of respect would be grateful to Ahab, who hitherto had only regarded Elijah as an adversary, it is impossible to doubt. And that Elijah believed he had struck a death blow to the foreign superstitions fostered by the court, and especially by the queen, is equally certain. It is not clear, as Bahr assumes, that his servant accompanied him on the road. He may have rejoined him later on in the day or night] <span class="cmt_word">to the entrance</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">until thou comest</span> to. The Arab aversion, which Elijah is supposed to have shared, to entering cities, has often been remarked. But there were other and deeper reasons why he should not adventure himself within the city. Probably the same guiding hand which led him to Jezreel impelled him to lodge outside the walls. It was impossible to say what Jezebel, in her transports of rage, might do. After such a day, too, any prophet would shrink from familiar contact with men and from the strife of tongues] <span class="cmt_word">of Jezreel.</span> [Ahab had a palace here (<a href="/1_kings/21-1.htm">1 Kings 21:1</a>). But Samaria was still the capital, and so remained till the captivity (<a href="/1_kings/22-37.htm">1 Kings 22:37</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-13.htm">2 Kings 15:13, 14</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5, 6</a>). The selection of Jezreel as a royal residence is easily accounted for. It stands on "a knoll 500 feet high" (Conder), overlooking both the plain of Esdraelon and the valley of Jezreel. In fact, it is the finest situation in the "Great Plain." Hence perhaps its name "the sowing place of God." See Stanley, S. and P. pp. 336 sqq.; Porter, p. 353; Dict.
