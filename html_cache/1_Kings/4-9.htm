This system of governance reflects Solomon's administrative organization and wisdom in managing the kingdom's resources. The name "Ben-deker" means "son of piercing" or "son of a lance," which may indicate a family known for its military prowess or leadership.<p><b>in Makaz</b><br>Makaz is a location mentioned only in this passage, and its exact location is uncertain. It is likely a town or district within the tribal allotments of Israel. The mention of Makaz highlights the extensive reach of Solomon's administration, ensuring that even lesser-known areas were included in the kingdom's governance.<p><b>in Shaalbim</b><br>Shaalbim is a town located in the territory of Dan, as mentioned in <a href="/joshua/19-42.htm">Joshua 19:42</a>. It was originally a Canaanite city, and its name means "place of foxes" or "place of jackals." The inclusion of Shaalbim in Solomon's administrative districts indicates the integration of various tribal territories into a unified kingdom.<p><b>in Beth-shemesh</b><br>Beth-shemesh, meaning "house of the sun," is a significant city located in the territory of Judah, near the border with Dan. It is known for its association with the return of the Ark of the Covenant by the Philistines in <a href="/1_samuel/6.htm">1 Samuel 6</a>. The city's inclusion in Solomon's district system underscores its importance as a religious and strategic location.<p><b>and in Elon-beth-hanan</b><br>Elon-beth-hanan is another location mentioned only in this passage, and its precise location is unknown. The name suggests a place associated with "Elon," meaning "oak" or "terebinth," and "beth-hanan," meaning "house of grace" or "house of favor." This may indicate a region known for its natural resources or a place of significance within the kingdom. The mention of Elon-beth-hanan reflects the comprehensive nature of Solomon's administrative reach, ensuring all areas contributed to the kingdom's prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-deker.htm">Ben-deker</a></b><br>One of King Solomon's twelve district governors, responsible for providing provisions for the king and his household for one month each year.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/makaz.htm">Makaz</a></b><br>A location within the territory assigned to Ben-deker.

One of the twelve officers Solomon appointed &#8220;to provide food for the king and his household; each man was to provide for one month of the year&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7, 27</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical insight: Solomon&#8217;s wisdom shows up not only in proverbs and judgments but in the administrative structure that kept an entire kingdom well supplied. Ben-deker&#8217;s job was real, measurable, and essential.<p>&#8226; Spiritual takeaway: God values order and delegation; He calls people to specific tasks (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-23</a>; <a href="/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3-4</a>).

Though Scripture mentions Makaz only here, its presence confirms the literal geographic spread of Solomon&#8217;s districts.<p>&#8226; Application: The Lord records places most people will never visit, reminding us that &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are everywhere&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>). No corner of His kingdom is unseen, and no work done there is forgotten (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in Shaalbim</b><p>&#8226; Cross-reference: Shaalbim (also called Shaalabbin) appears in <a href="/joshua/19-42.htm">Joshua 19:42</a> as territory allotted to Dan, and in <a href="/judges/1-35.htm">Judges 1:35</a> where the Amorites hemmed the Danites in.<p>&#8226; Lesson: Under Solomon the area once marked by conflict now contributes to national prosperity&#8212;evidence of God&#8217;s promise, &#8220;I will give you rest from all your enemies&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11</a>).
