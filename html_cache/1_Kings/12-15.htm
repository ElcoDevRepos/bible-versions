This decision highlights the importance of wise counsel and the consequences of pride and arrogance. The people's request for lighter burdens was reasonable, reflecting the heavy taxation and labor imposed by Solomon. Rehoboam's failure to heed their plea resulted in the loss of ten tribes, fulfilling the prophecy of division.<p><b>and indeed this turn of events was from the LORD</b><br>This indicates divine sovereignty and purpose behind the political and social upheaval. It underscores the biblical theme that God can use human decisions, even those made in error, to accomplish His divine will. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God uses both righteous and unrighteous actions to fulfill His plans, as seen in Joseph's story in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>.<p><b>to fulfill the word He had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat</b><br>This refers to the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah, where God promised Jeroboam ten tribes of Israel due to Solomon's idolatry and disobedience. It highlights the faithfulness of God in keeping His word and the inevitability of His prophetic declarations. Jeroboam's rise to power was not merely a political maneuver but a fulfillment of divine prophecy.<p><b>through Ahijah the Shilonite</b><br>Ahijah was a prophet from Shiloh, a significant religious center in Israel's history, known for housing the Ark of the Covenant before the temple was built in Jerusalem. His role as a prophet underscores the importance of prophetic voices in guiding and shaping Israel's history. The mention of Ahijah connects this event to earlier biblical narratives where prophets played crucial roles in communicating God's will, such as Samuel with Saul and David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, whose decision not to listen to the people's request led to the division of the kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The son of Nebat, who was promised by God through Ahijah the prophet that he would rule over ten tribes of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahijah_the_shilonite.htm">Ahijah the Shilonite</a></b><br>A prophet who delivered God's message to Jeroboam about the division of the kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who orchestrated the events to fulfill His word.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_division_of_the_kingdom.htm">The Division of the Kingdom</a></b><br>The event where Israel was divided into two kingdoms, Israel and Judah, as a result of Rehoboam's decision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_human_affairs.htm">God's Sovereignty in Human Affairs</a></b><br>Despite human decisions, God's purposes will ultimately prevail.

Proverbs reminds us that &#8220;the way of a fool is right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a>), and &#8220;with many counselors there is victory&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/24-6.htm">Proverbs 24:6</a>). By rejecting the people&#8217;s plea, Rehoboam echoes Pharaoh&#8217;s hardened stance (<a href="/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13</a>) and contrasts with David, who often sought godly advice (<a href="/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>; 1 Chron 14:10). His stubbornness opens the door for division because self-will blinds him to wisdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and indeed this turn of events was from the LORD</b><p>Even human folly is woven into God&#8217;s sovereign plan. The split kingdom was not a surprise or an accident; it was &#8220;from the LORD.&#8221; Similar wording appears when God directs outcomes that seem purely human (<a href="/judges/14-4.htm">Judges 14:4</a>; <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>). Scripture balances responsibility and sovereignty: Rehoboam is accountable for his pride, yet God directs history to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-11</a>). What looks like political chaos is actually divine choreography.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to fulfill the word He had spoken</b><p>God had already declared the division through His prophet (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11, 31</a>). He never drops a single promise (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>). Centuries later Jesus would say, &#8220;Scripture cannot be broken&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-35.htm">John 10:35</a>). The unfolding events remind us that God&#8217;s Word is not a suggestion but a settled decree, reliable for every generation (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite</b><p>Ahijah met Jeroboam on the road and dramatically tore a new cloak into twelve pieces, promising ten tribes to Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-39</a>). That prophecy now springs to life. God often speaks through unexpected messengers&#8212;Ahijah, a relatively unknown Shilonite, becomes the voice that shapes a nation&#8217;s future, much like Nathan confronting David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-7</a>) or Elijah challenging Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>). Jeroboam, though later notorious for idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/14-16.htm">1 Kings 14:16</a>), is still a chosen instrument at this moment, illustrating how the LORD raises up and removes leaders according to His timetable (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Rehoboam&#8217;s deaf ear to his people reveals human pride, yet the LORD turns that very arrogance into the means of keeping His Word. The verse underscores two unshakable truths: human choices carry real weight, and God&#8217;s sovereign plan stands unthwarted. When Scripture speaks, history bends to fulfill it, assuring believers that every promise of God will reach its appointed end.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">For the cause was from the Lord.</span>--The very idea of the Scriptural history, referring all things to God, necessarily brings us continually face to face with the great mystery of life--the reconcilement of God's all-foreseeing and all-ordaining Providence with the freedom, and, in consequence, with the folly and sin of man. As a rule, Holy Scripture--on this point confirming natural reason--simply recognises both powers as real, without any attempt, even by suggestion, to harmonise them together. It, of course, refers all to God's will, fulfilling or avenging itself in many ways, inspiring and guiding the good, and overruling the evil, in man. But it as invariably implies human freedom and responsibility. Rehoboam's folly and arrogance worked out the ordained judgment of God; but they were folly and arrogance still.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore the king hearkened not</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto the people, for the cause</span> [or course of events; lit., <span class="accented">turn</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>was from the Lord</span> ["<span class="accented">Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat</span>."
