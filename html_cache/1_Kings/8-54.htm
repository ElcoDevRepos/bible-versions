The prayer, found earlier in <a href="/1_kings/8.htm">1 Kings 8</a>, is a comprehensive petition for God's presence, forgiveness, and blessing upon Israel. It highlights Solomon's understanding of God's covenant with David and the importance of the Temple as a place of divine-human interaction. This moment marks the culmination of Solomon's dedication ceremony, emphasizing the importance of prayer in seeking God's favor and guidance.<p><b>he got up before the altar of the LORD</b><br>The altar of the LORD is central to Israelite worship, symbolizing God's presence and the place where sacrifices are offered. Solomon's position before the altar underscores his role as an intercessor for the people, bridging the gap between God and Israel. The altar's location in the Temple signifies the heart of Israel's religious life, where atonement and worship occur. This act of rising from prayer indicates a transition from supplication to action, as Solomon prepares to bless the assembly.<p><b>where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven</b><br>Kneeling with hands spread out is a posture of humility and supplication, reflecting a deep reverence for God. This physical expression of prayer is consistent with other biblical examples, such as Daniel (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>) and Ezra (<a href="/ezra/9-5.htm">Ezra 9:5</a>), who also prayed with uplifted hands. It symbolizes openness to receive God's blessings and an acknowledgment of His sovereignty. The gesture of spreading hands toward heaven signifies a direct appeal to God, recognizing His authority and the need for divine intervention. Solomon's posture is a model of earnest prayer, demonstrating the proper attitude of worship and dependence on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, son of David, known for his wisdom and for building the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_of_the_lord.htm">The Altar of the LORD</a></b><br>A sacred place in the temple where sacrifices and prayers were offered to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy place constructed by Solomon as a dwelling place for the presence of God among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_and_petition.htm">Prayer and Petition</a></b><br>Solomon's prayer of dedication for the temple, seeking God's presence and blessing upon Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/kneeling_with_hands_spread_toward_heaven.htm">Kneeling with Hands Spread Toward Heaven</a></b><br>A posture of humility and supplication, indicating reverence and earnestness in prayer.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_reverent_prayer.htm">The Importance of Reverent Prayer</a></b><br>Solomon's posture of kneeling with hands spread toward heaven demonstrates a deep reverence for God.

That prayer:<p>&#8226; Magnified God&#8217;s faithfulness to David (v. 24; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Asked for God&#8217;s attentive &#8220;eyes&#8221; and &#8220;ears&#8221; toward His people&#8217;s future cries (v. 29; cf. <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Anticipated sin, exile, and restoration, showing confidence that repentance moves God to forgive (vv. 46-50; cf. <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>- &#8220;Finished&#8221; signals completion and trust. Like Hannah after her prayer (<a href="/1_samuel/1-18.htm">1 Samuel 1:18</a>) or Jesus declaring &#8220;It is finished&#8221; (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), Solomon leaves the request with God, sure He hears (<a href="/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14-15</a>).<p>- The word &#8220;entire&#8221; reminds us that God welcomes detailed, thoughtful petitions (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>), not hurried or half-hearted requests.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He got up before the altar of the LORD</b><p>- Solomon rises in the very place sacrifices were offered (<a href="/exodus/40-6.htm">Exodus 40:6</a>). The altar pictures atonement and fellowship with God (<a href="/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p>- Standing up shows readiness to act on what was prayed. Elijah did the same at another altar when fire fell (<a href="/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30-39</a>). Faith that prays is faith that then obeys (<a href="/james/2-18.htm">James 2:18</a>).<p>- His position &#8220;before the altar&#8221; also highlights public leadership. Like Joshua who &#8220;stood before the ark of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27-28</a>), Solomon models worship for the nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Where he had been kneeling</b><p>- <a href="/2_chronicles/6-13.htm">2 Chronicles 6:13</a> fills in the scene: Solomon knelt on a bronze platform in the court.<p>- Kneeling expresses humility and surrender (<a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a>; <a href="/luke/22-41.htm">Luke 22:41</a>). Even a king bows to the true King.<p>- In Scripture kneeling often accompanies decisive intercession&#8212;<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>, <a href="/ezra/9-5.htm">Ezra 9:5</a>, <a href="/acts/20-36.htm">Acts 20:36</a>. Solomon joins that line of servants who admit dependence on God alone.<p>- For us, posture is not a ritual requirement, yet physical humility can stir inward reverence (<a href="/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With his hands spread out toward heaven</b><p>- The gesture began back in <a href="/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22</a> when the prayer started; he keeps the same posture to the end. Raised, open hands picture:<p>&#8226; Appeal&#8212;reaching upward for help (<a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Surrender&#8212;nothing hidden, everything offered (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Blessing&#8212;speaking God&#8217;s favor over the people (<a href="/leviticus/9-22.htm">Leviticus 9:22</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-27.htm">2 Chronicles 30:27</a>).<p>- The New Testament echoes the posture for believers: &#8220;I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>).<p>- Heavenward hands remind us that answers come from above, not from human strength (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/8-54.htm">1 Kings 8:54</a> captures the moment after Solomon&#8217;s great dedication prayer. He completes a thorough, faith-filled petition, rises before the atoning altar, embodies humility by having knelt, and keeps his hands lifted toward heaven in dependence and praise. The verse teaches that effective prayer is wholehearted, reverent, confident in God&#8217;s hearing, and expressed in a life ready to act on what has been entrusted to the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(54) <span class= "bld">And it was so.</span>--At this point occurs in <a href="/context/2_chronicles/7-1.htm" title="Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.">2Chronicles 7:1-3</a> a striking passage, describing the kindling of the sacrifice by fire from heaven, and, apparently, a second manifestation of the cloud of glory.
