This aligns with the laws given in <a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-42</a>, where Israelites were not to be treated as slaves but as hired workers. Solomon's reign is marked by prosperity and peace, allowing him to respect these laws. This decision also highlights the distinction between Israelites and the foreign laborers Solomon used for his building projects, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20-21</a>.<p><b>because they were his men of war</b><br>The Israelites served as soldiers, a role of honor and responsibility. This military service was crucial for maintaining the security and stability of the kingdom. The reference to "men of war" connects to the earlier establishment of a standing army under King David, Solomon's father, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/27.htm">1 Chronicles 27</a>. This military organization was essential for defending Israel's borders and ensuring peace during Solomon's reign.<p><b>his servants</b><br>These servants were likely involved in the administration and governance of the kingdom. Solomon's wisdom, as granted by God (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>), enabled him to organize a complex bureaucracy. This administrative structure is further detailed in <a href="/1_kings/4.htm">1 Kings 4</a>, where various officials are listed. The role of these servants was to support the king in managing the affairs of the state, ensuring efficient governance.<p><b>his officers</b><br>The officers were responsible for overseeing various aspects of the kingdom's operations. They likely included military leaders and those in charge of specific regions or tasks. This reflects the organized and hierarchical nature of Solomon's administration, which was necessary for managing the extensive and prosperous kingdom. The officers played a crucial role in implementing the king's policies and maintaining order.<p><b>his captains</b><br>Captains were military leaders responsible for smaller units within the army. Their role was vital for maintaining discipline and effectiveness in military operations. This structure of leadership within the army ensured that Solomon's forces were well-organized and capable of defending the kingdom. The use of captains is consistent with the military practices of the time, as seen in other ancient Near Eastern cultures.<p><b>and the commanders of his chariots and cavalry</b><br>Chariots and cavalry were significant components of ancient military forces, providing mobility and strength in battle. Solomon's investment in chariots and cavalry, as mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>, demonstrates his commitment to maintaining a powerful and modern military. This military capability was a deterrent against potential aggressors and contributed to the peace and stability of Solomon's reign. The commanders of these units were skilled leaders, ensuring the effective use of these resources in defense of the kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, who were God's chosen people and the primary subjects of Solomon's kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/soldiers_and_officials.htm">Soldiers and Officials</a></b><br>These were the Israelites who served in various capacities in Solomon's administration, including military and governmental roles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/commanders_and_captains.htm">Commanders and Captains</a></b><br>These were leaders within Solomon's military structure, responsible for overseeing the army and chariots.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/chariots_and_cavalry.htm">Chariots and Cavalry</a></b><br>Part of Solomon's military might, these units were crucial for defense and warfare during his reign.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_responsibility.htm">Leadership and Responsibility</a></b><br>Solomon's decision not to enslave the Israelites but to employ them in positions of responsibility reflects a leadership style that values and empowers his people.

They are here described as occupying the position of a dominant race--as warriors, servants about the person of the king, princes, and officers in the array--like the free vassals under a feudal monarchy. But as the absolute power of the king increased, and with it, perhaps, the wealth and arrogance of his favourites and greater officers, the condition of the Israelites at large might be removed from serfship more in name than in reality. Even the subject races might be played of against them, as against the Macedonians in the later years of Alexander the Great, when his royalty passed into something like a true Oriental despotism. Certainly, in later times we find, both from the history and the prophetical books, that there was such a thing as serf ship of the poor to the princes.
