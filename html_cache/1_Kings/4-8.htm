Naming individuals in biblical texts often signifies their importance and role in the narrative. In ancient Israel, names held significant meaning and often reflected the character or destiny of the person. The listing of names here underscores the organized and structured administration under Solomon's reign, reflecting the wisdom and order he brought to the kingdom.<p><b>Ben-hur in the hill country of Ephraim;</b><br>Ben-hur, meaning "son of Hur," is one of the twelve officials appointed by Solomon. The name "Hur" is associated with nobility and leadership, as seen in other biblical references (e.g., <a href="/exodus/17-10.htm">Exodus 17:10</a>). The hill country of Ephraim refers to a central region in Israel, known for its rugged terrain and strategic importance. Ephraim was one of the prominent tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son Ephraim, and often symbolized strength and leadership (<a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>). This area was significant in Israel's history, serving as a backdrop for various biblical events. The appointment of Ben-hur in this region highlights the need for strong governance in a key area of the kingdom. The mention of Ephraim also connects to prophecies and blessings given to the tribe, emphasizing its continued importance in Israel's narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hur.htm">Ben-hur</a></b><br>One of the twelve officials appointed by King Solomon to provide provisions for the king and his household.
