These pillars were not only structural but also symbolic, representing strength and stability. In ancient Near Eastern architecture, such capitals were often elaborate, signifying the importance and grandeur of the building. The use of pillars in temple construction can be seen in other ancient cultures, but in the context of the Temple, they also symbolize God's enduring presence and support for His people.<p><b>he made a network of lattice</b><br>The network of lattice refers to the intricate design work that adorned the capitals. This type of decoration was common in ancient craftsmanship, showcasing the skill and artistry of the workers. The latticework could symbolize the interconnectedness of God's creation or the complexity and beauty of divine wisdom. In a spiritual sense, it may also represent the interwoven nature of God's covenant with Israel, binding them together as a community.<p><b>with wreaths of chainwork</b><br>The wreaths of chainwork further enhanced the decorative aspect of the capitals. Chains in biblical symbolism often represent binding or connection. Here, they could signify the binding nature of God's promises or the unity of the people under His covenant. The use of wreaths, which are circular, might also symbolize eternity and the everlasting nature of God's kingdom.<p><b>seven for each capital</b><br>The number seven is significant in biblical literature, often representing completeness or perfection. In the context of the Temple, the use of seven wreaths for each capital could symbolize the perfection and completeness of God's plan and His creation. This number is frequently seen throughout Scripture, such as in the seven days of creation, the sevenfold Spirit of God, and the seven churches in Revelation, all pointing to divine completeness and fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple and his palace.

These capitals were not optional decorations; they were integral to the design God inspired through David and executed by Solomon (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; Capitals lift the eye upward, reminding worshipers that the LORD Himself is above all (<a href="/psalms/113-4.htm">Psalm 113:4</a>). Just as the sanctuary furnishings of Exodus were &#8220;exactly according to the pattern&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>), these pillars&#8212;and everything atop them&#8212;were built literally and precisely.<p>&#8226; Cross references: <a href="/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15&#8211;17</a> parallels the construction; <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a> pictures believers made pillars in God&#8217;s temple, echoing the permanence symbolized here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he made a network of lattice</b><p>&#8226; Hiram, the master craftsman (<a href="/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13&#8211;14</a>), formed a delicate, crisscross design encircling each capital. The lattice allowed light and air to pass through, hinting at openness before God while still providing structure&#8212;much like the veil later torn in Christ (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, the lattice strengthened the capitals, yet spiritually it illustrated divine order: beauty married to stability (<a href="/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross references: <a href="/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a> describes the tabernacle&#8217;s artistry; <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a> calls believers &#8220;living stones,&#8221; arranged into a spiritual house with similar orderly beauty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with wreaths of chainwork</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;wreaths&#8221; were ornamental chains, woven around the lattice like garlands. Such chainwork mirrored the gold chains before the Most Holy Place in the tabernacle (<a href="/1_kings/6-21.htm">1 Kings 6:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Chains often signify unity and bonding; here they bind the design together and point to covenant loyalty&#8212;the LORD&#8217;s unbreakable commitment to His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross references: <a href="/exodus/28-14.htm">Exodus 28:14</a> shows chains on the high-priestly breastpiece; <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a> notes that a cord of three strands is not quickly broken, emphasizing strength in unity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>seven for each capital</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Seven&#8221; is consistently the biblical number of completeness (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-15.htm">Joshua 6:15</a>). By providing seven wreaths for each capital, God stamped the pillars with a sign of wholeness and divine perfection.<p>&#8226; Two pillars &#215; seven wreaths each = fourteen; that double measure of completeness flanked the temple entrance, proclaiming that anyone who came to worship was coming into a place established and perfected by the LORD (<a href="/psalms/93-5.htm">Psalm 93:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross references: <a href="/leviticus/4-6.htm">Leviticus 4:6</a> applies blood seven times for full atonement; <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a> depicts the Lamb with seven horns and seven eyes, expressing total authority and knowledge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/7-17.htm">1 Kings 7:17</a> records more than artistic detail; it reveals God&#8217;s insistence on literal, perfect craftsmanship that reflects His own character.

"This decoration consisted of seven twists arranged as festoons, which were hung round the capitals of the pillars" (Keil). The comparison with "chain work" was probably suggestd by the fact that the intertwined threads, which crossed and recrossed each other, bore a rough resemblance to the links of a chain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/7-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For the capitals</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1514;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1428;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(lak&#183;k&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
