The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was the central place of worship for the Israelites. Jerusalem, located in the southern kingdom of Judah, was the spiritual and political center established by King David and solidified by Solomon through the construction of the temple. Jeroboam feared that continued religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem would undermine his authority and loyalty to his rule. This concern highlights the centrality of the temple in Jewish worship and the importance of Jerusalem as a unifying religious site. The division of the kingdom created a tension between political and religious loyalties.<p><b>their hearts will return to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah</b><br>Jeroboam's fear was that the people's allegiance would shift back to Rehoboam, Solomon's son, who ruled over Judah. The "hearts" here symbolize loyalty and devotion, indicating that religious practices were deeply intertwined with political allegiance. Rehoboam's rule over Judah included the city of Jerusalem, the spiritual heart of the nation. This phrase underscores the potential for religious practices to influence political dynamics, as the temple in Jerusalem was not only a place of worship but also a symbol of the Davidic dynasty's legitimacy and God's covenant with David.<p><b>then they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.</b><br>Jeroboam's fear of being killed reflects the political instability and the threat of rebellion he perceived. His concern was that the people's renewed loyalty to Rehoboam would lead to his own downfall. This fear led Jeroboam to establish alternative worship centers in Bethel and Dan, introducing golden calves as objects of worship to prevent the Israelites from going to Jerusalem. This act was a direct violation of the first and second commandments and set a precedent for idolatry in the northern kingdom. Jeroboam's actions can be seen as a turning point that led Israel away from the worship of Yahweh, contributing to the eventual downfall of the northern kingdom. This phrase highlights the tension between political power and religious faithfulness, a recurring theme in the history of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

Trust God&#8217;s promises, honor His appointed place of worship, and refuse to let anxiety rewrite obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27, 28) In these verses is recorded the adoption of the fatal policy which has caused Jeroboam to be handed down in the sacred record as "the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin." Hitherto his new royalty had been inaugurated under a Divine sanction, both as receiving distinct promise of permanence and blessing (<a href="/context/1_kings/11-37.htm" title="And I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.">1Kings 11:37-38</a>), and as protected by open prophetic interference, at the critical moment when its ill-consolidated force might have been crushed. Nor is it unlikely that it may have been supported by a wholesome reaction against the idolatry, as well as against the despotism, of Solomon. Now, unsatisfied with these securities of his kingdom, and desirous to strengthen it by a bold stroke of policy, he takes the step which mars the bright promise of his accession. Yet the policy was exceedingly natural. In Israel, beyond all other nations, civil and religious allegiance were indissolubly united; it was almost impossible to see how separate national existence could have been sustained without the creation, or (as it might seem) the revival, of local sanctuaries to rival the sacredness of Jerusalem. Nor was the breach of Divine law apparently a serious one. The worship at Dan and Bethel was not the bloody and sensual worship of false gods, but the worship of the Lord Jehovah under the form of a visible emblem, meant to be a substitute for the ark and the overshadowing cherubim. It might have been plausibly urged that, to wean Israel from all temptation to the abominations which Solomon had introduced, it was necessary to give their faith the visible support of these great local sanctuaries, and the lesser "high places" which would naturally follow. But the occasion was the critical moment of choice between a worldly policy--"doing evil that good might come"--and the higher and more arduous path of simple faith in God's promise, and obedience to the command designed to protect the purity and spirituality of His worship. The step, once taken, was never retraced. Eminently successful in its immediate object of making the separation irreparable, it purchased success at the price, first, of destruction of all religious unity in Israel, and next, of a natural corruption, opening the door at once to idolatry, and hereafter to the grosser apostasy, against which it professed to guard. It needed the faith of David--as shown, for example, in the patient acquiescence in the prohibition of the erection of a Temple to be the spiritual glory of his kingdom--to secure the promise of "a sure house, as for David."
