These marriages were likely intended to establish alliances with surrounding nations, such as Egypt and Moab. This practice, while politically advantageous, was contrary to <a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>, which warned Israelite kings against taking many wives, as it could lead their hearts astray. Solomon's actions reflect a departure from the covenantal ideals set for Israel's leaders.<p><b>and three hundred concubines</b><br>Concubines in ancient Israel were women who had a recognized relationship with a man but without the full status of a wife. They often bore children and were part of the household. The large number of concubines indicates Solomon's immense wealth and power, as maintaining such a household required significant resources. This practice, however, also reflects a deviation from the monogamous ideal seen in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> and highlights the potential for moral and spiritual compromise.<p><b>and his wives turned his heart away</b><br>This phrase underscores the spiritual danger of Solomon's marriages. Despite his wisdom, Solomon's heart was led astray by his foreign wives, who worshipped other gods. This turning away is a fulfillment of the warning in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>, which cautioned against intermarriage with foreign nations to prevent the Israelites from being led into idolatry. Solomon's apostasy had significant consequences, leading to the division of the kingdom after his death, as prophesied in <a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>.

The alliances looked wise but proved fatal to faith, turning the wisest king&#8217;s heart away from the LORD. The verse stands as a sober reminder that obedience safeguards devotion, and that even subtle compromises in relationships can steer a heart off course.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines.</span>--The harem of an Eastern king is simply an adjunct of his magnificence, and the relation of the wives to him little more than nominal. (Comp. <a href="/esther/2-14.htm" title="In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in to the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.">Esther 2:14</a>.) Nor does the statement here made necessarily imply that at any one time the whole number existed. Still, the numbers here given, though found also in the LXX. and in Josephus, are not only extraordinarily large, but excessive in comparison with the "three- score queens and fourscore concubines" of <a href="/songs/6-8.htm" title="There are three score queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.">Song of Solomon 6:8</a>, and disproportionate in the relative number of the superior and inferior wives. It is possible that, in relation to the former, at any rate, the text may be corrupt, though the corruption must be of ancient date.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he had seven hundred wives, princesses</span> [These may have been members of royal or princely houses of neighbouring nations. Evidently they enjoyed a distinguished rank], <span class="cmt_word">and three hundred concubines</span> [Though not committed to a defence of the accuracy of the figures 700 and 300 (which are clearly <span class="accented">round</span> numbers), it must be said that the reasons alleged for reducing them (as from 700 to 70) are not of much weight. It is hardly correct, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, to say (as Rawlinson) that the numbers are given in <a href="/songs/6-8.htm">Song of Solomon 6:8</a> as "threescore queens and fourscore concubines," for it is obvious that too much importance must not be attached to an <span class="accented">obiter</span> statement ("there are threescore," etc.) in a poetical book, too, and one descriptive of Solomon's youth. The view of Ewald and Keil, again, that these numbers represent the sum total of the inmates of the harem at different periods of Solomon's long reign, rather than the number present at any one time - they would see in the numbers of Song of Solomon <span class="accented">l.c</span>. a statement of the <span class="accented">average strength</span> of the seraglio - though not to be described as evasive, is certainly not the natural interpretation of the words. And these numbers, when we compare them with the establishments of other Eastern potentates, are not found to be at all incredible. The commentators all remind us that Dareius Codomannus, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, took with him on his expedition against Alexander 360 <span class="accented">pellices</span>. Or if ancient history, as Rawlinson affirms, furnishes no strict parallel to these figures, the harems of modern Persia and Turkey at any rate have quite equalled that of Solomon. (See Bahr <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) It is true that Rehoboam had only 18 wives and 60 concubines (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>), but then Rehoboam was not Solomon. If his harem was but a tithe of his father's, so also were his wealth and his power]: <span class="cmt_word">and his wives turned away his heart.</span> ["Satan hath found this bait to take so well that he never changed since he crept into Paradise" (Bp.
