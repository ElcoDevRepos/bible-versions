The "house of the LORD" is the temple Solomon built, a central place of worship for Israel, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The "royal palace" refers to the king's residence, which was also constructed by Solomon. The seizing of treasures indicates a significant loss of wealth and divine favor, as these treasures were not only material wealth but also held religious significance. This event fulfills the prophecy given to Solomon that if Israel turned away from God, they would face consequences (<a href="/1_kings/9-6.htm">1 Kings 9:6-9</a>). The loss of these treasures symbolizes the spiritual decline of the nation under Rehoboam's leadership.<p><b>He took everything,</b><br>The phrase "He took everything" emphasizes the totality of the plunder. This was not a partial loss but a complete stripping of the wealth that had been accumulated during Solomon's prosperous reign. It highlights the vulnerability of Judah when they turned away from God's commandments. This act of taking everything can be seen as a divine judgment, as the wealth that was meant to honor God was now in the hands of a foreign power. This serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the fleeting nature of earthly riches.<p><b>including all the gold shields that Solomon had made.</b><br>The gold shields were part of Solomon's extensive building projects and symbolized the kingdom's wealth and strength. They were used in ceremonial processions and displayed in the House of the Forest of Lebanon (<a href="/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16-17</a>). The loss of these shields represents not only a material loss but also a loss of national pride and security. The shields, made of gold, were a testament to Solomon's wisdom and God's blessing during his reign. Their capture by Shishak signifies the end of an era of prosperity and the beginning of a period of decline. This event foreshadows the eventual downfall of both the northern and southern kingdoms due to their continued disobedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shishak,_king_of_egypt.htm">Shishak, King of Egypt</a></b><br>The Pharaoh who invaded Jerusalem during the reign of Rehoboam, taking away the treasures of the temple and the royal palace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, whose reign saw the division of the united kingdom and the subsequent invasion by Shishak.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, where the temple and the royal palace were located, and which was plundered by Shishak.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites, built by Solomon.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_royal_palace.htm">The Royal Palace</a></b><br>The residence of the king, which housed significant wealth and treasures.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Rehoboam's failure to follow God's commandments led to the loss of divine protection and the plundering of Jerusalem.

Their loss signals the withdrawal of divine protection that had guarded these sacred assets during Solomon&#8217;s faithful years (<a href="/1_kings/9-3.htm">1 Kings 9:3&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; By permitting the temple&#8217;s wealth to be carried off, the Lord underscores that external riches cannot compensate for internal rebellion&#8212;a recurring theme also visible when Philistines captured the ark in Samuel&#8217;s day (<a href="/1_samuel/4-10.htm">1 Samuel 4:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and of the royal palace</b><p>&#8226; Shishak did not stop at the sanctuary; he stripped the king&#8217;s own treasuries as well (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-9.htm">2 Chronicles 12:9</a>). Royal and sacred fortunes fall together because the covenant linked throne and temple (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-3.htm">1 Kings 2:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Rehoboam&#8217;s luxurious inheritance from Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21&#8211;23</a>) evaporates within five short years, reminding rulers that prosperity rests on continued obedience, not past achievements (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10&#8211;14, 19</a>).<p>&#8226; The breach between Judah and ten&#8208;tribe Israel had already weakened the kingdom politically (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>). Now economic loss follows spiritual decline, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a> &#8213; &#8220;The blessing of the LORD enriches, and He adds no sorrow to it,&#8221; but its withdrawal brings sorrow indeed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He took everything</b><p>&#8226; The statement stresses totality. Judah keeps nothing of what had been stockpiled over decades. God&#8217;s word, delivered through Shemaiah, had warned that Shishak would carry away their &#8220;servants&#8221; and &#8220;treasures&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; This completeness mirrors prior covenant warnings: if Israel turned aside, enemies would &#8220;consume the land&#8217;s produce&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>) and leave the nation impoverished (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-47.htm">Deuteronomy 28:47&#8211;48</a>).<p>&#8226; The plundering foreshadows the later Babylonian exile, where temple articles are again removed (<a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>), teaching that partial repentance brings only partial relief; without wholehearted turning, judgment continues.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>including all the gold shields that Solomon had made</b><p>&#8226; Solomon had fashioned 200 large and 300 smaller shields of pure gold for ceremonial display in the &#8220;House of the Forest of Lebanon&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16&#8211;17</a>). They symbolized national glory, security, and divine favor.<p>&#8226; Their seizure is especially poignant: what once represented strength is paraded by an enemy. Rehoboam&#8217;s later replacement with bronze shields (<a href="/1_kings/14-27.htm">1 Kings 14:27</a>) showcases a downgrade&#8212;from untarnished gold to inferior metal&#8212;portraying diminished splendor.<p>&#8226; Isaiah would later speak of a similar exchange: &#8220;Instead of bronze I will bring gold&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/60-17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>). Here, Judah experiences the reverse, emphasizing that sin reverses blessings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a> records God&#8217;s tangible judgment upon Judah&#8217;s early apostasy. By allowing Shishak to remove temple and palace wealth&#8212;culminating in the loss of Solomon&#8217;s prized gold shields&#8212;the Lord demonstrates that covenant disobedience strips a nation of both spiritual protection and material prosperity. The verse serves as a sober reminder that every treasure, no matter how firmly stored, remains secure only under God&#8217;s continued favor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">He even took away all.</span>--There is a touch of pathos in the description of the utter spoil of the treasures in which Solomon and Israel had gloried, and which now served only to buy off the victorious Egyptians. There is no notice of any sack of Jerusalem, nor, as in later cases, of any desecration of the Temple, or even of the plunder of its decorations. The record seems to imply surrender of the city and its treasures. The idea sometimes advanced, that, like the capture of Rome by the Gauls, the invasion of Shishak destroyed all ancient monuments and archives, has therefore no historical support from this passage; and with it many conclusions derived from it as to the dates of our Scriptural records must pass away.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord</span> [The historian omits to mention the interposition of Shemaiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5-8</a>).
