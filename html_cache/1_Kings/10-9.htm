It reflects the recognition of God's hand in the affairs of Israel, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. The blessing of the LORD is a common expression of praise and gratitude, seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/29-10.htm">1 Chronicles 29:10</a>.<p><b>who has delighted in you</b><br>The delight of God in Solomon signifies divine favor and approval. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24-25</a>, where Solomon is called "Jedidiah," meaning "beloved of the LORD." It underscores the special relationship between God and Solomon, highlighting the king's role in fulfilling God's purposes.<p><b>to set you on the throne of Israel</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine appointment of Solomon as king. The throne of Israel is not merely a political seat but a symbol of God's covenant with David, as promised in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>. Solomon's reign is seen as a continuation of this covenant, with the throne representing God's enduring promise to David's lineage.<p><b>Because of the LORD&#8217;s eternal love for Israel</b><br>God's eternal love for Israel is a central theme in the Bible, reflecting His covenantal faithfulness. This love is unconditional and everlasting, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>. It underscores the idea that Israel's election and preservation are rooted in God's steadfast love.<p><b>He has made you king</b><br>The making of Solomon as king is attributed to God's sovereign will. This divine appointment is a fulfillment of God's promise to David and is indicative of God's control over the leadership of His people. It also points to the idea that true authority comes from God, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>.<p><b>to carry out justice and righteousness</b><br>Justice and righteousness are foundational principles of God's kingdom, as seen in <a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>. Solomon's role as king is to embody these principles, reflecting God's character and ensuring the well-being of the nation. This mirrors the messianic expectation of a ruler who will reign with justice and righteousness, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> and fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/q/queen_of_sheba.htm">Queen of Sheba</a></b><br>A monarch from a wealthy kingdom, likely in the region of modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia, who visits King Solomon to test his wisdom and witness his wealth and splendor.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is renowned for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.
