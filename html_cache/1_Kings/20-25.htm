In the context of <a href="/1_kings/20.htm">1 Kings 20</a>, the Arameans, led by King Ben-Hadad, had suffered a significant defeat at the hands of the Israelites. The call to raise an army "like the one you have lost" indicates a strategy to match the previous military strength, suggesting a reliance on human power and resources rather than seeking divine guidance. This reflects a common theme in the Old Testament where reliance on military might is often contrasted with reliance on God (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><b>horse for horse and chariot for chariot&#8212;</b><br>Horses and chariots were symbols of military power and technological advancement in ancient Near Eastern warfare. The emphasis on matching the number of horses and chariots highlights the importance of these assets in battle. In biblical times, chariots were a significant advantage in warfare, especially on flat terrain. This phrase underscores the Arameans' belief in the superiority of their military technology. The Bible often warns against placing trust in chariots and horses instead of God (<a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p><b>so we can fight the Israelites on the plain,</b><br>The Arameans believed that their previous defeat was due to the mountainous terrain, which favored the Israelites. By choosing to fight on the plain, they hoped to leverage their chariots' effectiveness. This reflects a common ancient belief that gods were territorial, and the Arameans thought they could defeat Israel's God by changing the battlefield. This underestimates the omnipotence of the God of Israel, who is not limited by geography (<a href="/1_kings/20-28.htm">1 Kings 20:28</a>).<p><b>where we will surely prevail.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reveals the Arameans' confidence in their revised strategy. It also highlights a recurring biblical theme of human arrogance and the presumption of victory based on worldly wisdom and strength. The belief that they would "surely prevail" demonstrates a lack of understanding of God's sovereignty and power, which is a central lesson in the narrative of <a href="/1_kings/20.htm">1 Kings 20</a>.<p><b>And the king approved their plan and acted accordingly.</b><br>King Ben-Hadad's approval of the plan shows his agreement with the advisors' assessment and his willingness to rely on human strategy rather than seeking divine counsel. This decision sets the stage for the subsequent events where God's power is demonstrated despite human plans. The king's actions reflect a broader biblical narrative where leaders often face the consequences of ignoring God's will (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-Hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) who seeks to rebuild his army after a defeat by the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, led by King Ahab during this period, who are the opponents of Ben-Hadad.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plains.htm">The Plains</a></b><br>The geographical setting where Ben-Hadad believes he can defeat the Israelites, contrasting with the hills where he previously lost.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/advisors_of_ben-hadad.htm">Advisors of Ben-Hadad</a></b><br>They counsel him to fight the Israelites on the plains, believing that the gods of Israel are gods of the hills.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahab.htm">King Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel at the time, who is involved in the conflict with Ben-Hadad.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reliance_on_human_wisdom.htm">Reliance on Human Wisdom</a></b><br>Ben-Hadad's decision to follow his advisors' counsel without seeking divine guidance highlights the danger of relying solely on human wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/misunderstanding_god's_power.htm">Misunderstanding God's Power</a></b><br>The Arameans' belief that God is limited to certain geographical areas reflects a misunderstanding of God's omnipotence and sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/strategic_planning_vs._divine_will.htm">Strategic Planning vs. Divine Will</a></b><br>While strategic planning is important, it should not replace seeking God's will and guidance in our decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_folly_of_repeating_mistakes.htm">The Folly of Repeating Mistakes</a></b><br>Ben-Hadad's attempt to rebuild his army in the same manner as before shows the folly of repeating past mistakes without learning from them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_all_circumstances.htm">God's Sovereignty in All Circumstances</a></b><br>This passage reminds us that God is sovereign over all creation, and His power is not confined to specific locations or situations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_20_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 20:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_20_25_God_s_control_in_battle.htm">How does 1 Kings 20:25 demonstrate God's sovereignty over military strategies and outcomes?

Their counsel reflects confidence that numbers matter. Scripture repeatedly shows kings rebuilding after loss&#8212;Rehoboam mustered Judah after Shishak&#8217;s raid (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5-12</a>), and Asa rebuilt fortified cities when threatened (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-6.htm">2 Chronicles 14:6-8</a>). Yet the earlier rout proved that human strength cannot overturn God&#8217;s decree (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>); without the LORD, fresh troops cannot guarantee success.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>horse for horse and chariot for chariot</b><p>Horses and chariots were the ancient equivalent of tanks&#8212;symbols of power and speed (<a href="/exodus/14-9.htm">Exodus 14:9</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>). Matching Israel unit for unit sounds prudent, but Israel&#8217;s God had already shown supremacy over such forces, drowning Pharaoh&#8217;s chariots (<a href="/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>) and later striking the Syrians with blindness when they surrounded Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/6-14.htm">2 Kings 6:14-18</a>). The verse exposes reliance on visible might rather than on the unseen Sovereign (2 <a href="/colossians/4-18.htm">Colossians 4:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>fight the Israelites on the plain</b><p>The Arameans assume Israel&#8217;s victory came only because the battle occurred in the hills around Samaria (<a href="/1_kings/20-23.htm">1 Kings 20:23</a>). By shifting to the flatlands of Aphek (v. 26), they believe Israel&#8217;s supposed &#8220;mountain god&#8221; will be powerless. This echoes earlier pagan thinking&#8212;Philistines moved the ark city to city (<a href="/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8-10</a>), thinking Yahweh&#8217;s reach was limited. God will shortly declare, &#8220;I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/20-28.htm">1 Kings 20:28</a>), proving He reigns over every terrain (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we will surely prevail</b><p>Their confidence rests on:<p>&#8226; Numerical parity (&#8220;like the one you lost&#8221;)<p>&#8226; Superior technology (horses, chariots)<p>&#8226; Tactical shift (open plain)<p>Missing is any regard for God&#8217;s will. Proverbs warns, &#8220;There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>). Human certainty apart from divine guidance invites humiliation (<a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-16</a>). The forthcoming defeat (<a href="/1_kings/20-29.htm">1 Kings 20:29-30</a>) will underscore that victory belongs to the LORD (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the king approved their plan and acted accordingly</b><p>Ben-hadad&#8217;s quick agreement illustrates leadership that listens to worldly counsel yet ignores prophetic warning. Earlier, a prophet foretold Israel&#8217;s victory (<a href="/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13-14</a>). Instead of seeking reconciliation with the Almighty, Ben-hadad doubles down on rebellion&#8212;mirroring Pharaoh&#8217;s hardened heart (<a href="/exodus/9-12.htm">Exodus 9:12</a>). Earthly rulers often choose expedience over repentance (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>), but God still uses their decisions to display His glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/20-25.htm">1 Kings 20:25</a> records Aram&#8217;s attempt to rebuild, rearm, and reposition for what they assume will be certain triumph.
