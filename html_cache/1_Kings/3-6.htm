This loving devotion, often translated as "chesed" in Hebrew, signifies a covenantal loyalty and mercy. David, despite his flaws, was a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>), and God's promises to him were rooted in this divine love. The Davidic Covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>) is a key context here, where God promised David that his lineage would endure forever, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p><b>because he walked before You in faithfulness, righteousness, and uprightness of heart.</b><br>David's life, though marked by sin, was characterized by a sincere commitment to God. His faithfulness is seen in his reliance on God throughout his reign, his righteousness in his pursuit of justice, and his uprightness in his genuine repentance (Psalm 51). This phrase highlights the biblical principle that God values the heart's intentions and integrity (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). David's life serves as a type of Christ, who perfectly embodied these qualities (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p><b>And You have maintained this loving devotion by giving him a son to sit on his throne this very day.</b><br>God's faithfulness to His promises is evident in Solomon's ascension to the throne. This continuation of David's lineage is a testament to God's unwavering commitment to His covenant. Solomon's reign marks a period of peace and prosperity, fulfilling part of God's promise to David. The throne of David is a prophetic symbol pointing to the eternal reign of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, whose kingdom will have no end (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>, <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).

He traces that love from David&#8217;s life of sincere obedience, through God&#8217;s ongoing commitment, to his own enthronement. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s promises are literal, dependable, and rooted in His character. Blessing flows to those who walk before Him with integrity, and every fulfillment today points forward to the greater fulfillment in Christ, the everlasting Son of David.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And Solomon said</span>.--On Solomon's "wisdom," see Note on <a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm" title="And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.">1Kings 4:29</a>. Here it is clear that the wisdom which he asks is that of the ruler, involving elements both moral and intellectual--the wisdom to discern and do true justice between man and man. He calls himself "a little child"--his age is variously estimated from twelve to twenty at this time--and trembles at the responsibility of ruling over "so great a people." But, in the characteristic spirit of the true godliness of the Old Testament, he looks for wisdom, not as the mere result of human teaching and experience, but as an inspiration of God, and prays for it accordingly, in a prayer of singular beauty and humility, pleading simply God's promise to his father, and its fulfilment in his own accession to the throne.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">wrought with</span>] <span class="cmt_word">thy servant David my father great mercy</span> [marg., <span class="accented">favour</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>according as he walked Before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee</span> [cf. <a href="/2_kings/20-3.htm">2 Kings 20:3</a>, where Hezekiah uses much the same language of himself.
