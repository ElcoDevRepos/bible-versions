Solomon's prayer is a model of intercession, reflecting a deep understanding of God's covenant with Israel. The temple was the central place of worship, symbolizing God's presence among His people. Solomon's petition emphasizes the importance of prayer and communication with God, a theme echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>, which encourages believers to present their requests to God.<p><b>be near to the LORD our God day and night</b><br>The request for the words to be near to God day and night highlights the continuous nature of prayer and God's constant watchfulness over His people. This reflects the idea of God's omnipresence and His readiness to hear the prayers of His people at all times. <a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a> reminds us that God neither slumbers nor sleeps, indicating His perpetual care and attention.<p><b>so that He may uphold the cause of His servant</b><br>Solomon refers to himself as God's servant, a term that denotes humility and submission to God's will. This reflects the biblical principle that leaders are to serve under God's authority. The phrase also implies a request for divine justice and support, aligning with the biblical theme of God as the defender of the righteous, as seen in <a href="/psalms/37-28.htm">Psalm 37:28</a>.<p><b>and of His people Israel</b><br>This phrase underscores the collective identity and covenant relationship between God and Israel. Israel is often referred to as God's chosen people, a nation set apart to fulfill His purposes. The historical context includes the establishment of Israel as a nation under God's law, with the temple serving as a focal point for worship and national identity. This covenant relationship is foundational to understanding the Old Testament narrative and God's redemptive plan.<p><b>as each day requires</b><br>The phrase suggests a daily dependence on God for guidance and provision. It reflects the biblical principle of daily reliance on God, as seen in the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16) and the Lord's Prayer, where Jesus teaches His disciples to ask for their daily bread (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>). This daily requirement emphasizes the need for ongoing faith and trust in God's provision and timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem and is offering a prayer of dedication to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, to whom Solomon directs his prayer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The newly constructed house of worship where Solomon is dedicating his prayer.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, for whom Solomon is interceding.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dedication_of_the_temple.htm">The Dedication of the Temple</a></b><br>A significant event where Solomon prays for God's continual presence and favor.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_persistent_prayer.htm">The Power of Persistent Prayer</a></b><br>Solomon's request for his words to be near to God day and night highlights the importance of continual prayer.

At all times he who brought the sacrifice was said to "offer" it. (See, for example, <a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm" title="And when any will offer a meat offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense thereon:">Leviticus 2:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/3-2.htm" title="And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.">Leviticus 3:2</a>; <a href="/leviticus/3-7.htm" title="If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the LORD.">Leviticus 3:7</a>, &c.) The priest accepted it in the name of the Lord, and poured the blood at the foot of the altar of sacrifice, or sprinkled it on the altar of incense. But still the absence of all mention of the priests, even as to the "hallowing" of the court for sacrifice, is characteristic of the tone of the whole narrative, in which the king alone is prominent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 59.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord, be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of</span> [Heb. to do the <span class="accented">judgment of</span>] <span class="cmt_word">his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the thing of a day in his day</span>.
