Known for his wisdom, Solomon's reign is often seen as a time of peace and prosperity for Israel. His rule is marked by significant building projects, including the construction of the First Temple in Jerusalem. Solomon's leadership style and decisions, such as conscripting labor, reflect the centralized power and administrative organization of his kingdom.<p><b>conscripted a labor force</b><br>The conscription of labor was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern monarchies for large-scale building projects. This labor force was not a standing army but rather a group of workers drafted for specific tasks. The use of conscripted labor highlights the demands of Solomon's ambitious building plans and the centralized authority he wielded. It also foreshadows the later discontent among the Israelites, which contributed to the division of the kingdom after Solomon's death.<p><b>of 30,000 men</b><br>The number 30,000 indicates the large scale of the workforce required for Solomon's projects, particularly the construction of the Temple. This figure underscores the magnitude of the task and the resources Solomon had at his disposal. It also reflects the organizational capabilities of his administration in mobilizing such a significant number of workers.<p><b>from all Israel</b><br>The phrase "from all Israel" suggests that the labor force was drawn from the entire nation, indicating a sense of national involvement in the building of the Temple. This inclusivity may have been intended to foster a sense of unity and shared purpose among the tribes. However, it also implies the burden placed on the people, which later became a point of contention leading to the kingdom's division. The involvement of all Israel in the Temple's construction can be seen as a type of the unity and collective worship that the Temple was meant to symbolize.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The united kingdom under Solomon's rule, consisting of the twelve tribes of Israel.

For in <a href="/1_kings/9-22.htm" title="But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no slaves: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.">1Kings 9:22</a> we read that "of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains." Thus exceptionally introduced at first for the special service of God, it may have been the beginning of what was hereafter an oppressive despotism over the Israelites themselves. Probably even now the Israelite labourers were (under the chief officers) put in authority over the great mass of 150,000 bondmen, evidently drawn from the native races. (See <a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm" title="And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.">2Chronicles 2:17</a>.) But the whole description suggests to us--what the history of Exodus, the monuments of Egypt, and the description by Herodotus of the building of the Pyramids confirm--the vast sacrifice of human labour and life, at which (in the absence of machinery to spare labour) the great monuments of ancient splendour were reared.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And King Solomon raised a levy</span> [Marg., <span class="accented">tribute of men, i.e.</span>, conscription] out of all Israel [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the people, not the land - Ewald] and the levy was thirty thousand men.
