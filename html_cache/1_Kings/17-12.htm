This phrase reflects the cultural and religious context of the time, where people often recognized the gods of other nations. Her oath by the LORD shows a level of respect or fear, possibly indicating the influence of Elijah's reputation or the widespread knowledge of the God of Israel.<p><b>I have no bread&#8212;</b><br>This statement highlights the dire situation of the widow. Bread was a staple food in ancient Near Eastern culture, and her lack of it underscores the severity of the famine affecting the land. The scarcity of bread is a recurring theme in the Bible, often symbolizing physical and spiritual need, as seen in the Lord's Prayer, "Give us this day our daily bread."<p><b>only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug.</b><br>The mention of flour and oil points to the basic ingredients for making bread, emphasizing her poverty. In ancient times, these were common household items, but her limited supply indicates extreme deprivation. This scarcity sets the stage for the miraculous provision that follows, reminiscent of God's provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<p><b>Look, I am gathering a couple of sticks</b><br>The act of gathering sticks suggests her preparation for a final meal, highlighting her desperation. Sticks were used for kindling fires, and her collection of just a few indicates the smallness of the meal she plans to prepare. This imagery of gathering sticks is also seen in <a href="/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32-36</a>, where a man is found gathering sticks on the Sabbath, underscoring the simplicity and necessity of the task.<p><b>to take home and prepare a meal for myself and my son,</b><br>The widow's focus on her son reveals her maternal instincts and the familial structure of the time. Her responsibility to provide for her child, even in the face of death, reflects the cultural emphasis on family and survival. This mirrors other biblical accounts of mothers in desperate situations, such as Hagar in <a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21</a>.<p><b>so that we may eat it and die.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase starkly portrays the hopelessness of her situation. The expectation of death after the meal underscores the severity of the famine and her lack of resources. It also sets the stage for God's intervention through Elijah, illustrating themes of faith and divine provision. This foreshadows the New Testament message of Jesus as the Bread of Life, offering eternal sustenance beyond physical needs (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God sent to deliver His messages and perform miracles.

In <a href="/1_kings/17-12.htm">1 Kings 17:12</a> Scripture spotlights human extremity so His sufficiency can be displayed.

Bahr is extremely positive on this point, affirming that, had she been a heathen, the words would have been positively hypocritical, and more, that Elijah would never have been sent (<a href="/luke/4-26.htm">Luke 4:26</a>) to an idolater. He further suggests that possibly she was an Israelite by birth, who had been married to a Phoenician. But all this is extremely doubtful. In the first place, it is noteworthy that the words are, "Jehovah <span class="accented">thy</span> God," words which show that she recognized Elijah, perhaps by his Jewish face, probably by his prophetic dress (<a href="/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>) as a worshipper of Jehovah. But had she also been the same, it is probable that she would have said "my God," for that form would not only have given greater force to her obtestation, but would have established <span class="cmt_word">a</span> bond of sympathy - such as Jews in a foreign land were only too glad to recognize - between them. And the remark that it is hypocrisy to swear by a god in whom one does not believe is disposed of by the consideration that she may well have believed in the Lord as well as in Baal. See note on 1 Kings 5:7. The Tyrians knew nothing of monotheism], <span class="cmt_word">I have not a cake</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b9;</span>, the synonym of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5bb;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (ver. 13), the smallest kind of bread. It was baked in the ashes; hence the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. We gather from this pitiful disclosure that the famine had already extended to Phoenicia, as it naturally would do, considering how dependent that country was on Israel for its breadstuffs; see note on 1 Kings 5:9,11. Josephus (Ant. 8:13, 2) cites Menander as attesting to a year's drought in the reign of Ethbaal], but an handful of meal in a [Heb. <span class="accented">the</span>] <span class="cmt_word">barrel</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, probably connected with <span class="accented">cadus, cadeau</span>, etc.; bucket, pail], <span class="cmt_word">and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a few sticks (Gesenius). We may compare the German idiom <span class="accented">ein Paar</span> and our "two or three." But "two" in this sense occurs nowhere else in the Bible - "two or three" is found in <a href="/2_kings/9-32.htm">2 Kings 9:32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>; <a href="/amos/4-8.htm">Amos 4:8</a>.

Bahr contends that Elijah first learnt from these words - the mention of a son and the absence of any mention of her husband - that he was addressing a "widow woman." But we read <a href="/genesis/38-14.htm">Genesis 38:14, 19</a>, of "garments of widowhood" (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17</a>), and ver. 10, "a widow woman," etc., almost implies that Elijah from the first <span class="accented">recognized</span> her as such], <span class="cmt_word">that we may eat it, and die.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/17-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But she replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
