In the context of <a href="/1_kings/8.htm">1 Kings 8</a>, Solomon is dedicating the temple, and this blessing is part of his prayer. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) emphasizes the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. This expression of blessing is common in the Psalms and other Old Testament passages, highlighting the importance of worship and gratitude in Israel's relationship with God.<p><b>who has given rest to His people Israel</b><br>The "rest" mentioned here refers to the peace and stability that Israel experienced under Solomon's reign, a fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs and through Moses. This rest is both physical, in terms of security from enemies, and spiritual, as the temple becomes a central place of worship. The concept of rest is also a foreshadowing of the ultimate rest found in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/4.htm">Hebrews 4</a>, where believers enter God's rest through faith.<p><b>according to all that He promised</b><br>This phrase underscores the faithfulness of God in fulfilling His covenant promises. The promises to Israel included land, nationhood, and blessing, as initially given to Abraham and reiterated through Moses. The fulfillment of these promises is a testament to God's unchanging nature and reliability, serving as a foundation for Israel's faith and obedience.<p><b>Not one word has failed</b><br>This statement emphasizes the perfection and reliability of God's word. In the ancient Near Eastern context, where human promises often failed, the unfailing nature of God's word set Him apart as the true and living God. This assurance is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus affirms that not one jot or tittle of the law will pass away until all is fulfilled (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>).<p><b>of all the good promises</b><br>The "good promises" refer to the blessings and favorable outcomes that God assured Israel, including prosperity, peace, and His presence among them. These promises are rooted in God's character and His desire for the well-being of His people. The goodness of God's promises is a recurring theme in Scripture, pointing to His benevolent nature and the ultimate good found in salvation through Christ.<p><b>He made through His servant Moses</b><br>Moses is highlighted as God's servant, a mediator of the covenant and the lawgiver. The promises made through Moses include the deliverance from Egypt, the giving of the law, and the guidance to the Promised Land. Moses' role as a servant is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate Servant and Mediator of a new and better covenant, as described in <a href="/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3:1-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who led the dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem.

Of the "rest" of Israel, the transfer of the Ark of the Lord from the shifting Tabernacle to the fixed Temple was at once a sign and a pledge. Yet Solomon's subsequent words imply that "entering into that rest" was conditional on fulfilment of Israel's part in the covenant, by "walking in the ways of the Lord." That condition, which he knew so well, he himself broke, and all Israel with him. Hence the fulfilment of the foreboding which emerges so constantly in his prayer. The glory of rest and happiness of his age was but a gleam of prosperity, soon to be swallowed up in dissension and disaster. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 56.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the Lord, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised</span> [a distinct reference to <a href="/deuteronomy/12-9.htm">Deuteronomy 12:9, 10</a> (cf. 3:20), where we read that when the Lord should have given rest to Israel, then a place for sacrifice, etc., should be appointed (ver. 11).
