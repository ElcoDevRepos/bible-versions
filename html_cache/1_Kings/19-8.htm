The act of eating and drinking signifies physical sustenance, but it also symbolizes spiritual nourishment. In the Bible, angels often serve as messengers and providers of God's care, as seen in <a href="/genesis/21-17.htm">Genesis 21:17-19</a> with Hagar and in <a href="/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a> with Jesus. Elijah's obedience in eating and drinking reflects his reliance on God's provision, a theme consistent throughout Scripture.<p><b>And strengthened by that food,</b><br>The food provided by the angel was not ordinary; it was divinely empowered to sustain Elijah for an extended journey. This miraculous sustenance parallels the manna given to the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 16), highlighting God's ability to provide for His people in extraordinary ways. It also prefigures the spiritual nourishment believers receive through Christ, the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>he walked forty days and forty nights</b><br>The duration of forty days and nights is significant in biblical numerology, often representing periods of testing, trial, or preparation. This mirrors the forty years the Israelites wandered in the desert (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>) and the forty days Jesus fasted in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). Elijah's journey is a time of spiritual preparation and reflection, aligning him with other pivotal biblical figures who underwent similar trials.<p><b>until he reached Horeb,</b><br>Horeb, also known as Mount Sinai, is a place of profound spiritual significance. It is where Moses encountered God in the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3:1-2</a>) and where the Ten Commandments were given (Exodus 19-20). Elijah's journey to Horeb signifies a return to the foundational place of God's covenant with Israel, suggesting a renewal of faith and mission.<p><b>the mountain of God.</b><br>This designation underscores Horeb's sacred status as a site of divine revelation and encounter. It is a place where God reveals His presence and purposes, as seen in Moses' experiences and later in Elijah's own encounter with God (<a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11-13</a>). The mountain serves as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-3</a>), and it foreshadows the transfiguration of Jesus, where He is revealed in glory on a mountain (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who is central to this passage.

It may, therefore, be thought to imply an interval of retirement for rest and solitary meditation, like the sojourn of Moses in Horeb, and the sojourn of our Lord in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm" title="And Moses went into the middle of the cloud, and got him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.">Exodus 24:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-2.htm" title="And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungered.">Matthew 4:2</a>) during which the spirit of the prophet might be calmed from the alternations of triumph and despondency, to receive the spiritual lesson which awaited him. During all that time he went "in the strength" of the Divine food, that he might know that "man doth not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm" title="And he humbled you, and suffered you to hunger, and fed you with manna, which you knew not, neither did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD does man live.">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights</span> [Cf. <a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9, 25</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>; <a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>. But the primary reference is perhaps to the "forty days and forty nights" which Moses spent in Horeb, during which he "neither did eat bread nor drink water" (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>), or to the forty years during which Israel was sustained in this same desert with "angels' food" (<a href="/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a>). It is noteworthy how both Moses and Elias were precursors of our Lord in a forty days' fast. "The three great fasters met gloriously on Tabor" (Hall). It is not implied that it took the prophet the whole of this time to reach Horeb, which is only distant from Beer-sheba some 130 miles.
