Solomon, the son of David, was known for his wisdom and for building the Temple in Jerusalem. This event marks a significant moment in Israel's history, as the Temple was the central place of worship and symbolized God's presence among His people. The gathering of "all Israel" indicates a national event, emphasizing the importance of the occasion and the unity of the tribes of Israel.<p><b>a great assembly of people from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt</b><br>Lebo-hamath and the Brook of Egypt define the northern and southern boundaries of Israel at the time, respectively. Lebo-hamath is located near the entrance to Hamath in modern-day Syria, while the Brook of Egypt is often identified with Wadi El-Arish in the Sinai Peninsula. This phrase underscores the vastness of the kingdom and the inclusivity of the celebration, as people from all over the land gathered. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>) and the extent of Solomon's reign (<a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>).<p><b>kept the feast before the LORD our God</b><br>The feast referred to here is the Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot), a significant Jewish festival that commemorates the Israelites' journey through the wilderness and God's provision. It is a time of rejoicing and thanksgiving, celebrated with offerings and sacrifices. The phrase "before the LORD our God" indicates that the celebration was not merely a social event but a religious observance, acknowledging God's sovereignty and blessings. This feast also foreshadows the ultimate dwelling of God with His people through Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>for seven days and seven more days&#8212;fourteen days in all</b><br>The celebration lasted for fourteen days, which included the seven days of the Feast of Tabernacles and an additional seven days, likely for the dedication of the Temple. This extended period of celebration highlights the significance of the Temple's completion and dedication. The number seven in the Bible often symbolizes completeness and perfection, reflecting the fulfillment of God's promises and the establishment of His dwelling place among His people. The dedication of the Temple and the extended feast can be seen as a type of the eternal celebration and worship in the presence of God, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who led the nation in the dedication of the temple.
