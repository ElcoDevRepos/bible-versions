These poles were made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold, as described in <a href="/exodus/25-13.htm">Exodus 25:13-15</a>. The extension of the poles signifies the careful adherence to God's instructions for handling the Ark, emphasizing the importance of reverence and obedience in worship.<p><b>that their ends were visible from the Holy Place</b><br>The Holy Place was the outer chamber of the temple, where priests performed daily rituals. The visibility of the poles from the Holy Place indicates the proximity of the Ark to the priests, symbolizing God's presence among His people. This arrangement highlights the accessibility of God to those who serve Him, while still maintaining a sense of sacred separation.<p><b>in front of the inner sanctuary</b><br>The inner sanctuary, also known as the Most Holy Place or the Holy of Holies, was the innermost and most sacred area of the temple, where the Ark was kept. Only the high priest could enter this space once a year on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2-34</a>). The positioning of the poles in front of the inner sanctuary underscores the holiness of the Ark and the divine presence it represented.<p><b>but not from outside the Holy Place</b><br>This detail emphasizes the exclusivity and sanctity of the temple's inner areas. The Ark and its poles were hidden from the view of the general populace, reinforcing the idea that access to God's presence was limited and required mediation through the priesthood. This foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest who grants believers direct access to God (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>and they are there to this day</b><br>This phrase suggests the enduring nature of the temple's sacred elements at the time the text was written. It serves as a testament to the historical reliability of the biblical account and the continuity of worship practices.
