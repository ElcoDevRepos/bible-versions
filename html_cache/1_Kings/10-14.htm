In the ancient Near East, gold was a symbol of wealth and power, and Solomon's accumulation of gold signifies the prosperity and influence of his reign. The annual influx of gold likely came from various sources, including trade, tribute from other nations, and taxes. This wealth enabled Solomon to undertake grand projects, such as the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem, which was a central place of worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people. The prosperity during Solomon's reign fulfilled God's promise to David that his son would have a peaceful and prosperous kingdom (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>).<p><b>was 666 talents</b><br>The specific number, 666 talents, is significant and has been the subject of much discussion. A talent was a large unit of weight, approximately 75 pounds or 34 kilograms, making 666 talents an enormous amount of gold. This number, 666, is also notable in biblical literature as it appears in <a href="/revelation/13-18.htm">Revelation 13:18</a>, where it is associated with the number of the beast. While the connection between these two uses of 666 is not explicitly explained in the Bible, some scholars suggest that it may symbolize the potential for wealth and power to lead to idolatry and moral corruption, a theme that is evident in Solomon's later years when he turned away from God (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4-6</a>). Solomon's wealth, while a blessing, also served as a test of his faithfulness to God, illustrating the biblical principle that material wealth can be both a blessing and a spiritual challenge.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.

Yet every related passage reminds us that riches remain God&#8217;s property, present a spiritual hazard, and cannot substitute for wholehearted devotion. Solomon&#8217;s wealth points beyond itself to the God who gives, who warns, and who invites His people to treasure Him above all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Talents</span>.--The word properly signifies a "circle," or "globe," and the talent (among the Hebrews and other Orientals, as among the Greeks) denoted properly a certain weight. (<span class= "ital">a</span>) The ordinary talent of gold contained 100 "manehs," or "portions" (the Greek <span class= "ital">mna</span>, or <span class= "ital">mina</span>), and each maneh (as is seen by comparing <a href="/1_kings/10-17.htm" title="And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.">1Kings 10:17</a> with <a href="/2_chronicles/9-16.htm" title="And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.">2Chronicles 9:16</a>) contained 100 shekels of gold. According to Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. xiv.</span> 7, 1), each maneh contained 2&#171; Roman pounds, and the talent, therefore, 250 Roman pounds, or 1,262,500 grains; and this agrees fairly with his computation elsewhere (<span class= "ital">Ant. iii.</span> 8, 10), that the gold shekel was equivalent to the <span class= "ital">daric</span>, which is about 129 grains. (See <span class= "ital">Dictionary</span> <span class= "ital">of the Bible</span>: "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.") According to this calculation, 666 talents would give a weight of gold now worth 7,780,000. (<span class= "ital">b</span>) On the other hand, the talent of silver is expressly given (by comparison of <a href="/context/exodus/30-13.htm" title="This they shall give, every one that passes among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.">Exodus 30:13-15</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/38-25.htm" title="And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and three score and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:">Exodus 38:25-28</a>) at 3,000 "shekels of the sanctuary," and such a shekel appears, by the extant Maccabaean coins, to be about 220 grains. Of such talents, 666 would give a little more than half the former weight; hence, if the talent of gold here be supposed to be in weight the same as the talent of silver, the whole would give a weight of gold now worth about 4,000,000. Considering that this is expressly stated to be independent of certain customs and tributes, the smaller sum seems more probable; in any case, the amount is surprisingly large. But it should be remembered that at certain times and places accumulations of gold have taken place, so great as practically to reduce its value, and lead to its employment, not as a currency, but as a precious ornament. Making all allowance for exaggeration, this must have been the case among the Mexicans and Peruvians before the Spanish conquests. It is not improbable that the same may have occurred in the time of Solomon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the weight of gold that</span> <span class="cmt_word">came to Solomon in one year</span> [probably one particular and exceptional year, probably also the year of the queen's visit, not year by year (Wordsworth, <span class="accented">al</span>.), as the Vulgate (<span class="accented">per singulos annos</span>). One fleet only came home from its voyage after three years, and the gold would hardly weigh precisely 666 talents year by year] <span class="cmt_word">was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold.</span> [The correspondence with the number of the Beast (<a href="/revelation/13-18.htm">Revelation 13:18</a>; cf. <a href="/ezra/2-13.htm">Ezra 2:13</a>) is in all probability not altogether accidental. It is possible, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that the number of the beast is a reminiscence of this number of talents. For we may surely see in this statement of Solomon's prodigious wealth an indication of his worldliness, the turning point, perhaps, in his estrangement from God. "The love of money" may have been the root of all his evil. It is certainly remarkable that from this time forward his career is one of steady declension. It is also remarkable that while he is here represented to us as a "royal merchant," the mark of the beast is on the <span class="accented">buyers</span> and <span class="accented">sellers</span> (<a href="/revelation/13-17.htm">Revelation 13:17</a>). But see "Expositor," May, 1881. It is, of course, possible that the number has been corrupted, but, on the other hand, it may have been recorded, partly because of the singularity of the sum total. The 666 talents include the receipts from all sources - taxes, tribute, and voyages - with the exception made presently (ver. 15). Rawlinson quotes Keil (in his earlier edition) as estimating this amount at &pound;3,646,350. But in his later work, Keil puts it in round numbers at two and a half millions (17,000,000 thalers), while Mr. Peele calculates it at about &pound;8,000,000. These widely varying figures are instructive, as showing that both estimates are little more than guesswork. We do not know the value of the Hebrew talent, nor, indeed, can it ever be rightly appraised until we know its purchasing power. The <span class="accented">denarius, e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, is generally valued at 8&frac12; d. (or 7&frac12; d.) because it contained some 58 grains of pure silver but its real <span class="accented">value</span> was nearer three shillings, inasmuch as it was a fair wage for a day's work on the land (<a href="/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>). In any case, it is clear that this sum should hardly be compared with the <span class="accented">annual</span> revenue of other Oriental empires, as by Rawlinson (see above). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/10-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The weight</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;qal)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4948.htm">Strong's 4948: </a> </span><span class="str2">Weight, weighing</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of gold</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1428;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;z&#257;&#183;h&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
