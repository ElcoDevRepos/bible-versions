Ben-hadad, the king of Aram, acknowledges the previous conquests by his father, likely Ben-hadad I, who had taken cities from Israel. This act of restoration signifies a political and military concession, indicating a shift in power dynamics. The cities in question were likely part of the northern territories of Israel, which were strategically important for trade and defense.<p><b>you may set up your own marketplaces in Damascus,</b><br>Allowing Israel to set up marketplaces in Damascus suggests a significant economic concession. Damascus was a major trade hub in the ancient Near East, and this agreement would have opened up economic opportunities for Israel. This reflects the importance of trade and commerce in ancient times and highlights the interconnectedness of the region's economies. It also indicates a level of cooperation and peace between the two nations, at least temporarily.<p><b>as my father did in Samaria.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates a reciprocal arrangement that had previously existed, where Aram had similar privileges in Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. This historical reference suggests a precedent for such treaties and highlights the cyclical nature of political alliances and conflicts in the region. Samaria was a significant city, and such arrangements would have been beneficial for both parties involved.<p><b>&#8220;By this treaty I release you,&#8221; Ahab replied.</b><br>King Ahab's response indicates his acceptance of the terms and his willingness to enter into a treaty with Ben-hadad. This decision can be seen as a pragmatic political move, aimed at securing peace and stability for Israel. However, from a theological perspective, Ahab's actions might be viewed critically, as he fails to seek divine guidance or consider the prophetic word previously given by God's prophets. This reflects Ahab's often-compromised spiritual leadership.<p><b>So he made a treaty with him and sent him away.</b><br>The finalization of the treaty and Ben-hadad's release mark the conclusion of this episode. This act of diplomacy, while politically expedient, is later criticized by the prophet in the subsequent verses, as it demonstrates Ahab's failure to fully execute God's judgment against Aram. This decision foreshadows future conflicts and highlights the tension between political expediency and obedience to divine commands. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the importance of aligning political actions with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) who was defeated by the Israelites.

Ben-hadad, powerless, promises to return cities and open Damascus to Israelite trade. Ahab, enticed by territorial and economic gain, seals a treaty and releases the very king God had delivered for judgment. The verse exposes a fatal exchange: obedience to God bartered for short-term advantage. The episode warns that treaties born of compromise, not covenant faithfulness, invite future ruin and divine rebuke.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Make streets</span>--properly, <span class= "ital">squares, </span>or <span class= "ital">quarters of a city. </span>This concession implies a virtual acknowledgment of supremacy; for the right to have certain quarters for residence, for trade, perhaps even for garrison, in the capital of a king, belongs only to one who has sovereignty over him. Hence it goes beyond the significance of the restoration of the cities--conquered, it would seem, from Omri, unless, indeed, taking "father" in the sense of predecessor, the reference is to the Syrian victories in the days of Baasha. (See <a href="/1_kings/15-20.htm" title="So Benhadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.">1Kings 15:20</a>.) The narrative seems to convey an idea that the covenant was made hastily, on insufficient security. The great point, however, was that a war, victoriously conducted under prophetic guidance, should not have been concluded without prophetic sanction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ben-hadad said unto him The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore</span> [We can hardly see in these words "the terms of peace which he is willing to offer as the price of his freedom" (Rawlinson), because he was absolutely at Ahab's mercy, and was not in a position to make any stipulations; but they express Ben-hadad's idea of the results which must follow the conquest. His utter defeat would necessitate this reconstruction of their respective territories, etc. We cannot be quite certain that the cities here referred to are those enumerated in <a href="/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>, as taken by Ben-hadad's armies from Baasha. For Baasha was not the father, nor even was he the "ancestor" (as Keil, later edition) of Ahab, but belonged to a different dynasty. At the same time it <span class="cmt_word">is</span> quite conceivable that a prince in Ben-hadad's position, in his ignorance or forgetfulness of the history of Israel, might use the word "father" improperly, or even in the sense of "predecessor." We know that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span> had a very extended signification.] Keil and Bahr, however, think that we have a reference to some war in the reign of Omri (cf. <a href="/1_kings/16-27.htm">1 Kings 16:27</a>), which is not recorded in Scripture. And the words which follow make this extremely probable, inasmuch as in Baasha's days Samaria had no existence] ? <span class="cmt_word">and thou shalt make streets</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> lit., <span class="accented">whatever is without</span>; hence streets, spaces, quarters] <span class="cmt_word">for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.</span> [The commentators are agreed that a permission to establish bazaars or quarters, in which the Hebrews might live and trade, is here conceded]. <span class="cmt_word">Then said Ahab</span> [These words are rightly supplied by our translators. The meaning would have been quite clear had the Hebrews been familiar with the use of quotation marks.
