In the ancient Near Eastern context, a name represented one's character and authority. God's "great name" signifies His supreme power and holiness. The fame of God's name was often spread through His mighty acts, such as the deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>) and the conquest of Canaan. This anticipates the universal recognition of God's sovereignty, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22-23</a>, where all nations are called to acknowledge Him.<p><b>and mighty hand</b><br>The "mighty hand" is a metaphor for God's power and intervention in human history. It recalls the Exodus narrative, where God delivered Israel from slavery with a "mighty hand" (<a href="/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>). This expression underscores God's ability to act decisively and powerfully on behalf of His people. It also serves as a reminder of His past faithfulness, encouraging trust in His continued protection and provision.<p><b>and outstretched arm&#8212;</b><br>The "outstretched arm" complements the "mighty hand," emphasizing God's readiness to act and His active involvement in the world. This imagery is often associated with deliverance and salvation, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a> and <a href="/psalms/136-12.htm">Psalm 136:12</a>. It conveys the idea of God reaching out to save and support His people, a theme that finds its ultimate fulfillment in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who is described as the arm of the Lord in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>.<p><b>when he comes and prays toward this temple,</b><br>This phrase refers to the foreigner who, upon hearing of God's great name and mighty deeds, is drawn to worship Him. The temple in Jerusalem was the designated place for God's presence and the focal point of Israelite worship. Praying toward the temple signifies acknowledging God's dwelling place and seeking His favor. This anticipates the inclusion of Gentiles in the worship of the true God, a theme further developed in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>). The temple itself is a type of Christ, who declared Himself the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), where all nations can come to find reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem and is offering a prayer of dedication in this chapter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Non-Israelites who hear of God's greatness and come to worship Him at the temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_great_name.htm">God's Great Name</a></b><br>Represents God's character, reputation, and the reverence due to Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mighty_hand_and_outstretched_arm.htm">Mighty Hand and Outstretched Arm</a></b><br>Metaphors for God's power and intervention in human history, often associated with His deliverance of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_universal_call.htm">God's Universal Call</a></b><br>God's greatness is not limited to Israel; it is meant to be recognized by all nations.
