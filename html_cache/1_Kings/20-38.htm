Prophets in the Old Testament frequently delivered messages directly from God to kings and leaders, often involving judgment or instruction. The road signifies a place of encounter, a common setting for divine messages to be delivered, as seen in other biblical narratives such as the encounter between Samuel and Saul. The king in this context is Ahab, a ruler known for his idolatry and disobedience to God, setting the stage for a confrontation that would reveal divine judgment.<p><b>disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes</b><br>The act of disguise is significant in biblical narratives, often used to convey a deeper message or to fulfill a divine purpose. In this instance, the prophet's disguise with a bandage over his eyes serves as a symbolic act. It reflects the spiritual blindness of King Ahab, who fails to see and understand God's will. Disguises are used elsewhere in Scripture, such as when Saul disguises himself to visit the witch of Endor, highlighting themes of deception and the consequences of straying from God's commands. The bandage may also symbolize the impending judgment and the need for Ahab to see the truth of his actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophet.htm">The Prophet</a></b><br>A man of God who delivers messages from the Lord.

This journey sets the stage for a living parable aimed at King Ahab.<p>&#8226; The action underscores personal responsibility. Just as Ahab was accountable for releasing Ben-Hadad (<a href="/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>), the prophet is accountable to deliver God&#8217;s verdict.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and waited on the road</b><p>&#8226; Waiting along the roadside recalls strategic prophetic encounters such as Samuel meeting Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/9-27.htm">1 Samuel 9:27</a>) and Elijah meeting Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/21-18.htm">1 Kings 21:18-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The road is a place of exposure and decision; Ahab cannot avoid the confrontation. Compare Jesus&#8217; roadside questions to His disciples on the Emmaus road (<a href="/luke/24-13.htm">Luke 24:13-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Patience here models faithful readiness&#8212;similar to Isaiah&#8217;s watchman stance (<a href="/isaiah/21-5.htm">Isaiah 21:5-8</a>)&#8212;until the chosen moment arrives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the king</b><p>&#8226; Addressing the king highlights divine authority over earthly rulers (<a href="/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10-12</a>). Ahab may sit on Israel&#8217;s throne, but the prophet represents the ultimate King.<p>&#8226; Prophetic ministry to royalty has a long line: Nathan to David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-7</a>), Elijah to Ahaziah (<a href="/2_kings/1-3.htm">2 Kings 1:3-4</a>), and John the Baptist to Herod (<a href="/mark/6-18.htm">Mark 6:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The target audience shows the gravity of the message: leaders are judged more strictly (<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>) because their choices shape a nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>disguising himself</b><p>&#8226; Disguise allows the message to land before Ahab recognizes the messenger, paralleling Nathan&#8217;s parable to David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-7</a>).<p>&#8226; God sometimes conceals truth momentarily to expose hearts, as when Joseph hid his identity from his brothers (<a href="/genesis/42-7.htm">Genesis 42:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Disguise also protects the prophet; Ahab had shown hostility toward prophetic rebukes (<a href="/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35-36</a>).

Like Ezekiel&#8217;s symbolic actions (<a href="/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1-3</a>), the injury turns the prophet into a living illustration.<p>&#8226; A covered eye hints at impaired vision&#8212;mirroring Ahab&#8217;s moral blindness in sparing Ben-Hadad against God&#8217;s command (<a href="/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>).<p>&#8226; When the bandage is removed, sight is restored, underscoring that true vision comes from submitting to God&#8217;s revealed will (<a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/20-38.htm">1 Kings 20:38</a> pictures a prophet who, in full obedience, stages a roadside drama to confront King Ahab. His strategic waiting, purposeful disguise, and eye bandage combine to create a vivid object lesson: the king&#8217;s leniency toward a divinely-condemned enemy stemmed from spiritual blindness. The verse reminds us that God holds leaders accountable, exposes hidden motives, and uses even a wounded servant to deliver truth with unmistakable clarity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">Ashes upon his face.</span>--It should be a "bandage over his head," to cover his face, and to accord with the appearance of a wounded soldier.
