The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a peaceful passing and a joining with ancestors. It reflects the belief in an afterlife where the deceased are gathered to their people, as seen in <a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a> with Abraham.<p><b>and was buried with them in the City of David;</b><br>The City of David refers to Jerusalem, specifically the ancient part of the city that David captured from the Jebusites and established as his capital (<a href="/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>). Being buried in the City of David was an honor, signifying Rehoboam's royal status and lineage. This burial place underscores the continuity of the Davidic dynasty, which holds significant messianic implications as prophesied in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>.<p><b>his mother&#8217;s name was Naamah the Ammonite.</b><br>Naamah's identity as an Ammonite highlights the political alliances formed through marriage during Solomon's reign, as he took many foreign wives (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>). The Ammonites were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>) and often in conflict with Israel. Her mention here may imply the influence of foreign cultures and religions in Judah, contributing to the spiritual decline during Rehoboam's reign (<a href="/1_kings/14-22.htm">1 Kings 14:22-24</a>).<p><b>And his son Abijam reigned in his place.</b><br>Abijam, also known as Abijah, succeeded Rehoboam as king of Judah. His reign continued the Davidic line, which is crucial for the fulfillment of God's covenant with David. Despite his short reign and the continuation of idolatrous practices (<a href="/1_kings/15-3.htm">1 Kings 15:3</a>), the preservation of the Davidic line is significant in biblical history, ultimately leading to the birth of Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah, as outlined in the genealogies of <a href="/matthew/1-7.htm">Matthew 1:7</a> and <a href="/luke/3-31.htm">Luke 3:31</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, whose reign was marked by division and conflict.

Scripture frequently uses &#8220;rested with his fathers&#8221; as a respectful way to describe death (<a href="/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-16.htm">2 Chronicles 12:16</a>).<p>&#8226; It underlines continuity: each generation lives, serves, and then yields to the next (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>).<p>&#8226; It signals accountability. Rehoboam&#8217;s reign had been marked by spiritual compromise (<a href="/1_kings/14-22.htm">1 Kings 14:22&#8211;24</a>), and now his opportunities were complete (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording the fact without embellishment, the verse shows God&#8217;s Word treats every earthly ruler as mortal and answerable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And was buried with them in the City of David</b><p>Rehoboam&#8217;s burial &#8220;with them&#8221; in Jerusalem (called &#8220;the City of David,&#8221; <a href="/1_kings/2-10.htm">1 Kings 2:10</a>) reinforces several truths:<p>&#8226; Covenant promise: God had assured David that his descendants would sit on the throne in Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>). Rehoboam&#8217;s burial in that same city confirms the ongoing Davidic line.<p>&#8226; Honor and legitimacy: Burial among predecessors publicly affirms his rightful place, despite the kingdom&#8217;s division during his rule (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; Reminder of heritage: Every time a king was laid in the royal tombs, the nation could reflect on past faithfulness and failures (<a href="/2_chronicles/9-31.htm">2 Chronicles 9:31</a>), urging renewed devotion to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Naamah the Ammonite</b><p>The verse pauses to restate Rehoboam&#8217;s maternal lineage (already noted in <a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>). Scripture repeats this detail to highlight:<p>&#8226; Influence of foreign alliances: Solomon&#8217;s marriage to Naamah the Ammonite (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1&#8211;2</a>) foreshadowed the idolatry that later plagued Judah (<a href="/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal responsibility: While Rehoboam inherited political authority, he also inherited spiritual complexities. His mixed heritage did not excuse his disobedience; rather, it sets the backdrop for choices he made (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-1.htm">2 Chronicles 12:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty: Even through an Ammonite mother&#8212;outside Israel&#8217;s covenant people&#8212;the Lord still advanced David&#8217;s line, illustrating grace operating amid human weakness (<a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his son Abijam reigned in his place</b><p>With Rehoboam gone, &#8220;his son Abijam reigned in his place,&#8221; showing the baton of leadership passes on. Important observations:<p>&#8226; The promised dynasty endures. Despite division and sin, God preserves David&#8217;s house (<a href="/1_kings/15-4.htm">1 Kings 15:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11</a>).<p>&#8226; A fresh chapter begins: Abijam (also called Abijah, <a href="/2_chronicles/13-1.htm">2 Chronicles 13:1</a>) will receive his own evaluation&#8212;he &#8220;walked in all the sins of his father&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/15-3.htm">1 Kings 15:3</a>). Each generation answers personally to the Lord (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Continuity of history: The biblical record moves forward, yet every reign builds on the spiritual groundwork laid before (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). What Rehoboam planted, Abijam would partially reap.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a> ties a definitive bow on Rehoboam&#8217;s reign: he dies, is buried with earlier kings, his mixed heritage is recalled, and the throne passes to Abijam. The verse underscores human mortality, the steadfastness of God&#8217;s covenant with David, the enduring consequences of past choices, and the fresh accountability each new leader faces. In just one sentence, Scripture reminds us that kingdoms rise and fall, but the Lord&#8217;s purposes march on&#8212;calling every generation to faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Rehoboam slept with his fathers</span> [The same formula as in <a href="/1_kings/2-10.htm">1 Kings 2:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-8.htm">1 Kings 15:8, 24</a>, etc. It is used of nearly all the kings of Judah], <span class="cmt_word">and was buried with his fathers</span> [These words go to prove, against Gesenius, that the phrase "slept (lit. <span class="accented">lay down</span>) with his fathers" is not to be interpreted of Sheol, but of the grave; see on 1 Kings 2:10] <span class="cmt_word">in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.</span> [Same words as in ver. 21. The repetition can hardly be, as Bahr, Wordsworth, <span class="accented">al</span>., imagine, designed, in order to show that the worship of Moloch was brought by her to Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>), and that she exercised a sinister influence upon her son. As she is twice called "the Ammonitess" it can hardly be doubted that she was one of the "Ammonitesses" (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1</a>, Hebrews) who turned away Solomon's heart; and it is also certain that Rehoboam did not inherit his folly from his father. At the same time these words are more easily accounted for on the supposition that the historian found them in this position in one or more of the documents from which he compiled his history. It is also to be remembered that some of these chronological statements are manifestly by a later hand, and have been transferred from the margin to the text. See on 1 Kings 6:1.] <span class="cmt_word">And Abijam</span> [elsewhere called <span class="accented">Abijah</span> (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-16.htm">2 Chronicles 12:16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-1.htm">2 Chronicles 13:1</a>), or <span class="accented">Abijahu</span> (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-21.htm">2 Chronicles 13:21</a>, Hebrews) Some MSS. have Abijah here. The variation is not easily accounted for except as a clerical error. The supposition of Lightfoot that the name was designedly altered by the historian <span class="cmt_word">to</span> avoid the incorporation of the sacred JAH into the name of a bad man is too fanciful, the more so as Abijam was by no means an exceptionally bad king. It is, however, approved by Bahr and Rawlinson. But it is as little probable that Abijam is the original form of the name (Keil). The form <span class="accented">Abijahu</span>, the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span>, and the analogy of <span class="accented">Abiel</span> (<a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>) all make against this idea.
