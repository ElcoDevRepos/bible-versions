God's anger is not capricious but is a righteous response to sin and disobedience. Solomon, despite his wisdom and the blessings he received, failed to uphold the covenant by turning to idolatry. This anger reflects God's holiness and justice, as He cannot tolerate sin, especially from those He has chosen and blessed.<p><b>because his heart had turned away from the LORD</b><br>The heart in biblical terms often refers to the center of one's being, including mind, will, and emotions. Solomon's heart turning away signifies a deep-seated apostasy, not just a momentary lapse. This turning away is significant because Solomon had been given wisdom and understanding beyond any other king. His heart's departure from God is a cautionary tale about the dangers of complacency and the influence of foreign alliances and marriages, which led him to idolatry.<p><b>the God of Israel</b><br>This title emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and the nation of Israel. It underscores the special status Israel held as God's chosen people, a status that came with responsibilities and expectations. Solomon's actions were not just personal failings but had national implications, as the king's faithfulness was integral to the nation's covenantal blessings.<p><b>who had appeared to him twice</b><br>God's appearances to Solomon were significant events, marking divine favor and communication. The first appearance was at Gibeon, where God granted Solomon wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5-14</a>), and the second was after the dedication of the temple, where God reaffirmed His covenant with Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/9-2.htm">1 Kings 9:2-9</a>). These appearances highlight the gravity of Solomon's sin, as he turned away despite direct encounters with God. This serves as a reminder of the seriousness of turning away from God after receiving clear revelation and blessings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.

God, ever faithful as &#8220;the God of Israel,&#8221; calls His people&#8212;leaders and followers alike&#8212;to unwavering loyalty, reminding us that privilege heightens, rather than lessens, our accountability to walk in wholehearted obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice.</span> [cf. 1 Kings 3:5 and 1 Kings 9:2.
