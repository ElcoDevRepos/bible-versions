Asa was the third king of Judah and reigned from approximately 911 to 870 BC. Baasha was the third king of the northern kingdom of Israel, reigning from about 909 to 886 BC. The division of the united monarchy into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah occurred after the reign of Solomon, leading to frequent hostilities between the two kingdoms. This conflict reflects the broader theme of division and strife that characterized the period of the divided monarchy. The animosity between the two kingdoms was not only political but also religious, as Israel often strayed from the worship of Yahweh, while Judah, under Asa, sought to maintain religious reforms.<p><b>throughout their days.</b><br>The phrase "throughout their days" indicates that the conflict between Asa and Baasha was a persistent issue during their respective reigns. This ongoing war suggests a period of instability and tension that would have affected the daily lives of the people in both kingdoms. The continuous nature of the conflict highlights the deep-seated division and rivalry that existed between Israel and Judah. Historically, this period was marked by frequent skirmishes and battles, as both kings sought to assert their dominance and control over strategic territories. The enduring conflict also underscores the failure of both kingdoms to achieve lasting peace and unity, a theme that resonates throughout the narrative of the divided monarchy. This persistent warfare can be seen as a consequence of the spiritual and moral decline that followed the division of the kingdom, as prophesied in earlier scriptures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>Asa was the king of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry.
