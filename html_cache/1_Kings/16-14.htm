His reign was marked by idolatry and moral decline, continuing the sinful practices of his father. The phrase suggests that there were additional deeds and events during Elah's reign that are not detailed in the biblical narrative, indicating a broader historical context that the biblical authors chose not to include. This reflects the selective nature of biblical history, focusing on theological rather than exhaustive historical accounts.<p><b>along with all his accomplishments</b><br>The term "accomplishments" may refer to any significant events or achievements during Elah's reign, though the biblical text does not specify them. This could include military campaigns, building projects, or political alliances. However, Elah's reign was short-lived, lasting only two years, and was characterized by instability and eventual assassination by Zimri, one of his officials. This brevity and turmoil suggest that his accomplishments were limited or overshadowed by his failures.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</b><br>This phrase points to an external source, the "Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel," which is not part of the biblical canon but was likely a historical record of the reigns of the kings of Israel. This book is frequently referenced in the accounts of the kings, indicating that it was a well-known source of historical information at the time. The mention of this book underscores the historical reality of these events and suggests that the biblical authors had access to other records when compiling their narratives. It also highlights the practice of ancient Near Eastern cultures to maintain detailed royal annals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elah.htm">Elah</a></b><br>The son of Baasha, Elah was the king of Israel who reigned for two years.

Those details, however, are absent because they contribute nothing to the spiritual narrative of Israel&#8217;s decline.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently weighs a king&#8217;s life by covenant loyalty, not by political success (see <a href="/1_kings/14-22.htm">1 Kings 14:22-24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Even impressive achievements cannot offset persistent rebellion. The contrast is stark when we recall David, whose reign is summarized with the opposite emphasis: &#8220;David did what was right in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/15-5.htm">1 Kings 15:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</b><p>&#8226; This lost royal archive, also cited in <a href="/2_kings/1-18.htm">2 Kings 1:18</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>, was a secular record maintained by court scribes.<p>&#8226; By pointing readers there, the inspired author affirms that verifiable history exists outside the biblical text while simultaneously declaring that the essential, God-breathed account is what we have before us (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement underscores the completeness of Scripture&#8217;s theological message: nothing necessary for faith or obedience is missing, even if many political details are.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/16-14.htm">1 Kings 16:14</a> is more than a routine footnote; it contrasts human archives with God&#8217;s selective, Spirit-inspired record. Elah&#8217;s forgotten achievements may have impressed his contemporaries, yet Scripture preserves only what reveals the moral and spiritual state of the king and the nation. The verse quietly urges us to measure a life not by its earthly accomplishments but by its fidelity to the LORD, whose evaluation&#8212;unlike court chronicles&#8212;endures forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/16-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for the rest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1435;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ye&#183;&#7791;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
