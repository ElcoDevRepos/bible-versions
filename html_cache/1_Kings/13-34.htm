Jeroboam established golden calves at Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>) to prevent his people from worshiping in Jerusalem, which was in the southern kingdom of Judah. This act was a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>) and set a precedent for future kings of Israel, leading them into further idolatry and apostasy.<p><b>that led to its extermination</b><br>The phrase "led to its extermination" indicates the severe consequences of Jeroboam's sin. The northern kingdom of Israel was eventually conquered by the Assyrians in 722 BC, leading to the exile of its people (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). This destruction was a fulfillment of the prophetic warnings given by prophets like Amos and Hosea, who called Israel to repentance but also foretold judgment due to their persistent idolatry and disobedience.<p><b>and destruction from the face of the earth.</b><br>The "destruction from the face of the earth" emphasizes the complete removal of Jeroboam's dynasty and the northern kingdom's identity. The ten tribes of Israel were scattered, often referred to as the "Lost Tribes of Israel." This phrase underscores the biblical principle that persistent sin and rebellion against God lead to judgment and loss. It also serves as a warning to future generations about the dangers of turning away from God's commandments. Theologically, it highlights the seriousness with which God views idolatry and the importance of faithfulness to His covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.
