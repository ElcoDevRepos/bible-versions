Elisha, meaning "God is salvation," is identified as the son of Shaphat, indicating his lineage and possibly his family's wealth, as they owned multiple oxen. This moment marks the beginning of Elisha's prophetic ministry, which will later be characterized by miracles and leadership in Israel. The act of finding Elisha suggests divine guidance in the selection of a prophet who will continue Elijah's work.<p><b>He was plowing with twelve teams of oxen, and he was with the twelfth team.</b><br>The mention of twelve teams of oxen highlights the substantial resources of Elisha's family, suggesting they were prosperous landowners. The number twelve often symbolizes completeness or the tribes of Israel, indicating the significance of Elisha's calling. Elisha working with the twelfth team shows his active participation in labor, reflecting humility and diligence. This setting underscores the transition from a life of agriculture to one of spiritual leadership, paralleling the call of other biblical figures who were called from ordinary tasks to divine missions.<p><b>Elijah passed by him and threw his cloak around him.</b><br>Elijah's act of throwing his cloak, or mantle, around Elisha is a symbolic gesture of transferring prophetic authority and responsibility. The mantle represents Elijah's prophetic office and the power of God that accompanies it. This act is reminiscent of the passing of leadership seen in other biblical narratives, such as Moses to Joshua. The cloak signifies the anointing and calling of Elisha to continue Elijah's work, foreshadowing the greater works Elisha will perform. This moment can also be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus calls His disciples to follow Him, leaving their former lives behind for a higher purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God known for his powerful ministry and miracles, including the confrontation with the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel.
