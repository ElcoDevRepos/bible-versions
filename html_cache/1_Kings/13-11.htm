By the time of <a href="/1_kings/13.htm">1 Kings 13</a>, it had become a center of idolatrous worship under King Jeroboam, who set up golden calves there (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-29</a>). The presence of an old prophet in Bethel suggests a remnant of those who once followed Yahweh, though his actions later reveal a compromised faith. This prophet's age may imply wisdom and experience, yet his later deception indicates a moral decline, reflecting the spiritual state of Israel.<p><b>and his sons came and told him all the deeds that the man of God had done that day in Bethel</b><br>The sons of the old prophet serve as witnesses to the events involving the man of God, a figure sent by God to prophesy against the altar at Bethel (<a href="/1_kings/13.htm">1 Kings 13:1-3</a>). Their report highlights the impact of the man of God's actions, which included miraculous signs such as the altar splitting apart. This incident underscores the theme of divine intervention and judgment against idolatry. The sons' role as informants also sets the stage for the old prophet's subsequent actions, illustrating the spread of news and the interconnectedness of communities in ancient Israel.<p><b>They also told their father the words that the man had spoken to the king</b><br>The words spoken by the man of God to King Jeroboam were a direct challenge to the king's authority and religious practices, predicting the downfall of the altar and the rise of a future king, Josiah, who would destroy the idolatrous sites (<a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>). This prophecy connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's sovereignty and the eventual fulfillment of His word, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15-20</a> when Josiah fulfills the prophecy.

<a href="/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3</a>).<p>&#8226; His anonymity underscores that spiritual authority flows from God&#8217;s calling, not fame (cf. <a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32&#8211;38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was living in Bethel</b><p>&#8220;was living in Bethel&#8221;<p>&#8226;

The verse sets a scene of contrast: genuine revelation amid a compromised religious center, curiosity without commitment, and the solemn responsibility that comes with hearing God&#8217;s word. It teaches that awareness of God&#8217;s acts and words requires faithful alignment, lest knowledge become a snare rather than a blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">An old prophet in Bethel.</span>--The narrative clearly implies--and, indeed, part of its most striking instructiveness depends on this--that this old prophet was not a mere pretender to prophetic inspiration, nor an apostate from the worship of Jehovah. Like Balaam, he united true prophetic gifts with a low worldliness of temper, capable on occasion of base subterfuge and deceit. Such union of elements, which should be utterly discordant, is only too characteristic of man's self-contradictory nature. He had thrown in his lot with Jeroboam's policy, which did not want plausible grounds of defence: in spite of this adhesion, he desired to continue still a prophet of the Lord, and to support the king's action by prophetic influence. It has been noticed that, after the maintenance of the idolatry of Beth-el, even the true prophets did not break off their ministry to the kingdom of Israel, and that, indeed, they never appeared in open hostility to that kingdom, till the introduction of Baal worship. But their case is altogether different from that of the old prophet. He deliberately supports the idolatry, and that by the worst of falsehoods--a falsehood in the name of God. They rebuke the sin (see <a href="/1_kings/14-9.htm" title="But have done evil above all that were before you: for you have gone and made you other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back:">1Kings 14:9</a>), but do not forsake their ministry to the sinner.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there dwelt an old prophet</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">a certain</span> (lit. one) <span class="accented">old prophet</span>.

For we cannot suppose that a sense of duty had kept this prophet at his post (see note on ver. 1). The fact that he remained, not only in the kingdom, but at its ecclesiastical capital; that he stood by without protest when the schism was being effected, and that, though not present himself at the sacrifice, he permitted his sons to be there, is a sufficient index to his character. It is quite possible that strong political sympathies had warped his judgment, and that he had persuaded himself that the policy of Jeroboam was necessitated by the division of the kingdom, which he knew to be from the Lord, and which one of his own order had foretold. Or it may be that, despite his better judgment, he had gone with his tribe and the majority of the nation, and now felt it difficult to withdraw from a false position. Or, finally, he may have taken the side of Jeroboam because of the greater honours and rewards that prince had to bestow (see on ver. 18). There is a striking similarity between his position and action and that of Balaam]; <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">his sons</span> [The Heb. has <span class="accented">son</span>; The LXX., Syr., and Vulg., <span class="accented">sons</span>. It is quite true that a "very slight change in the Hebrew text would bring it into accordance with the Septuagint here" (Rawlinson, similarly Ewald), but it would be against sound principles of textual criticism to make it. It is much more likely that the LXX. and other versions <span class="accented">have</span> been altered already, and that the plural has been introduced here because it is uniformly found in the later narrative. "<span class="accented">His</span> <span class="accented">son"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;</span>), as the <span class="accented">lectio</span> <span class="accented">ardua</span>, is therefore to he retained. The use of the singular indicates that one of them was at first the principal speaker. Perhaps one hastened home with the news before the rest. The sons of the prophet are not to be confounded with "the sons (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, disciples) of the <span class="accented">prophets"</span> (<a href="/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3, 4</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>); not merely because "the latter would scarcely have witnessed the golden calf worship" (Bahr), but also because they would have been differently designated] <span class="cmt_word">came and told him all the works</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">work</span>] <span class="cmt_word">that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they</span> [observe the plural] <span class="cmt_word">told also to their father.</span> [It is quite clear that the virtual excommunication which the man of God had pronounced had made as great an impression as the signs which he had showed. The interdict was a matter which came home to the Bethelites, as an affront to the whole community.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/13-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now a certain</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">old</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1511;&#1461;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;q&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2205.htm">Strong's 2205: </a> </span><span class="str2">Old</span><br /><br /><span class="word">prophet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
