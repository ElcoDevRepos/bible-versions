The use of cedar in the temple construction signifies the importance and sacredness of the building. Cedar was imported from Lebanon, as mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>, indicating the extensive trade networks and the wealth of Solomon's kingdom. The choice of cedar also reflects the grandeur and splendor intended for the house of God, aligning with the divine instructions given to Solomon's father, David, in <a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11-19</a>.<p><b>from the floor of the temple to the ceiling</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the complete coverage of the temple's interior with cedar, creating a unified and majestic appearance. The temple's design was meant to reflect the glory of God and serve as a physical representation of His presence among His people. The thoroughness of the paneling from floor to ceiling symbolizes the all-encompassing nature of God's holiness and the comprehensive dedication required in worship. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the fulfillment of the temple, embodying the fullness of God (<a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>).<p><b>and he covered the floor with cypress boards</b><br>Cypress wood, like cedar, was known for its durability and pleasant scent. The use of cypress for the flooring indicates a practical yet beautiful choice, ensuring the temple's longevity and aesthetic appeal. The distinction between the cedar walls and cypress floors may symbolize the diversity and richness of God's creation, as well as the different roles and functions within the body of Christ, the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).
