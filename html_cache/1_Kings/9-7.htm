The land was a divine gift, promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). However, the retention of this land was contingent upon Israel's obedience to God's commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63-64</a>). The concept of being "cut off" implies a severe judgment, often associated with exile or destruction, as seen in the Babylonian captivity (<a href="/2_kings/25-21.htm">2 Kings 25:21</a>). This serves as a warning that the privileges of the covenant come with responsibilities.<p><b>and I will banish from My presence this temple I have sanctified for My Name</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the central place of worship and symbolized God's presence among His people (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). Sanctification for God's Name indicates that the temple was set apart for His glory and worship. The threat of banishment from God's presence underscores the seriousness of Israel's potential disobedience. This foreshadows the destruction of the temple by the Babylonians in 586 BC (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>), illustrating the consequences of forsaking the covenant. The temple's destruction also prefigures the ultimate temple, Jesus Christ, who spoke of His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<p><b>Then Israel will become an object of scorn and ridicule among all peoples</b><br>This phrase reflects the shame and dishonor that would come upon Israel as a result of their disobedience. Being an object of scorn and ridicule among nations was a reversal of their intended role as a light to the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). Historically, this was fulfilled during the exiles, when Israel was mocked by surrounding nations (<a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15-16</a>). This serves as a reminder of the importance of faithfulness to God, as the nation's reputation and witness were at stake. The ridicule also points to the suffering servant motif, ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who was despised and rejected (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

(See <a href="/context/jeremiah/7-12.htm" title="But go you now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.">Jeremiah 7:12-14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/24-9.htm" title="And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them.">Jeremiah 24:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm" title="Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, said the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.">Jeremiah 25:9</a>.) The destruction of the Temple is by him compared with that which fell on Shiloh--no doubt, after the great defeat by the Philistines in the time of Eli (1 Samuel 4, 5), although the history gives no record of it. The continued existence of the people, as a people, to be "a proverb and a byword," through the Babylonish captivity, and through their present dispersion, is a fact to which the history of the world undoubtedly furnishes no parallel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them</span> [Cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-26.htm">Deuteronomy 4:26, 27</a>; and for the fulfilment see <a href="/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11, 21</a>;] <span class="cmt_word">and this house which I have hallowed for my name</span> [<a href="/jeremiah/7-14.htm">Jeremiah 7:14</a>] <span class="cmt_word">will I cast out of my sight</span> [same expression, <a href="/2_kings/24-20.htm">2 Kings 24:20</a>]; <span class="cmt_word">and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people</span> [the exact words of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>.
