Gold, being a precious and incorruptible metal, symbolizes purity and the glory of God. This act of overlaying the temple with gold reflects the wealth and resources available during Solomon's reign, a period of peace and prosperity in Israel's history. The opulence of the temple also points to the reverence and honor due to God, as seen in other parts of Scripture where gold is associated with divine presence, such as the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10-11</a>).<p><b>and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary</b><br>The gold chains served both a decorative and symbolic purpose. They marked the boundary of the Most Holy Place, the inner sanctuary where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. This area was considered the most sacred part of the temple, representing God's throne on earth. The use of gold chains can be seen as a reminder of the separation between the holy and the common, emphasizing the need for purity and reverence when approaching God. This separation is echoed in the New Testament, where the veil of the temple is torn at Christ's crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), symbolizing direct access to God through Jesus.<p><b>which was overlaid with gold</b><br>The repetition of gold overlay in the description underscores the temple's magnificence and the importance of the inner sanctuary. The Most Holy Place, being entirely overlaid with gold, highlights its significance as the dwelling place of God's presence. This lavish use of gold can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the ultimate temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), embodying the fullness of God's presence and glory.

Its incorruptible nature mirrors God&#8217;s own holiness (<a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Covering the &#8220;inside&#8221; stresses that every part of God&#8217;s house&#8212;seen or unseen&#8212;was to reflect His glory (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The lavish use of gold also fulfills God&#8217;s earlier instructions for His dwelling places, from the tabernacle to the temple, showing continuity in worship (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34&#8211;38</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;gold chains&#8221; served as an ornamental boundary, marking off the Most Holy Place (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-16.htm">2 Chronicles 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; By highlighting the separation, they emphasized God&#8217;s unapproachable holiness under the old covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The chains declared that access to God required both reverence and a mediator&#8212;anticipating the perfect mediation of Christ (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which was overlaid with gold</b><p>&#8226; Even the inner sanctuary&#8212;the Holy of Holies&#8212;received total gold covering (<a href="/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33-34</a>).<p>&#8226; This repetition underscores completeness: nothing in God&#8217;s immediate presence could lack the mark of perfection (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-7.htm">2 Chronicles 5:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; When Christ died and the temple veil tore (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), the golden-covered place once hidden became symbolically opened, revealing that His finished work grants believers direct access (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/6-21.htm">1 Kings 6:21</a> highlights Solomon&#8217;s meticulous use of gold to proclaim God&#8217;s unmatched holiness, the necessary separation between a holy God and sinful humanity, and the longing for a mediator to bridge that gap.

The LXX. and Vulg. have wholly different readings; but our translation appears to be substantially correct, and to signify either that Solomon made a chain-work decoration on the partition, or (perhaps more probably) that he made a golden chain to go across the entrance in the partition before the Oracle, in front of the veil, so as to be an additional guard against intrusion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">And</span>. The ornamentation of the holy place is next mentioned] <span class="cmt_word">Solomon overlaid</span> <span class="cmt_word">the house</span> [as well as the oracle] <span class="cmt_word">within</span> <span class="cmt_word">with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle</span> [These words are extremely obscure.

Bahr says, the boards of the cedar partition, just as the bars fastened together the boards of the tabornacle (<a href="/exodus/26-26.htm">Exodus 26:26-29</a>). Gesen. himself (together with Keil, marg., <span class="accented">al</span>.) understands the doors, "he bolted the doors of the oracle," so as to keep them closed, except on the day of atonement. But the literal rendering is, "he carried over with chains of gold before the oracle," where nothing is said of either boards or doors. The more natural interpretation, therefore, would perhaps be: he carried on the gold plates of the house in chains of gold across the partition, and so fastened it to the side walls. Perhaps this was done to avoid any fracture of, or insertion into, the stonework]; <span class="cmt_word">and he overlaid it</span> [What? Keil says, the cedar altar last mentioned at the end of ver. 20. But the altar has now dropped out of the reader's, and therefore presumably out of the writer's mind. It would be more natural to understand the words of the oracle just mentioned, but the adornment of the oracle has already been related (ver. 20), and it is hardly likely that having stated that it was covered with <span class="accented">pure gold</span> in one verse, he would mention that it was overlaid with <span class="accented">gold</span> in the next. It looks as if the cedar partition were referred to, the boards "before the oracle"] <span class="cmt_word">with gold.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/6-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Solomon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1465;&#1447;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;m&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8010.htm">Strong's 8010: </a> </span><span class="str2">Solomon -- David's son and successor to his throne</span><br /><br /><span class="word">overlaid</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1448;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7779;ap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
