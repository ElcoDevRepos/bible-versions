Their involvement here indicates a collective decision-making process, reflecting the communal nature of Israelite society. The inclusion of "the people" suggests a unified stance among the populace, emphasizing the importance of consensus in leadership decisions. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where leaders seek counsel from elders, such as Moses in <a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-27</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Do not listen to him</b><br>This phrase reflects a rejection of the demands made by Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram. The refusal to listen signifies a stand against oppression and unjust demands, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible. It echoes the resistance shown by the Israelites against Pharaoh in Exodus, where they refused to submit to tyranny. This decision is rooted in a trust in God's protection and provision, as seen in other biblical narratives where God's people are called to stand firm against external threats.<p><b>or consent to his terms.&#8221;</b><br>The terms likely refer to the oppressive conditions imposed by Ben-Hadad, which would have included surrendering wealth and possibly people. The refusal to consent highlights a commitment to sovereignty and faith in divine intervention. This mirrors the biblical principle of not compromising with evil, as seen in <a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>, which encourages believers to resist the devil. The decision to reject these terms can also be seen as an act of faith, trusting that God would deliver them from their enemies, similar to the deliverance narratives found in the book of Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The King of Israel during this time, known for his weak leadership and idolatry, often influenced by his wife Jezebel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-Hadad</a></b><br>The King of Aram (Syria), who besieged Samaria and demanded tribute from Ahab.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_israel.htm">Elders of Israel</a></b><br>The leaders and advisors in Israel who counseled Ahab against yielding to Ben-Hadad's demands.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, where this event takes place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_siege.htm">The Siege</a></b><br>Ben-Hadad's military action against Samaria, which sets the stage for the confrontation and counsel given to Ahab.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_godly_counsel.htm">The Importance of Godly Counsel</a></b><br>Seeking advice from wise and godly individuals can provide clarity and direction, especially in times of crisis.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_to_stand_firm.htm">Courage to Stand Firm</a></b><br>Ahab's initial response to Ben-Hadad's demands shows the need for courage and conviction in the face of intimidation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_leadership.htm">Discernment in Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders must discern between wise counsel and pressure to conform to ungodly demands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_support.htm">Community Support</a></b><br>The role of the community, represented by the elders, is crucial in supporting leaders to make righteous decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite the threat, trusting in God's plan and provision is essential for overcoming fear and making righteous decisions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_20_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 20:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_20_8_Value_of_wise_counsel.htm">How does 1 Kings 20:8 demonstrate the importance of seeking wise counsel?
