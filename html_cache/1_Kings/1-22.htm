The events in <a href="/1_kings/1.htm">1 Kings 1</a> occur during a critical transition period in Israel's monarchy. The phrase underscores the providential nature of the unfolding events, as God orchestrates the circumstances to ensure His chosen king, Solomon, ascends to the throne.<p><b>while Bathsheba was still speaking with the king</b><br>Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon, is advocating for her son's right to the throne. Her presence before King David highlights her influential role in the royal court. This moment reflects the cultural practice of a queen mother having significant sway in political matters. Bathsheba's advocacy is crucial, as it aligns with God's promise to David regarding Solomon's kingship (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>).<p><b>Nathan the prophet arrived</b><br>Nathan is a key prophetic figure in David's reign, known for his role in confronting David about his sin with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 12). His arrival at this moment is significant, as prophets were seen as God's mouthpieces, providing divine guidance and correction. Nathan's involvement underscores the legitimacy of Solomon's claim to the throne, as he acts in accordance with God's will. This event also prefigures the role of prophets in affirming God's chosen leaders, a theme seen throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The mother of Solomon, who was speaking to King David to ensure her son Solomon's succession to the throne, as David had promised.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The aging king of Israel, who had promised Bathsheba that her son Solomon would succeed him as king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>A trusted prophet and advisor to King David, who played a crucial role in ensuring Solomon's succession to the throne.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where these events took place, and the center of political and religious life in the kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>David's son, who was attempting to usurp the throne by declaring himself king without David's approval.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_godly_counsel.htm">The Importance of Godly Counsel</a></b><br>Nathan's timely arrival underscores the value of having wise and godly advisors who can provide guidance and support in critical moments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god's_promises.htm">Faithfulness to God's Promises</a></b><br>Bathsheba's appeal to David and Nathan's involvement highlight the importance of holding onto God's promises and working towards their fulfillment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophets.htm">The Role of Prophets</a></b><br>Nathan's role as a prophet demonstrates the importance of prophetic voices in guiding and correcting leaders according to God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_advocacy.htm">Courage in Advocacy</a></b><br>Bathsheba's boldness in approaching the king serves as an example of courage and advocacy for what is right, even in the face of potential opposition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_timing.htm">Divine Timing</a></b><br>Nathan's arrival "while she was still speaking" illustrates God's perfect timing in orchestrating events for His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_1_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 1:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Nathan_s_leadership_in_1_Kings_1_22.htm">How does Nathan's intervention in 1 Kings 1:22 demonstrate godly leadership principles?

Scripture often highlights such &#8220;coincidences&#8221; to show the invisible hand of the Lord; for example, &#8220;Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/24-15.htm">Genesis 24:15</a>) and &#8220;While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44</a>).<p>&#8226; Here the Lord moves events forward at the exact second needed to safeguard David&#8217;s succession plan and thwart Adonijah&#8217;s coup (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; This timing comforts believers today: the same Sovereign orchestrates the minutes and seconds of our lives (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>while Bathsheba was still speaking with the king</b><p>&#8226; Bathsheba is interceding for Solomon as Nathan instructed (<a href="/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11&#8211;14</a>). Her words echo God&#8217;s earlier promise that Solomon would be heir (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene models the biblical principle of &#8220;two or three witnesses&#8221; confirming a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a>). Bathsheba and Nathan arrive back-to-back to verify the crisis.<p>&#8226; David, though aged and frail (<a href="/1_kings/1-1.htm">1 Kings 1:1&#8211;4</a>), receives testimony in real time; the overlap underscores urgency and prevents any private manipulation of the king.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nathan the prophet arrived</b><p>&#8226; Nathan had once confronted David over sin (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1&#8211;14</a>) and later delivered the covenant promise that David&#8217;s throne would endure (<a href="/2_samuel/7-4.htm">2 Samuel 7:4&#8211;17</a>). His arrival now reminds readers that prophetic counsel, not human scheming, guides the royal line (<a href="/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; God sends a trusted prophet, not a soldier, underscoring that the kingdom rests on His word. Compare Elijah&#8217;s sudden entrance before Ahab&#8212;&#8220;As surely as the LORD lives&#8230; there will be neither dew nor rain&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Nathan&#8217;s appearance also signals to Bathsheba that she is not standing alone; God provides partnership to the faithful (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/1-22.htm">1 Kings 1:22</a> captures a divinely choreographed moment: Bathsheba pleads, the prophet steps through the doorway, and the aging king hears corroborating voices before he can even respond. The verse showcases God&#8217;s perfect timing, the power of united testimony, and the steady reliability of prophetic truth&#8212;assuring us that the Lord actively guards His promises and moves history right on schedule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</span> [Hebrews <span class="accented">cam, i.e.</span>, to the palace.

It is difficult to see how otherwise he could be announced. It is clear that he was constantly spoken of as "the prophet" (vers. 10, 22, 34, 38, etc. Cf. <a href="/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>]. <span class="cmt_word">And when he was come in before</span> [Hebrews <span class="accented">and he came before</span> - three words instead of six] <span class="cmt_word">the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground</span> [see on vers. 16, 20; and cf. ver. 31, where we have a similar expression. "In the Assyrian sculptures, ambassadors are represented with their faces actually touching the earth before the feet of the monarch" (Rawlinson).
