The cedar of Lebanon was renowned for its size, strength, and durability, often used in the construction of temples and palaces, including Solomon's own temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9-10</a>). This symbolizes strength and grandeur. In contrast, hyssop, a small plant growing in walls, was used in purification rituals (<a href="/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22</a>, <a href="/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4-6</a>), symbolizing humility and cleansing. This range from cedar to hyssop illustrates the breadth of Solomon's wisdom, covering both the grand and the modest aspects of creation, reflecting the comprehensive nature of divine wisdom.<p><b>and he taught about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish</b><br>Solomon's teachings extended to all categories of living creatures, indicating a deep understanding of the natural world. This knowledge reflects the dominion mandate given to humanity in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where humans are called to steward and understand creation. The mention of animals, birds, reptiles, and fish suggests a taxonomy that encompasses all life forms, similar to the categories found in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. Solomon's wisdom in these areas prefigures the perfect knowledge of Christ, who is described as the one in whom "are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>).

Solomon&#8217;s mention bridges the physical and the spiritual: even the smallest plant can carry redemptive meaning.<p>&#8226; The sweep &#8220;from&#8230;to&#8221; stresses that no detail in creation is beneath God&#8217;s attention (<a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29-31</a>).

Solomon&#8217;s earlier observations paved the way for such lessons.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/3-7.htm">James 3:7</a> notes that every kind of beast, bird, reptile, and sea creature has been tamed, echoing Solomon&#8217;s survey and underscoring humanity&#8217;s distinct place in God&#8217;s order.<p>&#8226; The comprehensive catalog in <a href="/1_kings/4-33.htm">1 Kings 4:33</a> therefore showcases how divine wisdom brings understanding of the whole created world, reinforcing <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>&#8212;that God&#8217;s invisible qualities are clearly seen in what He has made.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/4-33.htm">1 Kings 4:33</a> illustrates the vast scope of Solomon&#8217;s God-given wisdom. From the mightiest cedar to the humblest hyssop, and across animals, birds, reptiles, and fish, Solomon studied and taught all creation, revealing that true wisdom recognizes the Creator&#8217;s handiwork everywhere. His example invites believers to observe the natural world, draw spiritual insights, and honor the Lord who designed it all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">He spake of trees.</span>--Of this verse there have been many interpretations. Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii. </span>c.<span class= "ital">2</span>, ? 5) supposes Solomon's utterances on these natural products to have been allegorical and symbolic, although he declares that he described them and their properties "like a philosopher." Rabbinical and Oriental legends, eagerly accepted in mediaeval times, ascribed to him mystic knowledge and magical use of their occult properties. Modern writers have seen in this utterance the first dawn of a scientific natural history and idyllic poetry. In all these suppositions there is some truth, though each in its literal meaning evidently interprets the work of Solomon by the ideas of its own time. An examination of the Song of Songs, and even of the Book of Proverbs--to say nothing of Ecclesiastes and several of the Psalms, and of the Book of Job, which has been thought to belong to the age of Solomon--shows in them repeated exemplifications of a deep sense of the wonder and the beauty of Nature, and also a keen observation of Natural history in detail But it also shows, as might have been expected, a constant contemplation of God in and over Nature (much as in Psalms 104), a desire to know the secret of His dispensation therein, a conception of a unity in His law over all being, and as a necessary consequence of this, a tendency to mystic interpretation and parable. If in the works here referred to, and now lost to us, there were (as Ewald supposes) "the rudiments of a complete natural history," it would be an anachronism to doubt that they were marked by these leading characteristics.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">he spare of</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, discoursed, treated, not necessarily wrote] <span class="cmt_word">trees</span> [In his proverbs and songs he exceeded the children of the East.

The Jews had a profound admiration for all trees, and of these they justly regarded the cedar as king. Cf. <a href="/judges/9-15.htm">Judges 9:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-10.htm">Psalm 80:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-16.htm">Psalm 104:16</a>; <a href="/songs/5-15.htm">Song of Solomon 5:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>] <span class="cmt_word">unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall</span> [His knowledge, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, embraced the least productions of nature as well as the greatest. The common hyssop (<a href="/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22</a>; <a href="/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4</a>) can hardly be intended here, as that often attains a considerable height (two feet), but a miniature variety or moss like hyssop in appearance, probably <span class="accented">Orthotrichura saxatile</span>]: <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.</span> ["The usual Biblical division of the animal kingdom" (Rawlinson). The arrangment is hardly according to manner of motion (Bahr). If anything, it is according to elements - earth, sky, sea. Both Jewish and Mohammedan writers abound in exaggerated or purely fabulous accounts of Solomon's attainments and gifts. We may see the beginning of these in Jos., Ant. 8:02.5. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/4-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He spoke</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
