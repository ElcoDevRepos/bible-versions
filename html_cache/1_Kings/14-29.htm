His reign is marked by the division of Israel into two kingdoms, which was a significant turning point in Israelite history. The "rest of the acts" suggests that there were additional deeds and events during his reign that are not detailed in this particular biblical account. This phrase indicates that the biblical narrative is selective, focusing on events with theological significance rather than providing a comprehensive historical record.<p><b>along with all that he did</b><br>This phrase implies that Rehoboam's reign included various activities and decisions, both political and religious. His reign was characterized by conflict with the northern kingdom of Israel, led by Jeroboam, and internal strife within Judah. Rehoboam's actions, such as his initial harsh policies and later attempts at fortification and defense, reflect the challenges of maintaining a divided kingdom. His reign also saw the introduction of idolatrous practices, which were condemned by the prophets and contributed to the spiritual decline of Judah.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><br>This rhetorical question points to an external source, the "Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah," which is not part of the biblical canon but was likely a historical record kept by the royal scribes. This book would have contained detailed accounts of the reigns of the kings of Judah, serving as a historical archive. The mention of this book underscores the historical reality of the events described and suggests that the biblical authors had access to other sources when compiling their narratives. It also highlights the practice of record-keeping in the ancient Near East, where annals and chronicles were common for documenting the reigns of kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, whose reign was marked by division and conflict.

The inspired author signals that what has been recorded so far&#8212;Rehoboam&#8217;s early blunders, the split of the kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/12-1.htm">1 Kings 12:1-24</a>), the apostasy he tolerated (<a href="/1_kings/14-22.htm">1 Kings 14:22-24</a>), and Egypt&#8217;s invasion (<a href="/1_kings/14-25.htm">1 Kings 14:25-28</a>)&#8212;is only a sampling. God wants us to know Rehoboam&#8217;s story is larger than one or two incidents. Other portions of Scripture confirm this breadth: <a href="/bsb/2_chronicles/11.htm">2 Chronicles 11&#8211;12</a> fills in more details about his fortified cities, family decisions, and late-in-life repentance. Together they reveal a life marked by:<p>&#8226; Initial hardness, yet eventual humility (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-6.htm">2 Chronicles 12:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Mixed leadership outcomes&#8212;fortifying Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5-12</a>) while allowing idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; The unvarnished honesty of Scripture in recording both victory and failure, just as it does for David (<a href="/1_kings/15-5.htm">1 Kings 15:5</a>) or Asa (<a href="/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with all that he did</b><p>This clause widens the lens to every sphere of Rehoboam&#8217;s activity. The Lord&#8217;s record-keeping embraces:<p>&#8226; Domestic affairs&#8212;his eighteen wives and sixty concubines, demonstrating lack of restraint (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Military efforts&#8212;strategic garrisons that temporarily strengthened Judah&#8217;s borders (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Economic realities&#8212;the loss of Solomon&#8217;s gold shields replaced by bronze, symbolizing diminished glory (<a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26-27</a>).<p>By noting &#8220;all that he did,&#8221; Scripture reminds us no deed lies outside God&#8217;s observation (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). The chronicling of kings underscores personal accountability before the righteous Judge (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><p>This rhetorical question points readers to an official royal archive, much like references to the &#8220;Book of the Acts of Solomon&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-41.htm">1 Kings 11:41</a>) or the &#8220;Book of the Kings of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/14-19.htm">1 Kings 14:19</a>). Three truths emerge:<p>&#8226; Historical reliability: The biblical author confidently cites contemporary records, inviting verification (cf. <a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1-4</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Selective inspiration: God chose what serves His redemptive purposes, not every detail from the royal annals (<a href="/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Covenant continuity: By tracking Judah&#8217;s kings, Scripture traces the lineage that leads to Christ (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-6.htm">Matthew 1:6-7</a>), even through flawed rulers like Rehoboam.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/14-29.htm">1 Kings 14:29</a> serves as a divinely placed signpost. It assures us that Rehoboam&#8217;s recorded failures and fleeting reforms are only part of a fully documented reign, proving God&#8217;s exhaustive knowledge of human history. The verse also testifies to Scripture&#8217;s trustworthiness, its purposeful selectivity, and its unwavering focus on the covenant line. While Rehoboam&#8217;s legacy is mixed, God&#8217;s faithful chronicling calls every reader to remember that our own &#8220;acts&#8221; are likewise known and will be weighed by the same righteous King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">The chronicles of the kings of Judah.</span>--In <a href="/2_chronicles/12-15.htm" title="Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies?
