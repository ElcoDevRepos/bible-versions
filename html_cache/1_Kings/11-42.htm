His reign is often seen as the zenith of Israel's united monarchy. Solomon's wisdom and wealth were renowned, and his rule is frequently referenced in biblical literature as a time of great achievement and divine favor. However, his later years were marred by idolatry and political alliances that led to spiritual decline.<p><b>in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem was the political and spiritual center of Israel during Solomon's reign. It was here that Solomon built the Temple, which became the focal point of Jewish worship. The city holds a central place in biblical history, serving as the capital of the united kingdom under David and Solomon. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of a significant urban center in Jerusalem during this period, aligning with biblical accounts.<p><b>over all Israel</b><br>Solomon's rule extended over the entire nation of Israel, which included the twelve tribes. This unity was a continuation of the consolidation achieved by his father, David. The phrase "over all Israel" emphasizes the extent of Solomon's authority and the unity of the nation during his reign. This unity would later fracture after Solomon's death, leading to the division into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah.<p><b>was forty years</b><br>The duration of Solomon's reign, forty years, is symbolic in biblical literature, often representing a period of testing, trial, or completeness. This time frame is consistent with the reigns of other significant biblical figures, such as David and Saul, who also reigned for forty years. The number forty is frequently used in the Bible to denote a generation or a significant period of time, underscoring the completeness and significance of Solomon's rule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.

They listened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.">1Kings 12:24</a>, runs as follows :--<p>"And there was a man of Mount Ephraim, a servant of Solomon, and his name was Jeroboam; and his mother's name was Sarira, a woman who was a harlot. And Solomon made him taskmaster [literally, "master of the staff," or "scourge"] over the burdens [forced labours] of the house of Joseph; and he built for Solomon Sarira, which is in Mount Ephraim; and he had three hundred chariots. He it was who built the citadel [the "Millo"], by the labours of the house of Ephraim, and completed the fortification of the city of David. And he was exalting himself to seek the kingdom. And Solomon sought to put him to death; so he feared, and stole away to Sousakim [Shishak], king of Egypt, and was with him till the death of Solomon. And Jeroboam heard in Egypt that Solomon was dead, and he spake in the ears of Sousakim, king of Egypt, saying, Send me away, and I will go back to my own land. And Sousakim said to him, Ask of me a request, and I will give it thee. And he gave to Jeroboam Ano, the elder sister of his own wife Thekemina [Tahpenes] to be his wife. She was great among the daughters of the king, and bare to Jeroboam Abias [Abijah] his son. And Jeroboam said to Sousakim, Send me really away, and I will go back. And Jeroboam went forth from Egypt, and came to the land of Sarira, in Mount Ephraim, and there gathered together to him the whole strength of Ephraim. And Jeroboam built there a fortress."<p>Then follows, with variations of detail, the story of the sickness of Abijah, the visit of Jeroboam's wife to Ahijah, and the message of judgment; corresponding to <a href="/context/1_kings/14-1.htm" title="At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.">1Kings 14:1-18</a>. The narrative then continues thus:--<p>" And Jeroboam went his way to Shechem, in Mount Ephraim, and gathered together there the tribes of Israel; and Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, went up there. And the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, the Enlamite, saying. Take to thyself a new garment, which has never been in water, and tear it in ten pieces; and thou shalt give them to Jeroboam, and shalt say to him, Take thee ten pieces, to clothe thyself therewith. And Jeroboam took them; and Shemaiah said, These things saith the Lord, signifying the ten tribes of Israel."<p>The whole concludes with an account, given with some characteristic variations, of the remonstrance with Rehoboam, the rebellion, and the prohibition by Shemaiah of the intended attack of Rehoboam, corresponding to <a href="/context/1_kings/12-1.htm" title="And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.">1Kings 12:1-24</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the time</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">days</span>] that <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</span> [Josephus, here as elsewhere, doubles the figure, making his reign to have lasted <span class="accented">eighty</span> years.
