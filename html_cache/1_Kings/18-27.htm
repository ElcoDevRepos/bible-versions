The timing, "at noon," is crucial as it is the peak time for the sun god Baal to demonstrate his power. Elijah's taunting is a bold move, highlighting his confidence in the LORD and his disdain for idolatry. This moment underscores the spiritual battle between the worship of Yahweh and the pagan practices that had infiltrated Israel under King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Shout louder, for he is a god!</b><br>Elijah's sarcasm serves to mock the impotence of Baal, contrasting the living God of Israel with the false gods. This reflects the biblical theme of the futility of idol worship, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, which describe idols as having mouths but not speaking. Elijah's challenge is a call to recognize the true God who hears and responds to His people.<p><b>Perhaps he is deep in thought,</b><br>This phrase suggests that Baal might be preoccupied, highlighting the absurdity of a god who is not omniscient. In contrast, the God of Israel is all-knowing, as affirmed in <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>. Elijah's words expose the limitations of Baal and emphasize the superiority of Yahweh, who is never too busy to attend to His people.<p><b>or occupied,</b><br>The suggestion that Baal might be "occupied" implies that he is engaged in activities that prevent him from responding. This mocks the idea of a god who is not omnipresent. The God of Israel, however, is always present and attentive, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a>, which speaks of God's omnipresence.<p><b>or on a journey.</b><br>Elijah's taunt that Baal might be "on a journey" further ridicules the notion of a god who is not always accessible. This contrasts with the God of Israel, who is always near to those who call on Him, as stated in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>. The idea of a god who travels is foreign to the biblical understanding of God, who is sovereign over all creation.<p><b>Perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened!&#8221;</b><br>The final taunt suggests that Baal might be asleep, a direct affront to the idea of a vigilant deity. This is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3-4</a>, which assures that the God of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps. Elijah's mockery serves to demonstrate the impotence of Baal and the power of the true God, who is always active and engaged in the lives of His people. This moment foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over falsehood, a theme fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who triumphs over all spiritual powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of the Lord, known for his boldness and faithfulness in confronting the prophets of Baal and demonstrating the power of the true God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_of_baal.htm">Prophets of Baal</a></b><br>Pagan prophets serving Baal, a false god, who were challenged by Elijah on Mount Carmel to prove the power of their deity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_carmel.htm">Mount Carmel</a></b><br>The location of the dramatic confrontation between Elijah and the prophets of Baal, symbolizing a place of decision and divine intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal.htm">Baal</a></b><br>A Canaanite deity worshiped by many in Israel during this time, representing idolatry and false worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation witnessing this confrontation, called to return to the worship of the one true God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idols, whether ancient or modern, cannot respond or provide for our needs.

By contrasting Baal&#8217;s silence with God&#8217;s swift, fiery answer, the text invites us to abandon powerless substitutes and trust the living God who always hears and acts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Elijah mocked them.</span>--The mockery of Elijah--apparently even blunter and more scornful in the sense of the original--has been with over-ingenuity explained as applying to various supposed actions of Baal. It is merely the bitter irony of sheer contempt, calling Baal a god only to heap upon him ideas most ungodlike; "He is busy, or he is in retirement; he is far away, or in the noon-day heat he is asleep." Characteristic of the fierce indignation of Elijah's nature, in this crisis of conflict, it is yet not unlike the righteous scorn of the psalmists or the prophets (see <a href="/context/psalms/115-4.htm" title="Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.">Psalm 115:4-8</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/135-15.htm" title="The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.">Psalm 135:15-18</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/44-9.htm" title="They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/46-1.htm" title="Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols were on the beasts, and on the cattle: your carriages were heavy laden; they are a burden to the weary beast.">Isaiah 46:1-7</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/10-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.">Jeremiah 10:2-10</a>, &c.) for the worship of "the vanities" of the heathen. There was no place for toleration of prejudice, or tender appreciation of a blind worship feeling after God, like that of St. Paul at Athens (<a href="/context/acts/17-22.htm" title="Then Paul stood in the middle of Mars' hill, and said, You men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.">Acts 17:22-23</a>).
