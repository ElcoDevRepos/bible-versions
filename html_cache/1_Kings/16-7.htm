Jehu, son of Hanani, is a lesser-known prophet, but his role is significant in delivering God's judgment. Prophets often served as intermediaries between God and the people, conveying messages of warning, judgment, or hope. The mention of Jehu connects to the broader prophetic tradition in Israel, where prophets like Elijah and Elisha played crucial roles. Hanani, Jehu's father, was also a prophet, suggesting a family legacy of prophetic ministry (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-10</a>).<p><b>against Baasha and his house</b><br>Baasha was the king of Israel who came to power by assassinating Nadab, the son of Jeroboam. His reign is marked by idolatry and sin, similar to the house of Jeroboam. The phrase "against Baasha and his house" indicates a divine judgment not only on Baasha but also on his dynasty, reflecting the biblical principle that the consequences of sin can extend to one's descendants. This judgment is consistent with God's dealings with other sinful dynasties in Israel's history.<p><b>because of all the evil he had done in the sight of the LORD</b><br>This phrase highlights the moral and spiritual evaluation of Baasha's actions. "In the sight of the LORD" underscores God's omniscience and His role as the ultimate judge of human behavior. The evil mentioned likely includes idolatry, injustice, and other violations of the covenant with God. This evaluation aligns with the Deuteronomic history's emphasis on covenant faithfulness and the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands</b><br>The "work of his hands" refers to Baasha's actions, particularly his idolatrous practices and possibly his political maneuvers. Provoking God to anger is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where idolatry and rebellion lead to divine wrath. This phrase serves as a warning about the seriousness of sin and its capacity to disrupt the relationship between God and His people.<p><b>and becoming like the house of Jeroboam</b><br>Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, set a precedent of idolatry by establishing golden calves at Bethel and Dan. Baasha's comparison to Jeroboam indicates that he perpetuated similar sins, leading Israel away from true worship. This comparison serves as a reminder of the dangers of following ungodly examples and the importance of faithfulness to God's commands.<p><b>and also because Baasha had struck down the house of Jeroboam</b><br>Baasha's rise to power involved the violent overthrow of Jeroboam's dynasty, fulfilling a prophecy against Jeroboam's house (<a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10-14</a>). However, Baasha's actions, though used by God to fulfill prophecy, were still subject to divine judgment due to his motives and subsequent sins. This reflects the complex interplay between divine sovereignty and human responsibility in biblical narratives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu_son_of_hanani.htm">Jehu son of Hanani</a></b><br>A prophet of the LORD who delivered God's message of judgment to Baasha.

Keil and Bahr hold that it is designed to guard against a perversion of ver. 2, "I made thee prince," etc., from which it might be inferred that he was commissioned of God to murder Nadab. But it is simpler to suppose that his primary idea was to convey, by this repetition, which no doubt is derived from a different source from the statement of ver. 2, that Baasha was visited <span class="accented">by God</span> for his various sins.
