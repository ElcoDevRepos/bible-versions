The man of God is a prophet from Judah, the southern kingdom. This encounter highlights the division between the northern and southern kingdoms after the reign of Solomon. The old prophet's cry signifies a divine message, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation. Prophets often served as God's mouthpieces, delivering messages of warning or judgment. The geographical context of Judah and Bethel underscores the political and spiritual tensions of the time, as Jeroboam, king of Israel, had established Bethel as a center of idolatrous worship.<p><b>&#8220;This is what the LORD says:</b><br>This phrase introduces a direct message from God, a common prophetic formula indicating divine authority. It underscores the role of prophets as intermediaries between God and His people. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, reminding the audience of God's sovereignty and the importance of obedience to His commands.<p><b>&#8216;Because you have defied the word of the LORD</b><br>Defying the word of the LORD implies a serious breach of divine command. In the biblical context, obedience to God's word was paramount, and defiance often led to severe consequences. This phrase highlights the gravity of the man of God's actions, as he had been explicitly instructed by God not to eat or drink in Bethel. The narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of disobedience and the importance of adhering to God's instructions.<p><b>and have not kept the commandment that the LORD your God gave you,</b><br>The commandment refers to specific instructions given to the man of God, emphasizing personal responsibility in following God's directives. The phrase "the LORD your God" personalizes the relationship, reminding the man of God of his duty to remain faithful. This reflects the broader biblical theme of covenant faithfulness, where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience to God's laws. The failure to keep the commandment serves as a warning to all believers about the consequences of straying from God's path.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god_from_judah.htm">The Man of God from Judah</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God to deliver a message to King Jeroboam.

Even successes earlier in the day&#8212;Jeroboam&#8217;s withered hand restored (<a href="/1_kings/13-6.htm">1 Kings 13:6</a>)&#8212;cannot offset later disobedience.<p>&#8226; The warning connects to Jesus&#8217; teaching that hearing without doing is defiance that ends in ruin (<a href="/matthew/7-26.htm">Matthew 7:26&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And have not kept the commandment that the LORD your God gave you</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s commands are specific and personal: &#8220;You must not eat bread or drink water there&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/13-9.htm">1 Kings 13:9</a>). Selective obedience is still disobedience (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The title &#8220;the LORD your God&#8221; personalizes the relationship, echoing covenant language in <a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>.

Believers are urged to guard both doctrine and conduct (<a href="/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-17.htm">2 Peter 3:17</a>) lest they drift.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/13-21.htm">1 Kings 13:21</a> lays out heaven&#8217;s indictment: the man of God, though once obedient and empowered, chose to override God&#8217;s clear instruction. The verse teaches that divine calling does not exempt anyone from divine commands; authority rests with the LORD alone, and defying His word brings inevitable consequence. Staying alert, testing every voice by Scripture (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>), and practicing whole-hearted obedience safeguard God&#8217;s servants in every generation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">he cried</span> [same word as in ver. 2.
