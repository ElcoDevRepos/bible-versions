The "word of the LORD" signifies a direct revelation from God, a common theme in the Old Testament where prophets receive specific instructions. This underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and His people. The phrase also highlights the role of prophets as messengers who convey God's will, similar to Moses and Elijah, who also received direct commands from God.<p><b>You must not eat bread or drink water:</b><br>This command signifies a test of obedience and separation. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and agreement. By forbidding the man of God to eat or drink, God was instructing him to remain separate from the idolatrous practices of the Northern Kingdom under Jeroboam. This command can be seen as a type of fasting, a practice often associated with seeking God's favor or demonstrating repentance, as seen in the lives of Daniel and Jesus.<p><b>or return by the way you came.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The instruction not to return by the same route symbolizes a complete break from the past and a new direction in obedience to God. This can be seen as a metaphor for repentance, which involves turning away from sin and moving towards God. Theologically, it reflects the idea of transformation and renewal, themes that are echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, which speaks of being transformed by the renewing of the mind. The command also serves as a practical measure to avoid retracing steps that might lead to temptation or danger.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>A prophet from Judah sent by God to deliver a message to King Jeroboam in Bethel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_jeroboam.htm">King Jeroboam</a></b><br>The ruler of the northern kingdom of Israel who led the people into idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant religious site in Israel where Jeroboam set up a golden calf for worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_the_lord.htm">The Word of the LORD</a></b><br>The divine command given to the man of God, emphasizing obedience to God's instructions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_return_journey.htm">The Return Journey</a></b><br>The specific instruction not to return by the same route, symbolizing a complete break from the idolatrous practices encountered.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The man of God's mission underscores the importance of strict adherence to God's instructions, even when they seem inconvenient or difficult.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>The command not to eat or drink in Bethel serves as a warning against compromising with idolatrous practices or environments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_the_journey.htm">The Significance of the Journey</a></b><br>The instruction not to return by the same way symbolizes a call to transformation and a new path in obedience to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophets.htm">The Role of Prophets</a></b><br>Prophets are called to deliver God's message faithfully, regardless of personal cost or the response of their audience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The broader account of <a href="/bsb/1_kings/13.htm">1 Kings 13</a> illustrates the severe consequences that can follow when God's commands are not followed.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_13_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 13:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_couldn_t_prophet_eat_drink_in_1_Kings_13.htm">Why was the prophet instructed not to eat or drink in 1 Kings 13:9?

The prophet's refusal to participate was consequently a practical and forcible disclaimer of all fellowship, a virtual excommunication, a public repudiation of the calf worshippers. Cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>, "With such an one, no, not to eat." As Corn. a Lapide," <span class="accented">Ut ipso facto ostenderet, Bethelitas idololatras adeo esse detestabiles, et a Deo quasi excommunicates, ut nullum fidelium cum iis cibi vel potus communionem habere velit"</span>], nor turn again <span class="cmt_word">by the</span> same way that thou camest. [ the object of this command was not "simply to test the obedience of the prophet" (Rawlinson), nor yet that no one might "force him to a delay which was irreconcilable with his commission" (Keil), for that was practically executed, but to avoid as far as possible - what, indeed, happened in spite of these precautions - his being traced and followed. Because of this provision, the old prophet (ver. 10) was reduced to ask, "What way went he?" But the charge, we can hardly doubt,was also designed to serve another purpose, viz., to warn the prophet against doing what he did presently - against returning to Bethel. When he was followed, and when he was told of a revelation commanding his return, he should have remembered, among other things, that it had clearly been part of God's purpose, as evidenced by the explicit instructions given him, that he should not be followed. This alone should have led him to suspect this old prophet of deceit.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/13-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;
