The word "behold" is often used in Scripture to draw attention to something significant or surprising. In the context of <a href="/1_kings/1.htm">1 Kings 1</a>, the urgency is due to the political and dynastic implications of Adonijah's actions. The transition of power in ancient Israel was a critical moment, often fraught with tension and potential conflict.<p><b>Adonijah has become king,</b><br>Adonijah, the fourth son of King David, sought to establish himself as king despite not being the chosen successor. This act of self-exaltation mirrors the actions of Absalom, another of David's sons, who also attempted to usurp the throne. Adonijah's actions were contrary to God's plan, as Solomon was the divinely appointed successor (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>). This highlights the recurring biblical theme of human ambition conflicting with divine will.<p><b>and you, my lord the king,</b><br>The phrase "my lord the king" is a respectful address to King David, acknowledging his authority and position. It reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Israelite society, where the king was seen as God's anointed leader. This address also underscores the loyalty and respect Bathsheba and Nathan the prophet have for David, as they seek to inform him of the situation.<p><b>do not know it.</b><br>This indicates that King David, due to his advanced age and declining health, was unaware of Adonijah's actions. It suggests a lapse in communication and control within the royal court. The phrase also highlights the importance of vigilance and awareness in leadership. In a broader biblical context, it serves as a reminder of the need for spiritual discernment and the dangers of complacency.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The son of King David who attempts to usurp the throne without his father's knowledge or blessing.
