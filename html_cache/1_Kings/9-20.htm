These groups were part of the original inhabitants of Canaan, and their presence is documented throughout the Old Testament. The Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites were among the nations that God commanded the Israelites to drive out of the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). However, not all were expelled or destroyed, and some remained in the land, as seen in this passage. The presence of these groups highlights the incomplete obedience of the Israelites in fully conquering the land as God had instructed.<p><b>(the people who were not Israelites)</b><br>This parenthetical note emphasizes the distinction between the Israelites and the remaining Canaanite peoples. The Israelites were chosen by God to be His covenant people, set apart from other nations (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The continued presence of these non-Israelite groups in the land served as a test of Israel's faithfulness to God's commands and often led to spiritual and cultural challenges, as the Israelites were tempted to adopt the idolatrous practices of these peoples (<a href="/judges/2.htm">Judges 2:1-3</a>). This distinction also underscores the theme of separation and holiness that runs throughout the biblical narrative, where God's people are called to be distinct from the surrounding nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorites.htm">Amorites</a></b><br>A group of ancient people who lived in the land of Canaan before the Israelites.

Many of the dangers of the stormy age of the Judges were due to the uprising of these subject races; as in the revival of the northern confederacy at Hazor under Sisera (Judges 4), and the usurpation of Abimelech by aid of the Shecliemites (Judges 9). Probably their subordination to Israel varied according to the strength or weakness of each age; but, when the monarchy became organised under David and Solomon, it was fixed definitely and permanently, although, like the serfship of the Middle Ages, it might vary in its severity in different times and in different regions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites</span> [<a href="/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21-36</a>;
