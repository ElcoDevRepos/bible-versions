Saddling a donkey indicates preparation for a journey, suggesting a deliberate decision to disobey Solomon's command. In biblical times, donkeys were common means of transportation, symbolizing humility and service, contrasting with the royal horses of kings.<p><b>and set out to Achish at Gath</b><br>Achish was a Philistine king of Gath, a city known for its association with giants like Goliath. Gath was one of the five major Philistine cities, located in what is now modern-day Israel. Shimei's journey to Gath, a Philistine territory, highlights the tension between Israel and its neighbors. This act of leaving Israelite territory for a Philistine city underscores Shimei's disregard for Solomon's authority and the covenantal boundaries of the land.<p><b>in search of his slaves</b><br>The mention of slaves indicates the socio-economic practices of the time, where slavery was a common institution. Shimei's slaves had fled, prompting his journey. This reflects the broader biblical theme of servitude and freedom, echoing Israel's own history of slavery in Egypt and the subsequent Exodus. The pursuit of runaway slaves also illustrates the legal and social obligations of a master in ancient Israel.<p><b>and he brought them back from Gath</b><br>Shimei's successful retrieval of his slaves from Gath suggests a temporary triumph, yet it ultimately leads to his downfall. This act of returning with the slaves signifies a breach of Solomon's command, setting the stage for Shimei's punishment.

Compare <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>, where Abraham rose early and &#8220;saddled his donkey&#8221; before setting out, and <a href="/numbers/22-21.htm">Numbers 22:21</a>, where Balaam did the same.<p>&#8226; Shimei&#8217;s decision violates the clear restriction Solomon had laid down in <a href="/1_kings/2-36.htm">1 Kings 2:36-38</a>. He is literally preparing to cross the line that will cost him his life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and set out to Achish at Gath</b><p>&#8226; Gath was a Philistine stronghold (<a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/21-19.htm">2 Samuel 21:19</a>). Going there meant passing well beyond the Kidron Valley boundary Solomon had set (<a href="/1_kings/2-37.htm">1 Kings 2:37</a>).<p>&#8226; Achish is the same Philistine ruler with whom David had once taken refuge (<a href="/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10-15</a>; 27:1-3), underscoring how far Shimei travels&#8212;both geographically and spiritually&#8212;into enemy territory.<p>&#8226; By choosing Gath, Shimei shows practical distrust of Israel&#8217;s borders and, by extension, of Solomon&#8217;s God-given kingship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in search of his slaves</b><p>&#8226; The motive appears mundane: missing servants. Yet Scripture often exposes character through what a person pursues (<a href="/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Shimei elevates property above obedience. Contrast <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>, where the Law guards human dignity, and <a href="/deuteronomy/23-15.htm">Deuteronomy 23:15-16</a>, which forbids returning escaped slaves to harsh masters. Shimei&#8217;s frantic chase after servants highlights misplaced priorities.<p>&#8226; His determination to retrieve them demonstrates that he counted personal loss more serious than covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he brought them back from Gath</b><p>&#8226; Shimei &#8220;brought them back,&#8221; apparently successful&#8212;yet success achieved through disobedience is hollow (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment he re-enters Jerusalem, the outcome is sealed: Solomon learns of the trip (<a href="/1_kings/2-41.htm">1 Kings 2:41</a>), confronts him (v. 42), and ultimately orders his execution (v. 46).<p>&#8226; Shimei&#8217;s brief gain&#8212;two recovered slaves&#8212;cannot offset the life-and-death consequence foretold (<a href="/1_kings/2-37.htm">1 Kings 2:37</a>). The narrative spotlights the certainty of the king&#8217;s word and, ultimately, of God&#8217;s word (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/2-40.htm">1 Kings 2:40</a> records Shimei&#8217;s conscious, step-by-step violation of Solomon&#8217;s command. Each phrase shows him moving farther from obedience and closer to judgment: he prepares (saddles), departs (sets out), pursues personal interests (slaves), and returns with a fleeting victory that triggers his downfall. The verse teaches the literal certainty of God-backed authority and the futility of prioritizing temporal gain over covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Shimei arose and saddled his ass</span> [not necessarily himself. <span class="accented">Qui facit per alium, facit per se.</span> Matthew Henry thinks Shimei did it himself for the sake of secresy.
