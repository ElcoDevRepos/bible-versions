Maacah, the grandmother of Asa, was the daughter of Absalom and the wife of Rehoboam, making her a prominent figure in the royal lineage. Asa's decision to remove her from this position demonstrates his commitment to religious reform and his willingness to challenge familial ties for the sake of spiritual integrity. This act reflects the biblical principle of prioritizing obedience to God over familial loyalty, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>.<p><b>because she had made a detestable Asherah pole</b><br>Asherah poles were wooden symbols associated with the worship of the Canaanite goddess Asherah, often erected near altars dedicated to Baal. Such idolatrous practices were strictly forbidden in Israelite law (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21-22</a>) and were considered abominations. The presence of an Asherah pole indicates the syncretism and idolatry that had infiltrated Judah, which Asa sought to eradicate. This action aligns with the biblical theme of purging idolatry to maintain covenant faithfulness, as emphasized in the first and second commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-6</a>).<p><b>Asa chopped down the pole and burned it in the Kidron Valley</b><br>The Kidron Valley, located east of Jerusalem, served as a site for disposing of impurities and idolatrous objects (<a href="/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>). Asa's destruction of the Asherah pole by chopping and burning it signifies a complete and public renunciation of idolatry, ensuring that no remnants remained to tempt the people back into sin. This act of purification is reminiscent of the reforms of later kings like Josiah, who also destroyed idolatrous objects (<a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-15</a>). The burning of the pole symbolizes the total eradication of sin, akin to the purifying fire of God's judgment (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned for 41 years.

In the ancient Near East, the queen mother held great authority (cf. <a href="/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>; 2 Chron 22:3). By removing Maacah, Asa demonstrates that allegiance to the LORD outranks family ties&#8212;echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6-9</a>, which calls God&#8217;s people to deal decisively even with a close relative who leads others into idolatry.<p>&#8226; Asa&#8217;s courage mirrors Jesus&#8217; later call to place faithfulness above kinship (<a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>).<p>&#8226; Parallel account: &#8220;King Asa also removed Maacah his grandmother from her position as queen mother&#8230;&#8221; (2 Chron 15:16), confirming the historical detail.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because she had made a detestable Asherah pole</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Detestable&#8221; signals something abhorrent to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25-26</a>). Asherah poles were wooden symbols tied to the fertility goddess Asherah, often erected beside Baal altars (<a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>,16).<p>&#8226; Maacah&#8217;s idol was not a harmless family heirloom; it represented spiritual treason within the royal household. The first commandment forbids such worship (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming the sin, Scripture underscores that no position&#8212;even that of queen mother&#8212;grants immunity when God&#8217;s honor is at stake.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Asa chopped down the pole</b><p>&#8226; Asa goes beyond removing Maacah; he attacks the idol itself. This mirrors Moses grinding the golden calf to powder (<a href="/exodus/32-20.htm">Exodus 32:20</a>) and foreshadows Josiah&#8217;s later destruction of high-place idols (<a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The action is literal: wood is cut, splintered, and rendered useless. The text shows obedience carried out in tangible steps, in line with <a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>: &#8220;Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, and burn up their Asherah poles.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Asa&#8217;s zeal fulfills the pattern of covenant renewal seen throughout Israel&#8217;s history (<a href="/joshua/24-23.htm">Joshua 24:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and burned it in the Kidron Valley</b><p>&#8226; Burning the pole completes the purge. Fire eliminates the possibility of the idol&#8217;s restoration (<a href="/acts/19-19.htm">Acts 19:19</a> offers a New-Testament parallel when occult scrolls are burned).<p>&#8226; The Kidron Valley, east of Jerusalem, often served as a dumping ground for defilement (<a href="/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>,12; 2 Chron 29:16). By casting the remains there, Asa publicly declares the pole&#8217;s uncleanness.<p>&#8226; The location also foreshadows Christ crossing the Kidron on His way to Gethsemane (<a href="/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>), subtly reminding us that ultimate cleansing from idolatry would come through the Messiah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a> records a king who chooses covenant faithfulness over family loyalty, dismantles a powerful woman&#8217;s influence, destroys an object of pagan worship, and consigns its ashes to a valley associated with impurity. The verse models uncompromising devotion: identify the sin, remove the influence, destroy the idol, and banish its memory&#8212;all for the glory of the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">An idol in a grove.</span>--The original word for "idol"--peculiar to this passage and its parallel (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-16.htm" title="And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.">2Chronicles 15:16</a>)--appears to signify a "horrible abomination" of some monstrous kind; and instead of "in a grove," we should read "for an asherah," the wooden emblem of the Canaanitish deity (on which see <a href="/1_kings/14-22.htm" title="And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.">1Kings 14:22</a>). There seems little doubt that some obscene emblem is meant, of the kind so often connected with worship of the productive powers of nature in ancient religions, substituted as a still greater abomination for the ordinary asherah. Clearly the act of Maachah was one of so flagrant a kind, that Asa took the unusual step, on which the historian here lays great stress, of degrading her in her old age from her high dignity, besides hewing down her idol, and burning it publicly under the walls of Jerusalem.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And also Maachah his mother, oven her he removed from being queen</span> [Rather, <span class="accented">queen-mother</span>. <span class="accented">Gebiruh</span>, as already pointed out on ch. 2:19, answers to the <span class="accented">Sultana Valide</span>. <span class="accented">The Vulgate reads, Ne esset princeps in sacris Priapi</span>.

It is probable that the <span class="accented">brook</span> was at this time flowing, and that the ashes of the wooden Asherah were cast into it; but the burning also took place in the <span class="accented">Wady</span>, or valley. We read of another similar burning in <a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4, 6</a>; but in this case the ashes were either carried to Bethel or cast upon the graves, to defile them. It is a fair inference that on this latter occasion the Kedron was dry. The valley, "the fields of the Kedron" (ver. 4 <span class="accented">l.c.</span>), is conveniently placed for such a purpose.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/15-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He also</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1443;&#1501;
