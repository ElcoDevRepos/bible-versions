Edom, located to the south of the Kingdom of Israel, was a frequent adversary of Israel. The Edomites were descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother, which adds a layer of familial tension to their conflicts. David's presence in Edom suggests a period of military activity aimed at subduing this neighboring nation, which was strategically important due to its control of trade routes and resources.<p><b>Joab the commander of the army</b><br>Joab was a key military leader under King David, known for his loyalty and effectiveness in battle, though also for his ruthlessness. As David's nephew, Joab held significant influence and was often involved in executing David's military strategies. His actions in Edom reflect his role as a decisive and sometimes brutal enforcer of David's policies.<p><b>had gone to bury the dead</b><br>This indicates a customary practice of honoring fallen soldiers by ensuring they received a proper burial. In the context of ancient Near Eastern warfare, burying the dead was an important ritual, reflecting respect for the deceased and adherence to cultural norms. It also suggests the aftermath of a significant battle or series of skirmishes in Edom.<p><b>and had struck down every male in Edom</b><br>This phrase highlights the severity of Joab's campaign in Edom. The complete destruction of the male population was a common practice in ancient warfare to prevent future retaliation and to weaken the enemy's ability to recover. This action fulfilled David's strategic objectives but also set the stage for future hostilities, as seen in the ongoing enmity between Israel and Edom. This act of violence can be compared to other biblical instances where entire populations were targeted, reflecting the harsh realities of ancient conflicts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his military prowess and his heart for God.

The narrator wants us to keep the bigger timeline in mind: David&#8217;s victories (<a href="/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13-14</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12-13</a>) secured Israel&#8217;s borders but also sowed seeds of future opposition. Scripture consistently shows how earlier events create later consequences, just as Jacob&#8217;s blessing of Esau hinted at Edom&#8217;s uneasy relationship with Israel (<a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when David was in Edom</b><p>David&#8217;s presence signals direct royal involvement. After defeating the Edomites, he stationed garrisons there so &#8220;all the Edomites became David&#8217;s servants&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>). That fulfilled Balaam&#8217;s oracle&#8212;&#8220;Edom will become a possession&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>). Yet David&#8217;s extended stay also gave surviving Edomites, like the young prince Hadad, the opportunity to escape (<a href="/1_kings/11-17.htm">1 Kings 11:17</a>). The text subtly shows how even decisive victories can leave lingering embers of resistance, a theme echoed in <a href="/psalms/60-8.htm">Psalm 60:8</a> where David celebrates God&#8217;s triumph over Edom but still prays for continued help.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joab the commander of the army</b><p>Joab was David&#8217;s toughest general, known for bold loyalty and brutal methods (<a href="/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-5.htm">1 Kings 2:5-6</a>). Here he acts as executor of David&#8217;s campaign. While Joab often protected David&#8217;s interests, his unchecked zeal sometimes left moral debris that later generations had to confront. The verse reminds us that leadership influence is far-reaching; the way Joab fought shaped Edom&#8217;s memory of Israel, setting the stage for Hadad&#8217;s vendetta (<a href="/1_kings/11-21.htm">1 Kings 11:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had gone to bury the dead</b><p>Before finishing the campaign, Joab paused to inter the fallen&#8212;likely Israelite soldiers. Burial was both a covenant duty (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>) and an act of respect that acknowledged each warrior&#8217;s dignity. Yet the solemn task did not soften Joab&#8217;s resolve. Instead, it underscored the high cost of the conflict. <a href="/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11</a> pictures burial after battle as part of cleansing the land; Joab&#8217;s action similarly cleared away defilement so Israel could claim Edom in purity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and had struck down every male in Edom</b><p>This phrase describes total military subjugation&#8212;standard language for eliminating future armed resistance. The severity mirrors commands for dealing with Amalek (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>) and anticipates later prophetic judgments on Edom (<a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-4.htm">Malachi 1:4</a>). From a literal standpoint, the text affirms that Joab&#8217;s campaign was thorough, explaining why only a handful like Hadad survived (<a href="/1_kings/11-16.htm">1 Kings 11:16-17</a>). The judgment also upholds God&#8217;s earlier word: Edom, long hostile to Israel, now experiences recompense (<a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 10</a>). Yet Scripture will later reveal God&#8217;s mercy even to Edom&#8217;s remnant (<a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11-12</a>), showing that divine justice and grace ultimately converge at His timing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15</a> reaches back into David&#8217;s era to explain Hadad&#8217;s hatred of Israel during Solomon&#8217;s reign. David&#8217;s physical presence in Edom, Joab&#8217;s leadership, the respectful burial of Israel&#8217;s dead, and the decisive eradication of Edomite males combined to bring a military victory that simultaneously planted seeds of future conflict. The verse illustrates how God&#8217;s faithful fulfillment of promises&#8212;establishing Israel&#8217;s borders&#8212;can still leave human hearts either humbled or hardened. Understanding this background helps us grasp why Solomon&#8217;s kingdom, though blessed, faced divinely allowed adversaries that kept the king&#8212;and by extension, us&#8212;dependent on the Lord&#8217;s ongoing guidance and grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) The war here described is briefly noted, with some differences of detail, in <a href="/context/2_samuel/8-12.htm" title="Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.">2Samuel 8:12-14</a>, <a href="/context/1_chronicles/18-11.htm" title="Them also king David dedicated to the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.">1Chronicles 18:11-13</a>, and Psalms 60 (title and <a href="/1_kings/11-8.htm" title="And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.">1Kings 11:8</a>). It is there closely connected with the great struggle with the Syrians, and the victory is ascribed in one record to Joab, in the other to Abishai. Here David himself is described as taking part in the war--perhaps completing the conquest, as in the war with Ammon, after it had been successfully begun by Joab (<a href="/context/2_samuel/12-26.htm" title="And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.">2Samuel 12:26-31</a>). (Instead of "David was in Edom," the LXX. and other versions read "David destroyed Edom," by a slight variation of the Hebrew text.) The war was evidently one of ruthless extermination of "every male," except those who fled the country, or found refuge in its rocky fastnesses, and was carried on by systematic ravage under the command of Joab. How it was provoked we do not know; for we have no previous notice of Edom since the time of the Exodus, except a reference to war against it in the days of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm" title="So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.">1Samuel 14:47</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it came to pass, when David was in Edom</span> [<a href="/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>.

The LXX., <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., reads <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> It was only vicariously, however, that David <span class="accented">smote</span> Edom, or was in Edom. According to <a href="/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>, <span class="accented">Abishai</span> slew 18,000 Edomites, while <a href="/psalms/60.htm">Psalm 60</a>. (title) represents <span class="accented">Joab</span> as having slain 12,000 at the same time and place. The two brothers were both in high command, or Abishal may have been detailed by Joab to this service], <span class="cmt_word">and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain</span> [The commentators generally are agreed that these are the Israelites slain by the Edomites during an invasion of Israel, and not either the Edomites or Israelites slain in the valley of Salt], <span class="cmt_word">after he had smitten</span> [rather, that <span class="accented">he smote</span>. This is the apodosis] <span class="cmt_word">every male in Edom.</span> [This is, of course, hyperbolical (cf. "all Israel" below). It is clear that the whole Edomite nation did not perish. The words point to a terrible slaughter (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/18-13.htm">1 Chronicles 18:13</a>) among the men of war. Possibly the cruelties of the Edomites (compare <a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>; <a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>) had provoked this act of retribution, as to which see <a href="/deuteronomy/20-13.htm">Deuteronomy 20:13</a>.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/11-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Earlier,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
