His sins are not detailed in this verse, but the context of <a href="/1_kings/16.htm">1 Kings 16</a> reveals a pattern of idolatry and rebellion against God. The sins of the kings of Israel often included idol worship, which was a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). This phrase underscores the biblical principle that sin has consequences, often leading to judgment and downfall.<p><b>doing evil in the sight of the LORD</b><br>This phrase is a common biblical expression used to describe actions that are contrary to God's will and commandments. It emphasizes that God is the ultimate judge of human actions, and His perspective is what defines good and evil. The phrase suggests that Zimri's actions were not just politically or socially wrong, but morally and spiritually offensive to God. This aligns with the biblical theme that God sees and judges the heart and actions of individuals (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>and following the example of Jeroboam</b><br>Jeroboam was the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy. He is infamous for establishing idol worship in Israel, setting up golden calves in Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). By following Jeroboam's example, Zimri perpetuated the sin of idolatry, leading the people away from the worship of Yahweh. This highlights the influence of leaders on the spiritual direction of a nation and the long-lasting impact of their actions.<p><b>and the sin he had committed</b><br>This refers back to Jeroboam's specific sin of introducing and institutionalizing idol worship in Israel. Jeroboam's actions were a direct challenge to the worship of the one true God and were motivated by political expediency to prevent the people from returning to Jerusalem to worship (<a href="/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-27</a>). This sin set a precedent for subsequent kings, including Zimri, who continued in this idolatrous practice.<p><b>and had caused Israel to commit</b><br>The phrase indicates the corporate nature of sin and its impact on the community. Jeroboam's sin was not just personal but had national repercussions, leading the entire nation into idolatry. This reflects the biblical understanding that leaders bear responsibility for the spiritual state of their people. It also serves as a warning of how individual sin can have widespread consequences, affecting not just the sinner but also those around them. This concept is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as the sin of Achan affecting the entire nation of Israel (Joshua 7).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zimri.htm">Zimri</a></b><br>A king of Israel who reigned for only seven days.

Scripture never treats sin as an abstract concept; it is always personal and accountable. Zimri&#8217;s seven-day reign was soaked in bloodshed and treachery (<a href="/1_kings/16-10.htm">1 Kings 16:10-13</a>). Like Cain (<a href="/genesis/4-7.htm">Genesis 4:7</a>) and Achan (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1, 11</a>), he discovered that hidden wickedness eventually demands payment (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).

Zimri&#8217;s acts were not merely political crimes; they were deeds performed &#8220;in the sight of the LORD.&#8221; Nothing escapes His gaze (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-15</a>; 2 Chron 16:9). The Lord&#8212;not public opinion&#8212;defines evil.<p>&#8226; Rebellion, murder, and idolatry may be celebrated by culture, yet remain evil before God (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>).<p>&#8226; When a king&#8217;s throne is built on sin, his reign collapses (<a href="/proverbs/16-12.htm">Proverbs 16:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Following the example of Jeroboam</b><p>Jeroboam I had introduced golden calves at Bethel and Dan, saying, &#8220;Here are your gods, O Israel&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). From that moment, &#8220;walking in the way of Jeroboam&#8221; became shorthand for leading Israel into idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/13-33.htm">1 Kings 13:33-34</a>; 14:16; 22:52).

God sees, judges, and repays sin, especially when leaders drag others into it.

Bahr thinks that he had "formerly displayed much partiality for the calf worship." But it is quite as likely that the idea in the historian's mind was that all these events were the bitter fruits of Jeroboam's misguided and impious policy, into the spirit of which, Zimri, like his predecessors, had been baptized. It is interesting to remember here the aspect these repeated revolutions and assassinations would wear to the kingdom of Judah, then enjoying quietness and prosperity under Asa. We cannot doubt for a moment that they were regarded as so many manifestations of the righteous judgment of God, and as the outcomes of that spirit of insubordination and impiety which, in their eyes, had brought about both the division of the kingdom and the schism in the church.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/16-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">because of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the sins</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1514;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124;
