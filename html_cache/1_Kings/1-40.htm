The people of Israel recognized Solomon as the legitimate successor to David, which was crucial for maintaining unity in the kingdom. This event took place in Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel, emphasizing the importance of the city in God's plan. The people's following of Solomon can be seen as a type of Christ, as Jesus is followed by His people as the rightful King.<p><b>playing flutes</b><br>The use of musical instruments in celebrations was common in ancient Israel. Flutes, along with other instruments, were often used in religious and royal ceremonies. This reflects the cultural practices of the time, where music played a significant role in expressing joy and worship. The playing of flutes here signifies the celebratory nature of Solomon's anointing, similar to the joy expressed in <a href="/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>, which calls for praising God with various instruments.<p><b>and rejoicing with such a great joy</b><br>The people's joy was immense, reflecting their approval and hope for Solomon's reign. This joy can be compared to the joy of the Israelites when David brought the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14-15</a>). It also foreshadows the joy of believers in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>, where the angel announces good news of great joy at the birth of Jesus, the ultimate King.<p><b>that the earth was split by the sound</b><br>This hyperbolic expression emphasizes the magnitude of the celebration. The phrase suggests that the joy and noise were so intense that it seemed to shake the earth. This can be seen as a metaphor for the impact of Solomon's anointing on the nation of Israel. It also echoes the powerful events in Scripture where God's presence or actions cause the earth to tremble, such as in <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a> at Mount Sinai. This foreshadows the ultimate shaking of the earth at Christ's return, as described in <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26-27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is anointed as king in this passage, marking the beginning of his reign over Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The aging king of Israel who orchestrates the anointing of Solomon to ensure a peaceful transition of power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zadok_the_priest_and_nathan_the_prophet.htm">Zadok the Priest and Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>Key figures who support Solomon's anointing, representing religious and prophetic authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gihon.htm">Gihon</a></b><br>The location where Solomon is anointed king, a significant site near Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>They express overwhelming joy and support for Solomon's anointing, signifying unity and approval of his kingship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_joy_of_god's_plan.htm">The Joy of God's Plan</a></b><br>The people's rejoicing reflects the joy that comes from witnessing God's plan unfold.

But the objection loses its force when it is observed (Rawlinson) that the text implies that only <span class="accented">some</span> of the people piped. "<span class="accented">All</span> the people came up... and <span class="accented">the people</span>," etc. Besides, even if it were not so, some allowance is surely to be made for Eastern hyperbole. And the received text is to be preferred on other grounds.
