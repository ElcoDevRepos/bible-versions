Egypt, a powerful and influential nation, was a significant ally. This alliance reflects Solomon's diplomatic acumen but also raises concerns about the influence of foreign cultures and religions on Israel, as warned in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>. The marriage foreshadows future issues with idolatry, as Solomon's foreign wives later lead him astray (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>). This union also prefigures the broader theme of Israel's struggle with maintaining covenant faithfulness amidst external influences.<p><b>Solomon brought her to the City of David until he had finished building his palace and the house of the LORD, as well as the wall around Jerusalem.</b><br>The City of David, located in Jerusalem, was the original stronghold captured by David and became the political and spiritual center of Israel. Bringing Pharaoh's daughter here indicates her importance and the significance of the alliance. Solomon's construction projects, including his palace, the temple (house of the LORD), and the fortification of Jerusalem, highlight his role as a builder and consolidator of the kingdom. These projects fulfill David's vision for a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7:1-13</a>) and establish Jerusalem as the enduring capital of Israel. The building of the temple is a type of Christ, who is the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), and the wall signifies protection and separation, themes echoed in the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10-27</a>). Solomon's extensive building activities also reflect the prosperity and peace during his reign, fulfilling the promises made to David regarding his son (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.

Scripture moves seamlessly from the consolidation of the kingdom (<a href="/2_chronicles/1-1.htm">2 Chronicles 1:1</a>) to the alliances Solomon forged, showing an orderly, literal progression of history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Solomon formed an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt</b><p>&#8226; The text records an actual political treaty, something common among Near-Eastern monarchs.<p>&#8226; While the agreement promised peace on Israel&#8217;s southern border (compare <a href="/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>), it also flirted with the very dependence on Egypt that <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a> warns against.<p>&#8226; Prophets later reminded Israel that trust belongs to the LORD, not to Egypt (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).

Though this union may have looked wise politically, it planted seeds that blossomed into the spiritual compromises described in <a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a> and later echoed in <a href="/nehemiah/13-26.htm">Nehemiah 13:26</a>.<p>&#8226; At the same time, the narrative underscores that Scripture records events faithfully, including choices that fall short of God&#8217;s best.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Solomon brought her to the City of David</b><p>&#8226; The City of David&#8212;Jerusalem&#8217;s original fortress (<a href="/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>)&#8212;became her temporary residence.<p>&#8226; Housing her close to the ark highlighted the unmatched status of the royal household, yet <a href="/2_chronicles/8-11.htm">2 Chronicles 8:11</a> shows Solomon later moved her because &#8220;no wife of mine is to live in the house of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the LORD has entered are holy.&#8221; The move hints at an uneasiness about mixing foreign influence with holy space.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until he had finished building his palace</b><p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s palace complex, begun in his fourth year (<a href="/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>) and completed after thirteen years (<a href="/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a>), served as the permanent royal residence.<p>&#8226; The delay in moving Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter suggests Solomon recognized an incomplete palace was unfit for a queen and perhaps sought to limit her visibility while construction continued.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The temple, started the same year as the palace but finished earlier, in seven years (<a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>), demonstrates Solomon&#8217;s priority on worship.<p>&#8226; By linking palace and temple in the same sentence, Scripture shows royal authority and divine worship advancing side by side (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1-2</a>).

The verse showcases Solomon&#8217;s rising international stature and his energetic construction of palace, temple, and fortifications. At the same time, it gently signals tensions between political expediency and covenant faithfulness&#8212;tensions that will unfold through Solomon&#8217;s later life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Pharaoh king of Egypt</span>.--At this time it would appear, from the Egyptian records and traditions, that Egypt was weak and divided, and that what is called the twenty-first dynasty of the Tanite kings was ruling in Lower Egypt. This, and a corresponding abeyance (judging from the monuments) of Assyrian power, gave scope for the rise to sudden greatness and wealth of the Israelite kingdom under Solomon, and probably induced the Egyptian king of those days to consent to an alliance which, at other times, the greatness of the Pharaohs might have spumed. No fault is found with the alliance by the sacred historian, for the Egyptians were never looked upon with the same aversion as the strange women of the Canaanite races. As, moreover, it is not in any way connected with Solomon's subsequent declension into idolatry, noticed in <a href="/context/1_kings/11-1.htm" title="But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:">1Kings 11:1-8</a>, it is not unlikely that the new queen literally acted on the call of the Psalmist (<a href="/psalms/45-10.htm" title="Listen, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear; forget also your own people, and your father's house;">Psalm 45:10</a>) to "forget her own people and her father's house."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Solomon made affinit</span>y [Not "alliance" (as some have supposed) but relationship. Lit., <span class="accented">made himself son-in-law</span>] with <span class="cmt_word">Pharaoh king of Egypt</span> [which of the Pharaohs this was, it is impossible to say with certainty. As, however, Shishak (<a href="/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-25.htm">1 Kings 14:25</a>) is undoubtedly the Sheshonk who succeeded to the throne of Egypt in the 26th year of Solomon (Poole), and who was the first king of the 22nd dynasty of Manetho, we may safely identify this Pharaoh with "a late king of the 21st (or Janite) dynasty." It has been assumed (Bunsen, Ewald, Brugsch, <span class="accented">al.</span>) that it was Psusennes II., the last king of that house, on the supposition that he reigned 35 years, (as stated by Eusebius), but according to Africanus, his reign was limited to 14 years. It is wiser to say, therefore, with Mr. Poole (Dict. Bib., "Pharaoh") that this Pharaoh "cannot yet be identified on Manetho's list." It is also impossible to decide whether the alliance was first sought by Solomon with a view to win over a powerful and dangerous neighbour (Thenius), to whose inroads his northern border was exposed, and especially to counteract the influence (<a href="/1_kings/11-21.htm">1 Kings 11:21</a>) of Hadad (Plumptre), or whether the marriage was proposed by Pharaoh because the 21st dynasty "had then become very weak" (Rawlinson) and its head desired "friendly relations with the kingdom of Israel, which had grown into a power to be dreaded" (Keil). But we may reasonably suppose that the alliance "must have been to most Israelites a very startling one" (Plumptre.) Egypt (Rahab, <a href="/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>) was to every Israelite a name both of triumph and dread. The Pharaohs were their ancestral foes], <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">took Pharaoh's daughter</span> [A marriage such as this was not without precedent (<a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>; <a href="/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>; <a href="/numbers/12-1.htm">Numbers 12:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13</a>), nor was it condemned by the Law, which only forbade intermarriage with the nations of Canaan (<a href="/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>), and sanctioned the union of an Israelite with a captive taken in war (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-13.htm">Deuteronomy 21:13</a>; cf. 20:14). "At the same time, it was only when the foreign wives renounced idolatry, that such marriages were in accordance with the spirit of the law" (Keil). As Solomon at this period of his life faithfully observed the law, as he is never blamed for this marriage, and as there is no trace whatever of the introduction of Egyptian rites into Israel, it is a fair presumption that the Egyptian princess conformed to the religion of her adopted country], <span class="cmt_word">and brought her into the city of David</span> [<a href="/2_chronicles/8-11.htm">2 Chronicles 8:11</a> speaks of her dwelling in "the <span class="accented">house</span> of David," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, it would seem, the palace which David had occupied] <span class="cmt_word">until he had made an end</span> [this hardly shows that he had begun to build, as Keil infers. He did not begin building the Temple until the fourth (<a href="/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>), nor his own house until the eleventh year (<a href="/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a>) after his accession, and the marriage, though not at the very commencement of his reign, can hardly have been delayed to the eleventh year, and may have taken place before the death of Shimei] <span class="cmt_word">of building his own house</span> [cf. <a href="/1_kings/7-7.htm">1 Kings 7:7</a>] <span class="cmt_word">and the house of the Lord</span> [cf. <a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-51.htm">1 Kings 7:51</a>] <span class="cmt_word">and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</span> [Probably, he both strengthened and extended the city walls, as Josephus (Ant. 8:06.1) affirms. Acc. to the LXX. addition to ch. 12, it was on this task that Jeroboam was employed (<a href="/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>; cf. 9:15).
