David's reign was marked by military conquests, the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital, and the unification of the tribes of Israel. His impending death signifies the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter under Solomon. The phrase also reflects the biblical theme of mortality and the passing of leadership from one generation to the next, a common motif throughout Scripture. David's life and reign are chronicled in 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel, providing a backdrop to this moment.<p><b>he charged his son Solomon</b><br>David's charge to Solomon is both a personal and a royal mandate. It underscores the importance of succession planning and the continuation of God's covenant promises through David's lineage. Solomon, whose name means "peace," is chosen to build the temple, fulfilling God's promise to David that his son would construct a house for the Lord (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). This charge is not merely a transfer of power but a spiritual and moral exhortation, emphasizing obedience to God's laws and statutes. Solomon's reign is pivotal, as it represents the height of Israel's united monarchy and foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Son of David" (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>), fulfilling the messianic prophecies associated with David's line.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and his leadership.

Scripture treats such moments with sober clarity&#8212;the Lord numbers our days (<a href="/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>), and David, a man after God&#8217;s own heart, lives within that divine timetable.<p>&#8226; Life has seasons; endings are part of God&#8217;s design (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Nearing death prompts reflection and readiness, much like Paul&#8217;s &#8220;the time of my departure is at hand&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>).<p>David&#8217;s awareness invites us to live wisely now, &#8220;teaching us to number our days&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for David to die</b><p>The text does not soften the reality&#8212;death is certain (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). Yet for the believer it is not defeat. David &#8220;served the purpose of God in his own generation and fell asleep&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-36.htm">Acts 13:36</a>).<p>&#8226; His reign of roughly forty years (<a href="/1_kings/2-11.htm">1 Kings 2:11</a>) is coming to a close.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant with David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>) stands beyond the grave, proving that death cannot thwart divine promises.<p>In this moment we see both human frailty and God&#8217;s enduring faithfulness side by side.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he charged</b><p>A &#8220;charge&#8221; is more than advice; it is a binding, weighty commission (<a href="/joshua/23-2.htm">Joshua 23:2</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Final words carry urgency&#8212;think of Moses to Joshua (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7&#8211;8</a>) or Paul to Timothy (<a href="/2_timothy/4-1.htm">2 Timothy 4:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; The Hebrew idea of charge implies accountability before God; Solomon must heed or answer to the Lord.<p>David will soon articulate the charge: &#8220;Be strong and prove yourself a man. And keep the charge of the LORD your God&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/2-2.htm">1 Kings 2:2&#8211;3</a>). Obedience, not merely political savvy, is central.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his son Solomon</b><p>The baton passes within covenant lineage.

The verse reminds us that life is brief, death is certain, and godly responsibility must be passed on deliberately. David models finishing well; Solomon is summoned to begin well&#8212;both under the unchanging faithfulness of the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I go the way</span> [lit., I am walking (same word as in ver. 3) in the way] <span class="cmt_word">of all the earth</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of all the sons of earth, all mankind (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-24.htm">1 Kings 10:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/66-4.htm">Psalm 66:4</a>, etc.) The path to Sheol, the path which all his forefathers, and untold millions more, have trod, he is treading it now. The words sound like a <span class="accented">reminiscence</span> of <a href="/joshua/23.htm">Joshua 23, 24</a>. Perhaps, too, the thought of Joshua suggested to his mind the next words]: <span class="cmt_word">but</span> <span class="cmt_word">be thou strong, and be a man.</span> [Similar, though not identical, words were four times addressed to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6, 7, 9, 18</a>), and David may well have thought that his son, in entering upon his difficult duties, was not at all unlike Joshua when he succeeded Moses in the leadership of Israel, and that he needed similar encouragement. It is not necessary to suppose, as Canon Rawlinson does ("Speaker's Com.," vol. 2 p. 489), that in the words, "show thyself a man," we have a reference to Solomon's <span class="accented">youth</span>; for words precisely similar were addressed to each other by the Philistines at Aphek (<a href="/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9</a>). The age of Solomon at his accession is very doubtful. David said, "Solomon my son is young and tender" (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-5.htm">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>); and Solomon says of himself, "I am a little child" <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span> (<a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>). Josephus, probably reflecting the tradition of his time, fixes his age at fourteen; Eupolemus at twelve. I incline to think that the words "young and tender" almost forbid the favourite opinion that he was about twenty.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/2-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As the time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;m&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">drew near</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
