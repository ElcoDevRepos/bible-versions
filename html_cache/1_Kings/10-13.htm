The queen of Sheba's visit is a testament to Solomon's widespread fame and wisdom, as she traveled a great distance to test him with hard questions. The giving of "all she desired" suggests a fulfillment of her expectations and a recognition of Solomon's ability to meet her needs. This act of giving can be seen as a reflection of God's abundant provision, as Solomon's wisdom and wealth were gifts from God (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12-13</a>).<p><b>whatever she asked&#8212;</b><br>The phrase indicates that Solomon was willing to grant the queen's requests, showcasing his diplomatic skills and the prosperity of his reign. This willingness to give whatever was asked can be seen as a parallel to God's promise to grant the desires of those who seek Him (<a href="/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>). It also reflects the cultural practice of royal generosity and hospitality in the ancient Near East, where rulers would often exchange gifts to establish alliances and demonstrate their wealth and power.<p><b>besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the extent of Solomon's generosity. The "royal bounty" refers to the wealth and resources at Solomon's disposal as king. The additional gifts beyond what she requested highlight the abundance of Solomon's kingdom and his willingness to share it. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who gives abundantly beyond what we ask or think (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>). The royal bounty also underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to make Solomon exceedingly prosperous (<a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>).<p><b>Then she left and returned to her own country,</b><br>The queen's departure signifies the completion of her mission and the successful diplomatic exchange between her and Solomon. Her return to her own country suggests that she was satisfied with her visit and the answers she received. This journey back can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual journey of seeking wisdom and returning enriched. The queen of Sheba's visit is later referenced by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>, where He uses her example to illustrate the importance of seeking wisdom and recognizing God's work.<p><b>along with her servants.</b><br>The mention of her servants indicates the queen's status and the entourage that accompanied her, which was typical for a royal visit. This detail highlights the logistical and diplomatic efforts involved in such a journey. The presence of her servants also underscores the importance of the visit, as they would have witnessed the exchange and carried the news of Solomon's wisdom and wealth back to Sheba. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of testimony and witness, as the queen's experience would have spread Solomon's fame even further.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is renowned for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.

Her present is of the nature of tribute. Solomon gives her of "his bounty," both what she asked for (probably by praising it) and what else he would.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba an her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">according to the hand of king Solomon</span>. The chronicler has, "beside that which she had brought unto the king." That is to say, in addition to the fitting presents which he made in return for her gifts, he freely gave her whatsoever she asked for. To ask for a coveted thing is no breach of Oriental propriety. The Ethiopian Christians find in these words (and considering the character of Solomon and the license of that age, perhaps not altogether without reason) a basis for their belief that she bore Solomon a son, Melimelek by name, from whom, indeed, the present sovereigns of Abyssinia claim to derive their descent.] <span class="cmt_word">So</span> <span class="cmt_word">she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</span> Bishop Wordsworth has remarked (p. 44) that the record of this visit disappoints us. He says, "He (Solomon) answered her hard questions. He showed her his palace... but we do not hear that he invited her to go up with him into the house of the Lord," etc. Again: "The visit of the queen of Sheba seem to have been without any spiritual result." "In like manner," he adds, "we hear nothing of any attempt on Solomon's part to improve his friendship and commercial relations with Hiram into an occasion for communicating the better merchandise of Divine truth to the Sidonians." But surely this criticism overlooks the fact that Judaism was not a missionary religion, and that the chosen people had no sort of commission to convert the heathen, It is, no doubt, a mystery; but it is a fact, that for 2,000 years the light of God's truth was, by the counsel and purpose of God, restricted within the extremely narrow confines of Israel, and that the "fulness of the time," when the Gentiles should be "fellow heirs," was distant from Solomon's day by a whole millennium., <p> CHAPTER 10:14-29. SOLOMON'S WEALTH, POMP, AND POWER. The visit of the Queen of Sheba, in itself a striking proof of the fame and greatness of Solomon, is followed by a description of his revenues, his throne, and various other particulars of his wealth and magnificence, some of which are related here because they were the products of the voyages of that same fleet which had been the means of acquainting the queen with Solomon and his glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/10-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1448;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
