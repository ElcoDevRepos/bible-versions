Ahab was known for his idolatry and opposition to the prophets of Yahweh, while Jehoshaphat was a more righteous king who sought to follow God. The alliance between these two kings is significant, as it reflects the political and military strategies of the time, where neighboring kingdoms often formed alliances for mutual benefit. This interaction takes place in the context of a proposed military campaign against Ramoth-gilead, a city of strategic importance located east of the Jordan River.<p><b>&#8220;Did I not tell you</b><br>Ahab's words here reveal his frustration and perhaps a sense of vindication. He had previously warned Jehoshaphat about the prophet Micaiah, whom he believed would not deliver favorable prophecies. This statement underscores Ahab's awareness of Micaiah's reputation for speaking truthfully, regardless of the king's desires. It also highlights the tension between Ahab's desire for favorable prophecies and the reality of God's messages through His prophets.<p><b>that he never prophesies good for me,</b><br>Ahab's complaint reflects his ongoing conflict with the prophets of Yahweh, who often condemned his actions and those of his wife, Jezebel. This tension is a recurring theme in the narrative of Ahab's reign, as seen in his interactions with Elijah and other prophets. Ahab's desire for positive prophecies is indicative of his unwillingness to repent and align his actions with God's will. This phrase also illustrates the broader biblical theme of the rejection of God's messengers by those in power.<p><b>but only bad?&#8221;</b><br>The "bad" prophecies Ahab refers to are those that call for repentance and warn of judgment due to his idolatry and disobedience. This reflects the biblical principle that God's messages often challenge human sinfulness and call for a return to righteousness. Ahab's perception of these prophecies as "bad" highlights his spiritual blindness and resistance to divine correction. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual fulfillment of Micaiah's prophecy, which predicts Ahab's downfall, aligning with the biblical theme of the certainty of God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahab.htm">King Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his idolatry and opposition to the prophets of the Lord.

Jehoshaphat stands as a witness, illustrating the peril of partnering with the unrepentant. The verse reminds us that the measure of a prophecy is not whether it sounds pleasant, but whether it is true to God&#8217;s revealed Word. Accepting Scripture&#8217;s hard warnings leads to life; rejecting them, like Ahab, courts disaster.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">say to thee, He will</span>, etc.] <span class="cmt_word">prophesy no good concerning me but evil?</span> [It is clear that Ahab had understood perfectly the purport of Micaiah's words.
