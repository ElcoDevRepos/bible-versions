In the context of childbirth, it reflects the vulnerability and recovery period for a mother. The third day is also a recurring motif in Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/22-4.htm">Genesis 22:4</a> with Abraham and Isaac, and most notably in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, symbolizing new life and hope.<p><b>this woman also had a baby</b><br>The mention of another woman having a baby highlights the shared experience and potential for conflict. In ancient Israel, childbirth was a significant event, often involving midwives and community support. The absence of others in this narrative sets the stage for the ensuing dispute. The parallel births also serve to emphasize the theme of life and the preciousness of children, a recurring theme in the Bible.<p><b>We were alone</b><br>The isolation of the two women is crucial to the story, as it underscores the lack of witnesses to verify their claims. This setting creates a scenario where truth must be discerned through wisdom rather than evidence. The theme of being alone can also be seen in other biblical narratives where individuals face trials or decisions without external support, such as Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/19.htm">1 Kings 19</a>.<p><b>with no one in the house but the two of us</b><br>The absence of others in the house emphasizes the personal and intimate nature of the conflict. It also reflects the societal structure where women, especially those of lower status, might find themselves without the protection or advocacy of a male figure. This setting allows for a direct appeal to King Solomon's wisdom, showcasing his role as a divinely appointed judge. The lack of witnesses parallels other biblical stories where truth is revealed through divine insight, such as the judgment of Daniel in Susanna (an apocryphal addition to the Book of Daniel).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel known for his wisdom, who is the judge in this account.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_women.htm">Two Women</a></b><br>The central figures in this account, both of whom are mothers and come to Solomon for judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>The setting where the events took place, emphasizing the isolation and lack of witnesses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_infants.htm">The Infants</a></b><br>The two babies born to the women, one of whom tragically dies, leading to the dispute.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_throne_of_judgment.htm">The Throne of Judgment</a></b><br>The place where Solomon hears the case, symbolizing his role as a wise and discerning king.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_wisdom.htm">The Value of Wisdom</a></b><br>Solomon's ability to discern the truth highlights the importance of seeking God's wisdom in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_life.htm">The Sanctity of Life</a></b><br>The account underscores the preciousness of life and the deep bond between a mother and her child.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/truth_and_integrity.htm">Truth and Integrity</a></b><br>The account challenges us to uphold truth and integrity, even when no one else is watching.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice.htm">God's Justice</a></b><br>Solomon's judgment reflects God's perfect justice, reminding us to trust in His righteous ways.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_community.htm">The Role of Community</a></b><br>The absence of witnesses in the house points to the importance of community and accountability in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_3_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 3:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_3_18_Solomon_s_wise_judgment.htm">How does 1 Kings 3:18 demonstrate God's wisdom in Solomon's judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_3_18_Discernment_s_value.htm">What does 1 Kings 3:18 teach about the importance of discernment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Use_Solomon_s_wisdom_in_daily_choices_2.htm">How can we apply Solomon's wisdom in our daily decision-making?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_this_verse_to_James_1_5_on_wisdom.htm">How does this verse connect to James 1:5 about asking for wisdom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Truth_s_role_in_conflict_resolution_in_1_Kings_3_18.htm">What role does truth play in resolving conflicts, as seen in 1 Kings 3:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_3_18_Solomon_s_wisdom_shown.htm">What does 1 Kings 3:18 reveal about God's wisdom in Solomon's judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_3_18_Leadership_discernment.htm">How does 1 Kings 3:18 demonstrate the importance of discernment in leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_1_Kings_3_18_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in 1 Kings 3:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_kings_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Kings 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_the_lord_present_there.htm">Who is the true mother of the living child?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_to_explain_'tongues_of_fire'.htm">How can 'tongues of fire' (Acts 2:3) be scientifically or physically explained?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_swift_secret_messaging_in_2_sam_17_15-21_realistic.htm">How realistic is the swift exchange of secret messages in 2 Samuel 17:15-21, given the distance and security risks involved in ancient Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/can_you_find_peace_and_remain_still.htm">What did the Ark of the Covenant contain?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 1 Kings 3:18 Mean</div><b>On the third day after I gave birth</b><p>&#8226;

(<a href="/genesis/22-4.htm">Genesis 22:4</a>); &#8220;After two days He will revive us; on the third day He will raise us up&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>); &#8220;On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning&#8221;

The births are virtually simultaneous, placing both women on equal footing and eliminating claims of seniority.<p>&#8226; Similar parallels of near-simultaneous births create rivalry in Scripture&#8212;think of Jacob and Esau in <a href="/genesis/25-24.htm">Genesis 25:24&#8211;26</a>.<p>&#8226; Life itself is highlighted as God&#8217;s gift: &#8220;Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail points to the coming conflict: two infants, one tragic night, no outside witnesses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We were alone</b><p>&#8226; No family, no midwives, no servants&#8212;just the two mothers.<p>&#8226; This absence of witnesses is crucial because Mosaic Law requires &#8220;two or three witnesses&#8221; for any matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>;

(<a href="/2_kings/4-4.htm">2 Kings 4:4</a>); Jesus taught, &#8220;Go into your inner room, shut your door and pray&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Morally, each woman now stands before God alone&#8212;&#8220;Nothing in all creation is hidden from God&#8217;s sight&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative sets the stage for Solomon&#8217;s famed verdict, showcasing how divine wisdom pierces human secrecy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The verse gives precise, literal details&#8212;timing, parallel births, utter isolation&#8212;that tighten the drama and highlight human vulnerability. With no witnesses, the truth must be uncovered by God-bestowed wisdom.
