Jeroboam had established alternative worship centers in Bethel and Dan to prevent his people from going to Jerusalem, which was in the southern kingdom of Judah. The altar splitting apart is a miraculous sign demonstrating God's disapproval of Jeroboam's idolatrous practices. The altar's destruction symbolizes the futility and impermanence of false worship. This act of divine intervention serves as a warning against idolatry, echoing the fate of other altars dedicated to false gods throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and the ashes poured out</b><br>The pouring out of ashes signifies the desecration and nullification of the sacrifices offered on the altar. In ancient Israelite culture, ashes were often associated with mourning and repentance, but here they represent the rejection of illegitimate worship. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God rejects offerings that are not made in accordance with His commandments, such as in <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13-15</a>, where God expresses disdain for insincere sacrifices. The pouring out of ashes underscores the theme of divine judgment against idolatry.<p><b>according to the sign that the man of God had given</b><br>The man of God, whose name is not mentioned, acts as a prophet delivering God's message. This phrase highlights the role of prophets as God's messengers, often performing signs to authenticate their divine commission. The fulfillment of the sign given by the man of God serves to validate his message and authority. This is consistent with the biblical pattern where God confirms His word through signs and wonders, as seen in the ministries of Moses (<a href="/exodus/4.htm">Exodus 4:1-9</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-39</a>).<p><b>by the word of the LORD</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the prophecy and the authority behind the actions taken. The word of the LORD is a central theme throughout the Bible, representing God's will and purpose. It is through His word that creation came into being (Genesis 1), and it is by His word that prophets speak. This underscores the reliability and power of God's word, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where it is stated that God's word will not return void but will accomplish what He desires. The fulfillment of the prophecy concerning the altar serves as a testament to the certainty and authority of God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God from Judah to Bethel to deliver a message against the altar that King Jeroboam had erected for idol worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_jeroboam.htm">King Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, who led the people into idolatry by setting up golden calves in Bethel and Dan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>Constructed by Jeroboam in Bethel as part of his idolatrous worship practices, which was the focus of God's judgment through the prophet.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant location in the northern kingdom where Jeroboam set up one of the golden calves, turning it into a center of false worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sign.htm">The Sign</a></b><br>A miraculous event where the altar was split and the ashes poured out, confirming the authenticity of the prophet's message from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to God's judgment.
