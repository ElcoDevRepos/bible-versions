It underscores the authority and authenticity of the message that follows. The "word of the LORD" is often a call to action or a pronouncement of judgment, reflecting God's sovereign will. This phrase is reminiscent of other instances where God communicates with His prophets, such as with Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-21.htm">1 Samuel 3:21</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a>).<p><b>came to Elijah the Tishbite</b><br>Elijah is one of the most prominent prophets in the Old Testament, known for his zealous defense of the worship of Yahweh against the encroaching idolatry of Baal. The designation "the Tishbite" refers to his origin from Tishbe in Gilead, a region east of the Jordan River. Elijah's role as a prophet is significant, as he often confronts the kings of Israel, particularly Ahab, with messages of judgment and calls for repentance. His life and ministry are marked by miraculous events and a fervent commitment to God's covenant. Elijah's appearance in the New Testament during the Transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17-3.htm">Matthew 17:3</a>) highlights his enduring significance in biblical history.<p><b>saying</b><br>This introduces the specific message that God is about to deliver through Elijah. The use of "saying" indicates that what follows is a direct quotation from God, emphasizing the importance and immediacy of the message. In the context of <a href="/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a>, this message is a response to the events surrounding Naboth's vineyard, where King Ahab and Queen Jezebel have committed grave injustices. The prophetic message that follows is a pronouncement of divine judgment, a common theme in the prophetic literature where God addresses the moral and spiritual failings of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah_the_tishbite.htm">Elijah the Tishbite</a></b><br>A prophet of God known for his boldness and faithfulness in delivering God's messages, often confronting kings and false prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who communicates His will and judgment through His prophets.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>Although not mentioned in this specific verse, King Ahab is the context of the chapter.
