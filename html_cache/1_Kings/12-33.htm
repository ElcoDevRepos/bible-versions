The verse warns believers to honor God&#8217;s revealed pattern, resist the lure of convenience, and refuse any form of man-made religion that competes with the finished work of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">So he offered upon the altar.</span>--The repetition of this verse is accounted for by its belonging properly in sense to the next chapter, opening the story of the mission of the "man of God from Judah." The idea of the verse would be best conveyed by rendering the verbs of this verse in the imperfect tense: "So Jeroboam was offering," &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he offered</span> [Heb. went up, as before.

See on 1 Kings 13:3 (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>). And this meaning is justified by <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9, 17</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-16.htm">1 Samuel 2:16</a>; <a href="/amos/4-5.htm">Amos 4:5</a>, where the same word is used. It cannot be denied, however, that the word is generally used of incense, and it is very probable that both this and sacrifices were offered by Jeroboam on the same altar (cf. <a href="/1_kings/11-8.htm">1 Kings 11:8</a>). We may perhaps see in Jeroboam's ministering in person, not only the design to invest the new ordinance with exceptional interest and splendour, but also the idea of encouraging his new priests to enter on their unauthorized functions with. out fear. The history, or even the traditions, of Nadab and Abihu (<a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10</a>.) and of Korah and his company (<a href="/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>), and the threatenings of the law (<a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7, 22</a>, cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/26-20.htm">2 Chronicles 26:20</a>), may well have made them hesitate. To allay their fears the king undertakes to offer the first of the sacrifices. And that their fears of a Divine interposition were not groundless the sequel shows.] <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/12-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the fifteenth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
