In this context, it emphasizes the divine authority behind the message. Prophets played a crucial role in guiding the kings of Israel, often delivering messages of warning, guidance, or assurance. The king of Israel at this time was Ahab, who reigned during a period of significant conflict with surrounding nations, including the Arameans.<p><b>&#8220;This is what the LORD says:</b><br>This phrase is a common prophetic introduction, indicating that the message is not from the prophet himself but directly from God. It underscores the authority and reliability of the message. The use of "LORD" in all capitals signifies the covenant name of God, Yahweh, highlighting His personal relationship with Israel.<p><b>&#8216;Because the Arameans have said that the LORD is a god of the hills and not of the valleys,</b><br>The Arameans' belief reflects a common ancient Near Eastern view that deities had limited territorial power. They assumed that Yahweh, the God of Israel, was only powerful in the hills where Israel had previously defeated them. This misunderstanding of God's omnipotence and sovereignty sets the stage for God to demonstrate His power over all creation, not confined to specific geographical locations.<p><b>I will deliver all this great army into your hand.</b><br>God's promise to deliver the Aramean army into Israel's hand is a demonstration of His power and faithfulness. Despite Israel's unfaithfulness, God chooses to act for His name's sake. This deliverance is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God intervenes on behalf of His people, such as the victories of Gideon and David. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ.<p><b>Then you will know that I am the LORD.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The purpose of God's intervention is to reveal His identity and power to both Israel and the Arameans. This phrase echoes the recurring biblical theme of God making Himself known through His mighty acts. It is a call to recognize and acknowledge Yahweh as the one true God. This revelation is not only for the immediate audience but also points to the ultimate revelation of God through Jesus Christ, who fully reveals the nature and character of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God to deliver His message to the king of Israel.

By sending a prophet, promising total victory, and fulfilling it, God defended His own honor and reminded Israel that He alone is sovereign.

The episode calls God&#8217;s people in every age to trust His boundless power and acknowledge that He is the Lord over all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28)<span class= "bld">A man of God</span>--apparently not the same as before. We see from <a href="/1_kings/20-35.htm" title="And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray you. And the man refused to smite him.">1Kings 20:35</a> that the prophetic order was now numerous. The vindication of the majesty of God before the Syrians, as well as before Israel--like the more celebrated case of the rebuke of the blasphemy of Sennacherib (<a href="/context/2_kings/19-16.htm" title="LORD, bow down your ear, and hear: open, LORD, your eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which has sent him to reproach the living God.">2Kings 19:16-34</a>)--is in accordance with the prayer of Solomon, or the similar utterances in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/67-2.htm" title="That your way may be known on earth, your saving health among all nations.">Psalm 67:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/102-15.htm" title="So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth your glory.">Psalm 102:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/138-4.htm" title="All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O LORD, when they hear the words of your mouth.">Psalm 138:4</a>), "That all the people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee;" and also with such prophetic declarations as those of <a href="/ezekiel/20-9.htm" title="But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 20:9</a>, "I wrought for my Name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen." It is a foreshadowing of that view of all nations, as in some degree having knowledge of God and probation before Him, which is afterwards worked out fully in the prophetic writings. The intense and powerful Monotheism of the religion of Israel, in spite of all its backslidings, could hardly have been without influence over the neighbouring nations (see <a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm" title="And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a blessing of your servant.">2Kings 5:15</a>), especially at a time when the remembrance of Solomon's vast empire, and still wider influence, would yet linger through the tenacious traditions of the East. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came a man of God</span> [Whether this is the same person as the "prophet" of vers. 13, 22, is not quite clear.
