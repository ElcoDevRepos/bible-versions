King David is old and frail, and the succession of the throne is uncertain. Nathan the prophet is speaking to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, about approaching King David to ensure Solomon's succession. The urgency in Nathan's plan reflects the political tension and the need for swift action to prevent Adonijah, David's other son, from seizing the throne. This highlights the importance of divine guidance and prophetic intervention in the leadership of Israel, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>I will come in after you</b><br>Nathan's strategy involves a coordinated effort with Bathsheba to influence King David's decision. This reflects the cultural and historical context where royal decisions were often influenced by close advisors and family members. The role of prophets like Nathan was crucial in guiding the king according to God's will. This also underscores the theme of divine providence working through human actions, a recurring theme in the biblical narrative.<p><b>and confirm your words.&#8221;</b><br>Nathan's promise to confirm Bathsheba's words emphasizes the importance of establishing truth and legitimacy in the royal court. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the testimony of multiple witnesses was often required to confirm a matter, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>. This reflects the biblical principle of establishing truth through the testimony of two or three witnesses, which is echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a>). Nathan's role as a prophet also points to the need for divine confirmation in matters of leadership and succession, prefiguring the ultimate confirmation of Jesus Christ as the rightful King and Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The wife of King David and mother of Solomon.

Bath-sheba's entrance into the bedchamber seems to be looked upon as an intrusion, to be ventured upon only in the humble attitude of a suppliant. Nathan does not presume to approach the king with remonstrance, till the maternal anxiety of Bath-sheba has paved the way.
