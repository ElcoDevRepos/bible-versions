Sacrifices of oxen, calves, and sheep were typical in royal and religious ceremonies, symbolizing wealth and the ability to provide abundantly. The act of sacrificing animals was deeply rooted in the cultural and religious practices of the time, often associated with covenant-making and thanksgiving. The abundance of the sacrifice suggests an attempt to gain support and legitimacy, possibly reflecting the political maneuvering of Adonijah as he sought to establish his claim to the throne.<p><b>and has invited all the other sons of the king</b><br>Adonijah's invitation to all the other sons of King David, except Solomon, highlights the political strategy of consolidating support among potential rivals. By including David's other sons, Adonijah aimed to present a united front and gain legitimacy. This move reflects the complex dynamics of royal succession in ancient Israel, where the king's sons were often seen as potential heirs. The exclusion of Solomon is significant, as it underscores the tension and rivalry within the royal family, setting the stage for the eventual conflict over the throne.<p><b>as well as Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army</b><br>Abiathar and Joab were influential figures in King David's reign. Abiathar, a priest, had served David faithfully and was a key religious leader, while Joab, as the commander of the army, held significant military power. Their support would have been crucial for Adonijah's claim to the throne, as it would lend both religious and military legitimacy to his cause. The inclusion of these figures indicates Adonijah's strategic efforts to secure the backing of powerful allies, reflecting the importance of religious and military endorsement in ancient Near Eastern politics.<p><b>But he has not invited your servant Solomon</b><br>The exclusion of Solomon from the gathering is a deliberate and telling omission. Solomon, who had been chosen by David and promised the throne, represents the divinely sanctioned line of succession. This phrase highlights the tension and impending conflict between Adonijah and Solomon. The use of "your servant" emphasizes Solomon's loyalty to David and his rightful claim to the throne, as well as the divine favor that would later be affirmed through the prophet Nathan and Bathsheba's intervention. This exclusion sets the stage for the fulfillment of God's promise to David regarding Solomon's kingship, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>, where Solomon is designated as the future king who would build the temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The son of King David who attempts to declare himself king without his father's blessing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The reigning king of Israel, who is unaware of Adonijah's actions at this point.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, whom God has chosen to succeed David as king.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/abiathar_the_priest.htm">Abiathar the Priest</a></b><br>A priest who supports Adonijah's claim to the throne.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, who also supports Adonijah.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sacrifice.htm">The Sacrifice</a></b><br>Adonijah's act of sacrificing cattle, calves, and sheep as part of his self-coronation ceremony.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_human_plans.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Human Plans</a></b><br>Despite Adonijah's efforts, God's plan for Solomon to be king prevails.

Here, Adonijah&#8217;s &#8220;abundance&#8221; is a political showpiece meant to legitimize his grasp at the throne (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Such extravagance mimics how kings celebrated coronations (<a href="/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a>), yet it lacks God&#8217;s endorsement. A form of godliness without obedience recalls Saul&#8217;s empty offerings (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This verse reminds us that outward religion, even when impressive, can mask self-promotion (<a href="/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and has invited all the other sons of the king</b><p>&#8226; By gathering David&#8217;s remaining sons, Adonijah seeks to neutralize rival claims and present a united family front (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/13-29.htm">2 Samuel 13:29</a>&#8212;Amnon&#8217;s feast).<p>&#8226; Absent is any mention of seeking David&#8217;s counsel; instead, Adonijah builds consensus through flattery and feasting (<a href="/proverbs/19-6.htm">Proverbs 19:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The move contrasts with God&#8217;s own pattern of selecting leaders irrespective of birth order (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7, 11</a>&#8211;13).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as well as Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army</b><p>&#8226; Abiathar had long served David faithfully (<a href="/1_samuel/23-6.htm">1 Samuel 23:6</a>), and Joab commanded Israel&#8217;s forces (<a href="/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>). Their presence lends institutional weight to Adonijah&#8217;s cause.<p>&#8226; Yet both men carry blemished records&#8212;Joab with bloodguilt (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>; 20:10) and Abiathar later stripped of office for siding with Adonijah (<a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; Their alliance shows how personal ambition can eclipse discernment; they back the wrong candidate despite decades of witnessing God&#8217;s faithfulness to David and his promised line (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But he has not invited your servant Solomon</b><p>&#8226; The deliberate snub exposes Adonijah&#8217;s awareness that Solomon is God&#8217;s choice (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9&#8211;10</a>) and David&#8217;s public pledge (<a href="/1_kings/1-13.htm">1 Kings 1:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Excluding Solomon undercuts any appearance of open legitimacy; Adonijah orchestrates a coronation in secrecy, echoing Absalom&#8217;s earlier conspiracy (<a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse highlights providence: human scheming cannot overturn divine decree (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10&#8211;11</a>).
