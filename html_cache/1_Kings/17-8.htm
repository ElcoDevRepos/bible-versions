Elijah is introduced in <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a> as a prophet who speaks directly for God, and this phrase indicates a divine communication that guides his actions. The phrase "the word of the LORD" is a common biblical expression denoting a direct revelation or command from God, emphasizing the authority and divine origin of the message.<br><br>*Historical and Cultural Context:* Elijah's ministry occurs during a time of great apostasy in Israel, as King Ahab and Queen Jezebel have led the nation into the worship of Baal. This context of idolatry and spiritual decline sets the stage for Elijah's prophetic mission, which often involves confronting the false worship and calling the people back to the covenant with Yahweh.<br><br>*Connections to Other Scripture:* The phrase "the word of the LORD came" is used throughout the Old Testament to describe how God communicates with His prophets (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>). This establishes a pattern of divine-human interaction where God initiates contact with His chosen messengers to deliver His will to the people.<br><br>*Prophecy and Types of Jesus Christ:* Elijah is often seen as a type of Christ, a forerunner who prepares the way for the Lord. Just as Elijah receives the word of the LORD to guide his actions, Jesus is described in the New Testament as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), embodying the ultimate revelation of God to humanity. Elijah's role as a prophet who challenges the status quo and calls for repentance foreshadows the ministry of Jesus, who also confronts religious leaders and calls people to turn back to God.<br><br>*Geographical and Archaeological Insights:* While this specific phrase does not mention a location, Elijah's ministry takes place in the northern kingdom of Israel, which was often at odds with the southern kingdom of Judah. Understanding the geographical division of the kingdoms helps contextualize the political and religious tensions present during Elijah's time. Archaeological findings from sites like Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom, provide insights into the period's cultural and religious practices, further illuminating the challenges Elijah faced.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God, known for his boldness and faithfulness in delivering God's messages during a time of widespread idolatry in Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zarephath.htm">Zarephath</a></b><br>A town in the region of Sidon, outside of Israel, where God sends Elijah to find sustenance during a famine.
