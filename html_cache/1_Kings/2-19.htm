Her approach to Solomon on behalf of Adonijah, who had previously attempted to claim the throne, highlights the complex family dynamics and political intrigue of the time. Bathsheba's involvement underscores her influence and the respect she commanded as the queen mother. This event occurs in the context of Solomon's early reign, where he is consolidating his power and dealing with potential threats to his kingship. The request she carries for Adonijah is politically sensitive, given Adonijah's previous actions.<p><b>The king stood up to greet her,</b><br>Solomon's act of standing to greet Bathsheba is a gesture of respect and honor, reflecting the high status of the queen mother in the royal court. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the queen mother often held a position of considerable influence and authority. Solomon's respect for Bathsheba is consistent with the biblical commandment to honor one's parents (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), and it also demonstrates the importance of family loyalty and respect within the Davidic dynasty.<p><b>bowed to her,</b><br>Bowing to Bathsheba further emphasizes Solomon's respect and reverence for his mother. This act of humility by a king towards his mother is significant, as it illustrates the cultural and familial values of the time. It also sets a precedent for the treatment of the queen mother in the kingdom, highlighting her esteemed position. This gesture can be seen as a reflection of the wisdom and humility that Solomon is known for, as he acknowledges the role and influence of his mother in his life and reign.<p><b>and sat down on his throne.</b><br>Solomon sitting on his throne signifies his authority and the formal setting of the royal court. The throne is a symbol of his kingship and the divine mandate he holds as the ruler of Israel. This moment underscores the legitimacy of Solomon's reign, which was established by divine promise and the support of key figures like Nathan the prophet and Bathsheba. The throne also represents the continuity of David's dynasty, as Solomon fulfills the covenantal promise made to David regarding his descendants.<p><b>Then the king had a throne brought for his mother,</b><br>Providing a throne for Bathsheba signifies her elevated status as the queen mother. In the ancient Near East, the queen mother often held a position of power and influence, sometimes acting as an advisor to the king. This act by Solomon not only honors Bathsheba but also publicly acknowledges her role and authority within the kingdom. It reflects the biblical principle of honoring one's parents and the special place of the mother in the family hierarchy.<p><b>who sat down at his right hand.</b><br>Sitting at the king's right hand is a position of honor and authority, often reserved for the most trusted and esteemed individuals. In biblical symbolism, the right hand is associated with power and favor (<a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>). Bathsheba's placement at Solomon's right hand indicates her significant influence and the trust Solomon places in her. This position can also be seen as a type of the future messianic kingdom, where Jesus Christ, the Son of David, is seated at the right hand of God, signifying His authority and divine favor (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The mother of King Solomon, Bathsheba plays a significant role in the royal court.
