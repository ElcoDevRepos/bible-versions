Biblically, the number three often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus on the third day (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). This waiting period allowed Rehoboam time to consider the counsel he received, reflecting the importance of seeking wisdom and discernment in leadership decisions.<p><b>Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam</b><br>Jeroboam, who had been a servant of Solomon, was a significant figure as he was prophesied to lead the ten tribes of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). His return with "all the people" indicates a collective desire for change and reform. This moment highlights the tension between the northern tribes and the Davidic line, setting the stage for the division of the kingdom. The people's return to Rehoboam underscores their hope for a favorable response to their request for lighter burdens.<p><b>since the king had said, &#8220;Come back to me on the third day.&#8221;</b><br>Rehoboam's instruction to return on the third day shows his initial willingness to consider the people's request, though it ultimately led to a pivotal decision that would divide the kingdom. This reflects the importance of leadership and the consequences of decisions made by those in authority. The king's directive also echoes the biblical theme of testing and waiting, as seen in other scriptural narratives where individuals or groups are called to wait for a divine or authoritative response.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Israel at this time.

Sadly, the counsel he finally chose would fracture the kingdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jeroboam and all the people returned</b><p>&#8226; Jeroboam stood as spokesman for the northern tribes (<a href="/1_kings/12-3.htm">1 Kings 12:3</a>). Their united return signals shared hope that the new king might lighten Solomon&#8217;s burdensome labor and taxation (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene fulfills earlier prophecy: Ahijah had told Jeroboam he would rule ten tribes because of Solomon&#8217;s sin (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29&#8211;31</a>). The people&#8217;s presence with him shows that God&#8217;s word was already steering events toward that outcome.<p>&#8226; Compare Israel&#8217;s earlier corporate approaches to leadership&#8212;Moses (<a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13</a>), Joshua (<a href="/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3&#8211;15</a>)&#8212;to see how communal petitions could shape national destiny.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Rehoboam</b><p>&#8226; Rehoboam, Solomon&#8217;s son, is the legitimate Davidic heir (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>). The people still acknowledge the covenant line by returning to him first, reflecting faithfulness to God&#8217;s promise&#8212;even as their patience will soon be tested.<p>&#8226; This approach sets up the dramatic contrast between the wisdom Solomon once displayed (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9&#8211;12</a>) and the folly Rehoboam is about to reveal (<a href="/1_kings/12-13.htm">1 Kings 12:13&#8211;15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-8.htm">Proverbs 10:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since the king had said</b><p>&#8226; The narrative highlights that the people are honoring their ruler&#8217;s word (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).

Yet the phrasing places the weight of decision solely on him; he cannot blame circumstance or timing.<p>&#8226; By returning as instructed, the people prove their obedience and sincerity, leaving Rehoboam without excuse (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a> required kings to heed God&#8217;s law for the people&#8217;s good).<p>&#8226; The stage is now set for the tragic response in <a href="/1_kings/12-13.htm">1 Kings 12:13&#8211;15</a>, where Rehoboam&#8217;s harshness sparks secession (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/12-12.htm">1 Kings 12:12</a> captures a moment pregnant with possibility: after a purposeful three-day wait, Jeroboam and a hopeful nation assemble before Rehoboam, honoring his request for time. Their obedience and unity highlight the king&#8217;s coming choice. God&#8217;s earlier prophecies thread through the scene, ready to unfold. The verse reminds us that leadership decisions made after seasons of counsel carry covenant-level consequences, proving once more that God&#8217;s word stands sure while human folly can fracture even the strongest kingdoms.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Jeroboam and [LXX. omits] all the people came to Rehoboam the third day</span> ["Three days' expectation had warmed these smoking Israelites" (Hall) ], <span class="cmt_word">as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/12-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After three</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
