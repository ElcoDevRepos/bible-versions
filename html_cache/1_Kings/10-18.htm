Ivory was a luxury material, often imported from distant lands, indicating extensive trade networks. The use of ivory in the throne's construction signifies opulence and the king's ability to access rare resources. Solomon's throne is a symbol of his wisdom and authority, reflecting the prosperity of Israel during his reign. The throne's grandeur can be seen as a foreshadowing of the heavenly throne described in Revelation, where God's majesty is similarly depicted with precious materials.<p><b>and overlaid it with pure gold.</b><br>Gold, a symbol of purity and divinity, was abundant during Solomon's time, as noted in the extensive descriptions of the temple and palace. The overlaying of the throne with pure gold not only emphasizes the wealth of Solomon's kingdom but also serves as a representation of divine favor and blessing. Gold's association with holiness and kingship can be seen throughout scripture, from the tabernacle's furnishings to the gifts brought to Jesus by the Magi.

In <a href="/psalms/45-8.htm" title="All your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made you glad.">Psalm 45:8</a> (presumably of the age of Solomon) we find mention of "ivory palaces," or possibly "caskets." The Tyrians are described in <a href="/ezekiel/27-15.htm" title="The men of Dedan were your merchants; many isles were the merchandise of your hand: they brought you for a present horns of ivory and ebony.">Ezekiel 27:15</a> as receiving it through Dedan in Arabia, whither, no doubt, it came from India. But the Egyptians used ivory largely, drawing it from Africa; and there was, in later times, a port on the Red Sea which was a mart for ivory. The Tyrians may, therefore, have imported it both from India and from Africa. The throne of Solomon was probably inlaid with ivory and gold. Traces of such inlaying are found in Assyrian and Egyptian monuments. It is probable that, like his other architectural and decorative work, it was executed by Tyrian workmen, and the detailed description of it shows how greatly it impressed the imagination of Israel. The lion was the emblem of the house of Judah; the number twelve corresponded to the twelve tribes; and the exaltation of the throne--specially remarkable in a country where men sat commonly on the ground or on cushions--was the emblem of majesty. In the <span class= "ital">Dictionary of the Bible</span> ("THRONE") is given a sketch of an Assyrian throne, from a Nineveh bas-relief, which has horses in the position, supporting "the stays," or arms of the throne, here ascribed to the lions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover the ling made a great throne</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">seat</span>.

And the presumption is that the ivory was solid.
