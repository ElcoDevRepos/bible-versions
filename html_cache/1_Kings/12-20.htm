Previously, he had fled to Egypt to escape King Solomon's wrath (<a href="/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>). His return signifies the fulfillment of the prophecy given by the prophet Ahijah, who had foretold that Jeroboam would rule over ten tribes of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). This event occurs after Solomon's death and during the reign of his son Rehoboam, highlighting the political instability and dissatisfaction among the northern tribes.<p><b>they summoned him to the assembly</b><br>The assembly represents the gathering of the northern tribes, indicating a collective decision-making process. This reflects the tribal confederation system that was prevalent before the monarchy, where leaders were chosen by consensus. The summoning of Jeroboam shows the tribes' desire for a leader who would address their grievances, particularly the heavy burdens imposed by Solomon's administration.<p><b>and made him king over all Israel</b><br>This phrase underscores the division of the united monarchy. Jeroboam's anointing as king over "all Israel" refers to the ten northern tribes, distinct from the southern kingdom of Judah. This division fulfills Ahijah's prophecy and marks the beginning of the separate kingdoms of Israel (the northern kingdom) and Judah (the southern kingdom). The split is a pivotal moment in biblical history, leading to differing destinies for the two kingdoms.<p><b>Only the tribe of Judah followed the house of David</b><br>The loyalty of Judah to the house of David emphasizes the Davidic covenant, where God promised David that his descendants would rule over Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). This loyalty is significant as it maintains the Davidic line through which the Messiah, Jesus Christ, would eventually come (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1-16</a>).

The verse warns of the cost of unfaithfulness and at the same time assures that God&#8217;s redemptive plan, anchored in David&#8217;s line, remains unbroken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Jeroboam was come again.</span>--The assembly at Shechem probably broke up in disorder, carrying everywhere the news of the rebellion. It would be quite in harmony with Jeroboam's astuteness, if, after setting the revolution on foot, he himself stood aloof from leadership, and waited till "the congregation," the duly summoned assembly, sent for him and offered him the crown. The title "king over all Israel" certainly indicates a claim on the part of the ten tribes to be the true Israel, relying perhaps on the prophetic choice and blessing of Jeroboam, and professing to have risen in the name of the Lord against the idolatry of Solomon and his house. Perhaps it also indicated a desire for the subjugation of Judah, which Jeroboam, with the aid of Shishak, certainly seems to have subsequently attempted.<p>(20, 21) In these two verses we have again the same curious juxtaposition of "the tribe of Judah only" and "the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin." The army gathered would be, no doubt, drawn from Solomon's established and disciplined forces, as well as from the levy of Judah and Benjamin generally--perhaps including (as in <a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,">2Samuel 17:27</a>) contingents from the tributary races--who would be attached with a strong personal allegiance to the house of Solomon, and prepared to stamp out the rebellion, before it could thoroughly organise itself for disciplined resistance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again</span> [These words are hardly consistent with the idea that Jeroboam had been from the first the spokesman of "all Israel" in their interviews with Rehoboam.

Probably it was at Shechem, and soon after Rehoboam's flight. After the open and irreparable breach which they had made (ver. 18), the leaders of the tribes would naturally assemble at once to concert measures for their defence and future government], <span class="cmt_word">and made him king</span> [by anointing. Note on ver. 1] <span class="cmt_word">over all Israel</span> [This public and formal consecration of Jeroboam completed the secession of the northern tribes. Was this secession sinful? Bahr, Keil, and others, who start from the assumption that secession was determined upon even before Rehoboam came to Shechem, and that the complaints of the people respecting the grievous service to which they had been subjected by Solomon were groundless, naturally conclude that it was altogether treasonable and unjustifiable. But is this conclusion borne out by the facts? We may readily admit that the schism was not accomplished without sin: we cannot but allow that Israel acted with undue precipitation, and that Rehoboam, who was "young and tenderhearted," was entitled, for David's and Solomon's sake, as well as his own, to greater forbearance and consideration, and it is almost certain that both the "envy of Ephraim" and the ambition of Jeroboam largely influenced the result. At the same time, it is to be remembered that the division of the kingdom was ordained of God, and that the people had just cause of complaint, if not, indeed, sufficient warrant for resistance, in the arbitrary and insolent rejection of their petition by the young king. No law of God requires men to yield themselves up without a struggle to such cruel and abject slavery as Rehoboam threatened these men with. They judged - and who shall say unreasonably? - from his words that they had only tyranny and cruelty to expect at his hands, and what wonder if they stood on their defence? They are only to be blamed because they did more. But lawful resistance not uncommonly ripens into unlawful rebellion]: <span class="cmt_word">there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</span> [This general statement is qualified immediately afterwards (ver. 21). The tribe of Benjamin, "the smallest of the tribes of Israel" (<a href="/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>), "little Benjamin" (<a href="/psalms/68-27.htm">Psalm 68:27</a>), is here omitted as of comparatively small account.
