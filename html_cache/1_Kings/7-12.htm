The inner courtyard was more exclusive, reserved for priests and Levites, symbolizing a closer proximity to God's presence.

Solomon&#8217;s temple complex included a broad outer court that enclosed the entire sacred precinct.<p>&#8226; Physically, this courtyard served as a boundary, setting apart holy space from the common world&#8212;much as God marked off Eden (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>), the wilderness tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/27-9.htm">Exodus 27:9-19</a>), and later the rebuilt temple (<a href="/ezra/6-3.htm">Ezra 6:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, every enclosure God designs reminds His people that He is holy and that access to Him is granted on His terms (<a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By three rows of dressed stone</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Three rows of dressed stone&#8221; emphasizes strength, permanence, and beauty. These stones were cut and smoothed before being set in place (cf. <a href="/1_kings/6-7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>; 5:17).<p>&#8226; The careful workmanship reflects the Lord&#8217;s demand for excellence in things dedicated to Him (<a href="/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>). He is worthy of our best resources and skill (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Israel&#8217;s masons, believers are &#8220;living stones &#8230; built into a spiritual house&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>), prepared by God&#8217;s own hand to fit perfectly into His plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And a row of trimmed cedar beams</b><p>&#8226; Cedar, floated down from Lebanon (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6-9</a>), symbolized majesty and longevity (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>). A top layer of cedar beams capped the stone courses, binding the wall and adding architectural beauty.<p>&#8226; Cedar&#8217;s fragrance naturally resisted rot and insects, underscoring the incorruptibility God desires in His dwelling (<a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-53.htm">1 Corinthians 15:53</a>).<p>&#8226; The blending of stone and wood shows that God delights in variety unified for one purpose&#8212;a picture echoed in the diverse yet harmonized body of Christ (1 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 12</a>:12).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As were the inner courtyard and portico of the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The same construction pattern extended inward: the inner court (where priests ministered) and the portico (the temple&#8217;s front porch) shared identical materials (<a href="/1_kings/6-36.htm">1 Kings 6:36</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/4-9.htm">2 Chronicles 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Consistency from outer court to inner sanctuary teaches that God&#8217;s standards do not lower as we draw nearer; rather, they remain uniformly high (<a href="/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1-2</a>; <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The repeating motif also hints at biblical typology: what is true in the visible, earthly temple foreshadows the heavenly reality (<a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16-17</a>).

For believers today, the verse invites us to honor the Lord with the same intentionality, purity, and unified devotion that marked the temple&#8217;s great courtyard, inner court, and portico.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">The great court.</span>--Finally, "the great court" round about is said to have resembled the "inner court" of the Temple, having an enclosure of three rows of stones, probably of large size, with a cedar coping. It seems evidently to have enclosed the whole palace, and may have contained quarters for the guards and the household. There must have been, of course, inner courts, round which both the more public and the more private buildings of the palace were grouped.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the great court round about</span> [The palace, again like the temple, had two courts. The lesser is referred to in ver. 8, and was enclosed among the buildings. The great court probably surrounded the entire structure] <span class="cmt_word">was</span> [enclosed by a wall] <span class="cmt_word">with three rows of</span> hewed <span class="cmt_word">stones, and a row of cedar beams</span> [The latter formed the coping. The wall of the court of the palace thus resembled that of the temple. See on 1 Kings 6:36. In all these coincidences we have tokens of the same designing hand], <span class="cmt_word">both for the inner court of the house of the Lord.</span> [This sudden digression from the court of the palace to the temple is suspicious, and suggests either a mistranslation or corruption of the text. The historian evidently meant to say that the wall of the court, in its three rows of stones and its cedar coping, resembled the inner court of the temple; and, according to some grammarians (Gesen., Ewald), this meaning may well be conveyed by the text as it stands, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> in Hebrew serving sometimes to institute a comparison (<a href="/proverbs/25-3.htm">Proverbs 25:3, 12, 20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/26-14.htm">Proverbs 26:14</a>, etc.) "As in the court," etc. But the instances just cited, being proverbs or apophthegms, are not strictly parallel with our text. It seems better, on the whole, however, to retain the text in this sense than to replace. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> by <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span>, reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d7;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d4;&#x5d7;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;</span> (Horsley) is quite inadmissible, as the constr, case never has the art.], <span class="cmt_word">and for the porch of the house.</span> [It is almost impossible to decide whether the porch of judgment (ver. 7) or the porch of the temple is here meant. The immediate context favours the latter. But this does not seem to have had any court or enclosing wall other than the inner court. Rawlinson decides for the porch of judgment, "which," he says, "had a planking of cedar over the stone pavement" (ver. 7). But ver. 7 (where see note) rather excludes than in-eludes the pavement. The reference is probably to the "court within the porch," mentioned in ver. 8.] After this brief account of the royal palaces, the author proceeds to mention the vessels, etc., used in the temple service, prefacing his description by a few words respecting the great Tyrian artist, by whom they were for the most part cast, and possibly designed also. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/7-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The great</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
