In ancient Near Eastern architecture, the use of such stones was a common practice for significant structures, symbolizing strength, durability, and the wealth of the builder. The choice of materials reflects the resources available to Solomon, as well as the alliances he had formed, such as with Hiram of Tyre, who provided skilled labor and materials. This also echoes the construction of the Temple itself, which was built with the finest materials, as described in <a href="/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>, where large stones were quarried for the foundation.<p><b>some ten cubits long and some eight cubits long</b><br>A cubit is generally considered to be about 18 inches or 45 centimeters, making these stones approximately 15 feet (4.5 meters) and 12 feet (3.6 meters) long, respectively. The specific mention of the dimensions highlights the impressive scale and precision involved in the construction. This attention to detail and the use of such massive stones would have required significant manpower and expertise, indicating the advanced engineering skills of the time. The use of large stones is reminiscent of other biblical structures, such as the stones used in the construction of the altar in <a href="/joshua/4-20.htm">Joshua 4:20</a>, which also served as a memorial to God's provision and faithfulness. The precision and care in laying these stones can be seen as a reflection of the divine order and stability that the Temple was meant to represent, pointing to the eternal and unshakeable nature of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple and his palace.

Solomon&#8217;s builders did not begin with shortcuts; they began with substance (see <a href="/1_kings/6-37.htm">1 Kings 6:37&#8211;38</a>, where the temple&#8217;s foundation work alone took an entire year).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, a solid foundation is a divine priority: &#8220;See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>). Jesus echoes the theme when He speaks of the wise man who builds on rock (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the verse invites us to consider what lies beneath our visible lives. Like Solomon, we are called to start with what is firm, lasting, and God-ordained (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with large, costly stones</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;At the king&#8217;s command they quarried large, costly stones to lay the foundation of the temple&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>). These were not scrap materials; they were premium, painstakingly prepared blocks.<p>&#8226; Costliness signals value&#8212;nothing about God&#8217;s house was ordinary. <a href="/mark/13-1.htm">Mark 13:1</a> records the disciples&#8217; awe at the temple&#8217;s &#8220;massive stones,&#8221; showing that centuries later the scale and expense still impressed onlookers.<p>&#8226; Spiritual takeaway: devotion to God involves giving Him our best (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>). If Solomon honored the Lord with expensive stones, how much more should we offer our hearts, time, and resources without reservation (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>some ten cubits long</b><p>&#8226; Ten cubits equals roughly fifteen feet (4.5 m). Stones of that length underline stability: long, single pieces resist shifting better than smaller blocks.<p>&#8226; Measurements in Scripture often highlight perfection and completeness (<a href="/genesis/6-15.htm">Genesis 6:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-47.htm">Ezekiel 40:47</a>). Here, the sheer size points to permanence&#8212;God&#8217;s dwelling was meant to endure.<p>&#8226; Think of the &#8220;living stones&#8221; in <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>. Whether large or small, each member of Christ&#8217;s body contributes to a structure designed for eternity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and some eight cubits long</b><p>&#8226; Eight-cubit stones (about twelve feet, 3.6 m) show variety within uniform excellence. The builders chose the length that best fit each section, demonstrating order and intentionality (<a href="/1_kings/6-7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>, where stones were finished at the quarry so no hammer was heard on site).<p>&#8226; Similar diversity exists in the church: &#8220;The body is not one part but many&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-14.htm">1 Corinthians 12:14</a>). God shapes every believer for a specific place in His plan, yet all fit together seamlessly (<a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; The alternation between ten- and eight-cubit blocks may also reflect beauty through pattern&#8212;God is both architect and artist.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/7-10.htm">1 Kings 7:10</a> showcases the invisible strength beneath Solomon&#8217;s palace complex: massive, precious stones carefully sized and set. The verse teaches that what supports our lives must be solid, costly by heaven&#8217;s standards, and purposefully arranged. Just as those foundational blocks bore the weight of royal halls, so the Lord Himself&#8212;and the truths of His Word&#8212;must carry the full weight of our faith, service, and daily choices.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones</span> [Bahr says, "Even the foundations which from without were not seen, were composed of these great stones."
