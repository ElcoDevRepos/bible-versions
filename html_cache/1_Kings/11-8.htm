This phrase highlights Solomon's accommodation of his wives' religious practices, which was contrary to the command in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>, warning against intermarriage with foreign nations to prevent idolatry. Solomon's marriages were often political alliances, common in the ancient Near East, but they led to spiritual compromise. This action foreshadows the division of the kingdom after Solomon's reign, as his heart was turned away from God.<p><b>who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods</b><br>The burning of incense and offering sacrifices were integral parts of ancient religious practices, signifying devotion and worship. These acts were performed by Solomon's wives to their native deities, such as Ashtoreth, Milcom, and Chemosh, as mentioned earlier in the chapter. This practice was in direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>), which emphasized the worship of Yahweh alone. The presence of these foreign religious practices in Israel contributed to the spiritual decline of the nation and set a precedent for future kings who would also lead the people into idolatry. This situation contrasts with the typology of Christ, who remained faithful and obedient to God, fulfilling the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). Solomon's failure serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of syncretism and the importance of maintaining fidelity to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.

he duplicated it every place a wife desired (cf. <a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier God had blessed Solomon with wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>), yet wisdom unused turns into folly (<a href="/ecclesiastes/10-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:1</a>).<p>&#8226;
