In the context of the Old Testament, God often communicated directly with key figures, such as Moses and David, to guide His people. This divine interaction underscores the importance of Solomon's request and God's approval of it.<p><b>Since you have asked for this</b><br>Solomon's request was for wisdom, specifically discernment to govern the people. This reflects his humility and recognition of the immense responsibility of leading Israel. It aligns with the biblical principle that God values a heart that seeks wisdom and understanding over material wealth or personal gain.<p><b>instead of requesting long life or wealth for yourself</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern cultures, kings often sought longevity and prosperity as signs of divine favor and successful reign. Solomon's choice to prioritize wisdom over these common desires demonstrates a selfless approach to leadership, valuing the well-being of his people over personal gain. This choice is reminiscent of Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>, where seeking God's kingdom and righteousness is prioritized over worldly concerns.<p><b>or death for your enemies</b><br>In the historical context of Israel, surrounded by hostile nations, a king might naturally desire the defeat of his enemies to secure peace and stability. Solomon's decision not to ask for the death of his enemies reflects a commitment to peace and justice, aligning with the biblical theme of loving one's enemies and seeking reconciliation, as later taught by Jesus in the New Testament.<p><b>but you have asked for discernment to administer justice</b><br>This request highlights Solomon's desire to be a just ruler, which is central to the biblical understanding of a good king. The Hebrew concept of justice (mishpat) involves fairness, righteousness, and the protection of the vulnerable. Solomon's request is a foreshadowing of the messianic king, Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect wisdom and justice. Solomon's wisdom is later demonstrated in the famous judgment involving two women claiming to be the mother of a child, showcasing his God-given ability to discern truth and administer justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the newly anointed king of Israel.

All these secondary blessings are good, just so far as they conduce to the supreme good, which is the growth of the human nature, by the knowledge of God and by faithfully doing His work on earth, to the perfection designed for it in His wisdom. So long as Solomon used them in subordination to true wisdom, they were a blessing to him; when he made them idols, they became a curse. The connection of these lower gifts with the moral and intellectual gifts of wisdom, is the result of the natural law of God's Providence, so far as that law overcomes the resistance of evil and folly, still allowed to strive against it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God said unto him.
