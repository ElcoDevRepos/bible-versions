Solomon's role as king and builder of the Temple fulfills the promise God made to David regarding his lineage and the establishment of a house for God's name (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>).<p><b>The LORD has said:</b><br>This phrase indicates that Solomon is referencing a divine promise or statement. It reflects the importance of God's word and His faithfulness to His promises. Throughout the Old Testament, God communicates His will and intentions through prophets and leaders, emphasizing the authority and reliability of His word (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><b>that He would dwell:</b><br>The concept of God dwelling among His people is central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The Tabernacle, and later the Temple, served as the physical manifestation of God's presence. This dwelling is not limited to a physical structure but signifies God's desire to be in communion with His people (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>).<p><b>in the thick cloud:</b><br>The thick cloud symbolizes God's glory and presence, often associated with divine revelation and protection. In <a href="/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>, God descends on Mount Sinai in a thick cloud to speak with Moses, signifying His holiness and the mystery of His presence. The cloud also represents God's guidance and protection during the Israelites' journey in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). This imagery foreshadows the New Testament revelation of God dwelling among humanity through Jesus Christ, who is described as the light of the world (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.

He refers to the frequent declarations made in old time that the cloud is the symbol of God's indwelling presence (such as <a href="/exodus/19-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, See, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.">Exodus 19:9</a>, and <a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat, which is on the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.">Leviticus 16:2</a>);<p>he recognises in the appearance of the cloud the sign that the Divine presence is granted to the Temple; and accordingly he exults in the proof that his foreordained work is accomplished by the building of a house, a "settled habitation" for the Lord. The description of the cloud as "thick darkness," in no way contradicts the idea of the glory shining through it; for human eyes are easily "darkened by excess of light." This mingled light and darkness symbolises--perhaps more strikingly than even the literal darkness of the Most Holy Place--the mystery which veils the presence of God, known to be, and to be infinitely glorious, but in its nature incomprehensible.<p>Thenius, from a single Chaldee version, suggests for "thick darkness" the correction "Jerusalem;" dwelling on the closer harmony of the reading with <a href="/1_kings/8-16.htm" title="Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.">1Kings 8:16</a>, quoting the promise of <a href="/context/psalms/132-13.htm" title="For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his habitation.">Psalm 132:13-14</a> (closely connected there with the great promise of David), and urging the likelihood of the citation of this promise by Solomon, and the greater simplicity thus given to his whole utterance. The suggestion is ingenious; but it lacks authority, both external and internal. The LXX., in the Alexandrine MS. (for the Vatican MS. omits the whole), and the Vulg. agree with the Hebrew text; and Josephus, though he gives a verbose paraphrase of the prayer, evidently had our reading before him, for he contrasts the mystery and ubiquity of the Divine presence with the material shrine. Nor is it easy to conceive how from a passage so simple and prosaic, as this would be with the reading "Jerusalem," the more difficult, but far more striking, reading of the present text could have arisen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> <span class="cmt_word">spake Solomon</span> [in a transport of emotion at the sight.
