Solomon's authority as king is emphasized here, as he is making a decisive judgment. This reflects the king's role as a judge and enforcer of justice, a theme prevalent throughout the books of Kings.<p><b>&#8220;Do just as he says.</b><br>Solomon is instructing Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, to carry out a specific action. This reflects the king's reliance on trusted officials to execute his commands. The phrase underscores the importance of obedience to the king's orders, a principle that is echoed in the broader biblical narrative regarding obedience to God's commands.<p><b>Strike him down and bury him,</b><br>This command refers to the execution of Joab, who had sought asylum at the altar. The act of striking down and burying signifies both the execution of justice and the removal of guilt from the land. In ancient Israel, the shedding of blood required atonement, and burial was a way to honorably dispose of the body, even of a criminal. This reflects the biblical principle of justice and the seriousness of bloodshed.<p><b>and so remove from me and from the house of my father</b><br>Solomon seeks to cleanse himself and his dynasty from the guilt associated with Joab's actions. The "house of my father" refers to the Davidic dynasty, which Solomon is keen to protect from the stain of innocent blood. This highlights the importance of maintaining a legacy free from guilt and the divine mandate for kings to uphold justice.<p><b>the innocent blood that Joab shed.</b><br>Joab had killed Abner and Amasa, both of whom were considered innocent. This act of shedding innocent blood was a serious offense in Israelite law, as it defiled the land and required justice. The reference to "innocent blood" connects to the broader biblical theme of justice and the sanctity of life, as well as the need for atonement and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the king of Israel at this time.

Possibly because the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of <a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a> seemed to Solomon to require it. Both Bahr and Keil think it was that Joab's services to the kingdom might be requited with an honourable sepulture. Was it not rather that the corpse might be removed with all possible haste from the sanctuary, which it defiled, and hidden from view, as one accursed of God, in the earth?

Solomon evidently believed that the guilt of blood was upon him and his house so long as Abner's and Amasa's blood remained unavenged ("The blood that is not required from the murderer will be required from the magistrate." Henry), and that he and his seed might have to answer for it, as Saul's seed had done (<a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1, 9</a>). This is one of the many considerations which show that both David and Solomon were actuated not by "cold-blooded vengeance" or "long-cherished resentment" (Stanley), but by a sense of duty. In fact, Jewish law imperatively demanded the death of Joab, and to spare him was to violate all law, and to imperil the throne and the people. "Only a superficial observer," says Ewald, "can here reproach Solomon with needless severity."] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/2-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
