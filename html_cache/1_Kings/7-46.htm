The use of clay molds for casting indicates a sophisticated metallurgical process for the time, reflecting the advanced craftsmanship and resources available during Solomon's reign. This method allowed for detailed and intricate designs, which were essential for the grandeur of the temple. The use of clay molds is consistent with ancient Near Eastern practices, where clay was a common material for creating molds due to its availability and ease of shaping.<p><b>in the plain of the Jordan</b><br>The plain of the Jordan refers to the area surrounding the Jordan River, a significant geographical feature in Israel. This location was chosen likely due to its proximity to water, which was necessary for the casting process, and the availability of clay and other natural resources. The Jordan River valley was a fertile and resource-rich area, making it an ideal location for such large-scale industrial activities. This setting also underscores the logistical planning involved in Solomon's temple construction, as materials and labor had to be coordinated over significant distances.<p><b>between Succoth and Zarethan</b><br>Succoth and Zarethan were towns located in the Jordan Valley. Succoth is mentioned in <a href="/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a> as a place where Jacob built a house and made shelters for his livestock. Zarethan is referenced in <a href="/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a> in the context of the Israelites crossing the Jordan River. The mention of these locations provides a specific geographical context, indicating the precise area where the casting took place. This region was strategically chosen for its resources and accessibility.

As Zarthan was almost certainly west of the Jordan, and as the casting - from the nature of the country - must as certainly have been done to the west of the river it is somewhat surprising to find a trans-Jordanie town mentioned as one of the landmarks defining the site.
