Ahab was known for his idolatry and alliance with Jezebel, which led Israel into sin. Jehoshaphat, on the other hand, was a king who sought to follow the ways of the Lord, though he made alliances that were sometimes questionable. This interaction highlights the political alliances of the time, where kingdoms would often join forces for military campaigns.<p><b>&#8220;I will disguise myself and go into battle,</b><br>Ahab's decision to disguise himself reveals his fear and lack of trust in God's protection. This act of self-preservation contrasts with the typical role of a king leading his troops visibly. It also reflects Ahab's awareness of the prophecy given by Micaiah, which foretold disaster for him. Disguising oneself in battle was not uncommon in ancient warfare, as leaders were prime targets.<p><b>but you wear your royal robes.&#8221;</b><br>Ahab's instruction to Jehoshaphat to wear his royal robes is significant. It suggests a willingness to put Jehoshaphat in harm's way, possibly to divert attention from himself. This request can be seen as manipulative, highlighting Ahab's character. In contrast, Jehoshaphat's compliance may indicate his trust or naivety, as well as the cultural expectation for a king to be visibly present in battle.<p><b>So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.</b><br>Ahab's actions fulfill his plan to avoid recognition. This decision ultimately leads to his downfall, as it demonstrates a lack of faith and reliance on human strategy over divine guidance. The narrative foreshadows the fulfillment of Micaiah's prophecy, as Ahab's attempt to thwart God's word proves futile. This event underscores the biblical theme that God's will cannot be thwarted by human schemes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel (Ahab)</a></b><br>Ahab was the king of Israel, known for his idolatry and opposition to the prophets of God.

In itself it is, of course, plainly absurd to believe that God's judgment has in all probability been pronounced, and yet to suppose that it can be averted by so puerile a precaution. But, as experience shows, it is not the less on that account true to human nature, especially such a nature as his, always "halting between two opinions."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoahaphat</span> [At Ramoth-Gilead, on the eve of the battle], <span class="cmt_word">I will disguise himself."</span> [same word <a href="/1_kings/20-38.htm">1 Kings 20:38</a>] <span class="cmt_word">and enter</span> [The margin," when he was to disguise himself," etc., is quite mistaken.

It is hardly likely that such intelligence could be brought by spies, and there would be no deserters from the Syrian army to that of the Jews. It is enough to remember that Micaiah's words, "these have no master," could not fail to awaken come alarm in his bosom, especially when connected with the prophecy of <a href="/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>. He will not betray his fear by keeping out of the fray - which, indeed, he could not do without abdicating one of the principal functions of the king (<a href="/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>), and without exposing himself to the charge of cowardice; but under the circumstances he thinks it imprudent to take the lead of the army, as kings were wont to do (<a href="/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a>), in his royal robes. He hopes by his disguise to escape all clanger]: <span class="cmt_word">but put thou on thy robes</span> [LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. "<span class="accented">My robed"</span> "We can neither imagine Ahab's asking nor Jehoshaphat's consenting to such a procedure. Jehoshaphat had his own royal robes with him, as appears from ver. 10" (Rawlinson). If this LXX. interpretation could be maintained it would lend some colour to the supposition, otherwise destitute of basis, that Ahab by this arrangement was plotting the death of Jehoshaphat in order that he might incorporate Judah into his own kingdom. It is clear, however, that Ahab then had other work on his hands, and it is doubtful whether even he was capable of such a pitch of villainy. What he means is, either <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the Syrians have a personal enmity against himself (ver. 81), whereas they could have none against the king of Judah; or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Jehoshaphat's life had not been threatened as his own had.
