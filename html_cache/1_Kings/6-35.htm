Cherubim are often associated with the presence and holiness of God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> and <a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>, where they guard the way to the Tree of Life and are part of the Ark of the Covenant. Palm trees symbolize victory and peace, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a> and <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where they are used in celebrations and heavenly visions. Open flowers may represent beauty and the flourishing of creation, echoing the Garden of Eden's lushness. These elements together create a visual representation of divine presence and the ideal of paradise restored.<p><b>and he overlaid them with gold</b><br>The overlaying of gold signifies the temple's opulence and the value placed on worship. Gold is a symbol of purity, divinity, and kingship, often used in the tabernacle and temple furnishings (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>, <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>). This reflects the glory and majesty of God, as well as the wealth and wisdom of Solomon's reign. The use of gold also points to the heavenly city described in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>, where the streets are made of pure gold, indicating the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingdom.<p><b>hammered evenly over the carvings</b><br>The technique of hammering gold evenly over the carvings demonstrates the skill and care involved in the temple's construction. This meticulous craftsmanship highlights the importance of offering the best to God, as seen in the detailed instructions for the tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-11</a>. The even overlay ensures that the beauty of the carvings is enhanced, not obscured, symbolizing how God's glory perfects and completes creation. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who fulfills and perfects the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>), bringing God's presence to humanity in a tangible way.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem.
