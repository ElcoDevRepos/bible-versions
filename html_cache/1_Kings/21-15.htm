Her influence over Ahab led to the promotion of idolatry in Israel. The stoning of Naboth was a result of Jezebel's manipulation and misuse of power, reflecting the corruption and moral decay in the kingdom. Stoning was a method of execution prescribed in the Mosaic Law for certain offenses, but in this case, it was a perversion of justice. This event highlights the theme of injustice and the abuse of authority, which is condemned throughout Scripture.<p><b>she said to Ahab, &#8220;Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite</b><br>Jezebel's command to Ahab to take possession of Naboth's vineyard demonstrates her disregard for God's laws regarding property and inheritance. According to Levitical law, land was to remain within the family and tribe to which it was allotted (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>). Naboth's refusal to sell his vineyard was an act of obedience to God's command. Jezebel's actions show a blatant violation of these divine principles, emphasizing the conflict between pagan practices and the covenantal laws of Israel.<p><b>who refused to give it to you for silver</b><br>Naboth's refusal to sell his vineyard to Ahab was based on his adherence to the law and his respect for his ancestral heritage. This refusal is significant as it underscores the importance of faithfulness to God's commandments over material gain. Naboth's integrity contrasts sharply with the greed and covetousness displayed by Ahab and Jezebel. This narrative serves as a reminder of the spiritual battle between righteousness and wickedness.<p><b>For Naboth is no longer alive, but dead.&#8221;</b><br>The death of Naboth marks a turning point in the narrative, as it sets the stage for divine retribution. The unjust killing of Naboth is a grave sin that calls for God's judgment. This event foreshadows the eventual downfall of Ahab and Jezebel, as prophesied by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19-24</a>). It also serves as a type of Christ, as Naboth, an innocent man, suffers death at the hands of corrupt authorities, prefiguring the unjust trial and crucifixion of Jesus. The story of Naboth is a powerful illustration of the consequences of sin and the certainty of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezebel.htm">Jezebel</a></b><br>The wife of King Ahab, known for her idolatry and manipulation.
