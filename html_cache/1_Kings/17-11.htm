The widow of Zarephath, a Gentile living in Phoenicia, is gathering sticks to prepare a final meal for herself and her son. Her willingness to go and fetch water for Elijah, a stranger, demonstrates hospitality and obedience, which were highly valued in ancient Near Eastern culture. This act of service foreshadows her faith and the miraculous provision that will follow.<p><b>he called to her and said</b><br>Elijah's calling to the widow signifies a divine appointment. Prophets often acted as God's messengers, and Elijah's interaction with the widow is a demonstration of God's concern for individuals, regardless of their nationality or status. This moment highlights the importance of listening to God's voice and being open to His guidance, even in unexpected circumstances.<p><b>&#8220;Please bring me a piece of bread.&#8221;</b><br>Elijah's request for bread is significant given the context of famine. Bread, a staple food, symbolizes sustenance and life. This request tests the widow's faith and willingness to trust in God's provision. The narrative parallels the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16) and foreshadows Jesus' teaching on God providing for our needs (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>). Elijah's request also prefigures Christ, who is the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), offering spiritual sustenance to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who is central to this account.
