In the context of Solomon's dedication of the temple, it reflects the understanding that while God is not confined to the temple, He is attentive to the prayers offered there. This aligns with <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>, which states, "The LORD is in His holy temple; the LORD is on His heavenly throne." It underscores the transcendence of God, who is both immanent and sovereign over all creation.<p><b>their prayer and their plea</b><br>The distinction between "prayer" and "plea" suggests different forms of communication with God. "Prayer" can be seen as a general term for speaking with God, while "plea" indicates a more urgent or desperate request. This reflects the human condition of dependence on divine intervention, as seen in the Psalms, where David often cries out to God in times of distress (e.g., <a href="/psalms/86-6.htm">Psalm 86:6</a>). It highlights the relational aspect of faith, where believers are encouraged to bring all concerns before God.<p><b>and may You uphold their cause</b><br>This phrase speaks to God's role as a just judge who supports the righteous. The request for God to "uphold their cause" implies a desire for divine justice and vindication. In the historical context, Israel often faced external threats and internal disputes, necessitating divine intervention for protection and justice. This is reminiscent of God's promise in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>, "For the LORD will vindicate His people." It also foreshadows the ultimate justice brought by Jesus Christ, who is described as the righteous judge in <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who is offering this prayer during the dedication of the temple.

Same words, <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>; cf. <a href="/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5</a>, Heb.] The last petition - the second of those which speak of prayers addressed towards the temple, or the Holy Presence which dwelt there, from a foreign land - contemplates as possible the captivity of the Hebrew nation. It has hence been too readily inferred that this portion of the prayer, at least, if not the preceding petition also, has been interpolated by a post-captivity writer. But there is really no solid reason for doubting its genuineness. Not only is it the <span class="accented">seventh</span> petition (see on ver. 31), but the captivity of Israel had been denounced as the punishment of persistent disobedience long before by Moses, and in the chapters to which such constant reference is made (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33, 44</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25, 36, 64</a>; cf. 4:27) - a fact which is in itself an indirect proof of genuineness, as showing that this petition is of a piece with the rest of the prayer. And when to this we add that the carrying of a conquered and refractory race into captivity was an established custom of the East, we shall be inclined to agree with Bahr, that "it would have been more remarkable if Solomon had not mentioned it." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/8-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">may You hear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;ma&#8216;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
