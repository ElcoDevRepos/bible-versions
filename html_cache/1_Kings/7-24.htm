This level of detail underscores the importance of the Temple as a place of divine presence and worship.<p><b>cast in two rows</b><br>The casting of the ornamental buds in two rows suggests a structured and orderly design, which is a recurring theme in the construction of the Temple. This orderliness reflects the divine order and harmony that the Temple was meant to embody. The use of casting, a process involving molten metal, indicates advanced metallurgical techniques of the time.<p><b>as a part of the Sea</b><br>The "Sea" refers to the large bronze basin used for ritual purification by the priests.
