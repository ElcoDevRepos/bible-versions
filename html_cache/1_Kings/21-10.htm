The term "scoundrels" indicates men of low character, willing to bear false witness. This reflects the moral decay and corruption present in the kingdom under Ahab and Jezebel's rule. The use of false witnesses is reminiscent of the trial of Jesus, where false testimony was also used to condemn Him (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55-59</a>).<p><b>and have them testify,</b><br>The act of testifying in a legal setting was a serious matter in Israelite society, as it was believed that witnesses were accountable to God for their words. The manipulation of this process by Jezebel highlights the abuse of power and the perversion of justice. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s concern for justice and truth, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>, where false witness is listed among the things the Lord detests.<p><b>&#8216;You have cursed both God and the king!&#8217;</b><br>Blasphemy against God and treason against the king were both capital offenses in ancient Israel. The accusation of cursing God was particularly serious, as it was seen as a direct affront to the divine authority and holiness of God (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). The charge of cursing the king reflects the political dimension of the accusation, as it was intended to secure the king's interest in the matter. This dual accusation ensured that Naboth would be condemned by both religious and civil authorities.<p><b>Then take him out and stone him to death.&#8221;</b><br>Stoning was a common method of execution for serious offenses in ancient Israel, as prescribed in the Law (<a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/17-5.htm">Deuteronomy 17:5</a>). It was a communal act, symbolizing the collective judgment of the community against the offender. The phrase "take him out" indicates that the execution was to occur outside the city, maintaining the purity of the community space. This method of execution is also seen in the New Testament with the stoning of Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>), drawing a parallel between the unjust treatment of Naboth and the early Christian martyrs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naboth.htm">Naboth</a></b><br>A Jezreelite who owned a vineyard that King Ahab desired.

By arranging false witnesses, leveling the gravest possible charges, removing Naboth from the city, and stoning him, Jezebel corrupts every step of due process. Yet the account also affirms that the Lord sees, records, and repays; no miscarriage of justice escapes His notice. The verse therefore warns against complicity in evil, underscores the sanctity of truthful testimony, and assures believers that God&#8217;s righteous judgment will ultimately vindicate the wronged.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Two men</span>--in accordance with <a href="/numbers/35-30.htm" title="Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.">Numbers 35:30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-6.htm" title="At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Sons of Belial.</span>--See <a href="/judges/19-22.htm" title="Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into your house, that we may know him.">Judges 19:22</a>; <a href="/judges/20-13.htm" title="Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.

"Even Jezebel bears witness to the Pentateuch" (Wordsworth). Josephus speaks of <span class="accented">three</span> witnesses], <span class="cmt_word">sons of Belial</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, worthless men. This use of the word "son" (cf. <a href="/psalms/89-22.htm">Psalm 89:22</a>, "son of wickedness"), which is one of the commonest idioms of the East, throws some light on the expression "sons of the prophets" (see <a href="/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35</a>, note; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-60.htm">Matthew 26:60</a>)], <span class="cmt_word">before him</span> [confronting him], <span class="cmt_word">to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">bless</span>; cf. <a href="/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5, 11</a>; <a href="/job/2-5.htm">Job 2:5</a>; LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. The Lexicographers are not agreed as to how this word, the primary meaning of which is to <span class="accented">kneel</span>, hence to <span class="accented">pray</span>, to <span class="accented">bless</span>, came to signify <span class="accented">curse</span> or <span class="accented">blaspheme</span>. According to some, it is an euphemism, the idea of cursing God being altogether too horrible for the Jew to express in words; whilst others derive this signification from the fact that a curse is really a <span class="accented">prayer</span> addressed to God; and others, again, account for it by the consideration that a person who <span class="accented">bids</span> <span class="accented">farewell</span> to another sometimes does so in the sense of dismissing and cursing him. Anyhow, it is noticeable that the word "blessing" is sometimes used with a similar meaning amongst ourselves] <span class="cmt_word">God and the king</span> [God and the representative of God in Israel are here coupled together, as in <a href="/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a>. To curse the king was practically to curse Him whose vicegerent he was (cf. <a href="/matthew/23-18.htm">Matthew 23:18-22</a>). Hence such cursing is called blasphemy and was punishable with death (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-11.htm">Deuteronomy 13:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-5.htm">Deuteronomy 17:5</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-9.htm">2 Samuel 16:9</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-21.htm">2 Samuel 19:21</a>; and see on 1 Kings 2:43, 44)]. <span class="cmt_word">And then carry him out</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, out of the city (cf. <a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>; <a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>; <a href="/luke/4-29.htm">Luke 4:29</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>). "<span class="accented">Locus</span> <span class="accented">lapidationis erat extra urbem, omnes enim civitates muris cinctae paritatem habent ad castra Israelis"</span> (Babyl. Sanh.)], <span class="cmt_word">and stone him</span> [the legal punishment for blasphemy (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>)], <span class="cmt_word">that he may die</span>. [The terrible power accorded to "two or three witnesses," of denouncing a man to death, accounts for the prominence given to the sin of bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-16.htm">Deuteronomy 19:16</a>).
