This division occurred due to Rehoboam's harsh policies, which led to the northern tribes rebelling and forming their own kingdom under Jeroboam. The split fulfilled the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). Rehoboam's reign marks the beginning of the divided monarchy, a significant period in Israel's history.<p><b>He was forty-one years old when he became king,</b><br>Rehoboam's age at ascension suggests he was born during Solomon's reign, likely experiencing the height of Israel's united kingdom. His age implies a level of maturity, yet his early decisions reflect a lack of wisdom compared to his father Solomon. This contrast highlights the importance of seeking divine wisdom, as emphasized in Proverbs, traditionally attributed to Solomon.<p><b>and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem,</b><br>Rehoboam's reign lasted from approximately 931 to 913 BC. Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, remained the political and spiritual center for the southern kingdom. The city's significance is rooted in its selection by God as the place for His temple, a central theme in the Davidic covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>the city the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel in which to put His Name.</b><br>Jerusalem's selection as the city where God would place His Name underscores its spiritual importance. This choice is linked to God's covenant with David, promising that his lineage would endure and that his son would build the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-16.htm">1 Kings 8:16-20</a>). The temple symbolized God's presence among His people, foreshadowing the coming of Jesus Christ, who is described as the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Naamah the Ammonite.</b><br>Naamah's identity as an Ammonite highlights the political alliances Solomon formed through marriage, which were contrary to God's commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). The inclusion of her nationality serves as a reminder of the dangers of foreign influence leading to idolatry, a recurring issue in Israel's history. This background sets the stage for understanding the spiritual decline during Rehoboam's reign, as he allowed pagan practices to infiltrate Judah (<a href="/1_kings/14-22.htm">1 Kings 14:22-24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah.

In respect of the kingdom of Judah, and of Israel so far as it is connected with Judah, it is largely supplemented by the fuller record of the Chronicles (2 Chronicles 11-17).<p>During this first epoch of the existence of the two kingdoms, including about sixty years, their relations appear to have been incessantly hostile, the aggression being on the side of the kingdom of Israel. In the reign of Rehoboam the invasion of Shishak was probably instigated, perhaps aided, by Jeroboam; subsequently the attack on Abijah, victoriously repelled, seems a direct attempt at subjugation; the same policy in substance is pursued by Baasha, and only checked by the desperate expedient of calling in the foreign power of Syria; till at last, wearied out by continual war against a superior force, Judah, even under such a king as Jehoshaphat, is forced to ally itself, apparently on a footing of something like dependence, with the kingdom of Israel.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, reigned in Judah.
