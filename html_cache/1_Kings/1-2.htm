The servants mentioned here are likely his royal attendants or advisors, who are concerned about the king's well-being. This reflects the common practice in ancient Near Eastern courts where servants played a significant role in the daily life and care of the king. The servants' initiative indicates their loyalty and the importance of maintaining the king's health for the stability of the kingdom.<p><b>&#8220;Let us search for a young virgin</b><br>The search for a young virgin was a customary practice in ancient times, often for reasons of purity and health. Virgins were considered to have a certain vitality and purity that could be beneficial in therapeutic contexts. This practice is not unique to Israel and can be seen in other ancient cultures. The emphasis on her being a virgin also underscores the cultural importance of purity and the role of women in royal service.<p><b>for our lord the king,</b><br>Referring to David as "our lord the king" highlights the respect and reverence his servants have for him, despite his old age and frailty. This title underscores David's continued authority and the loyalty of his subjects. It also reflects the hierarchical structure of the society, where the king was seen as God's anointed and held a central role in the nation's identity and governance.<p><b>to attend to him and care for him</b><br>The role of attending and caring for the king was crucial, especially in his old age. This care would include providing physical warmth, companionship, and possibly medical attention. The mention of care indicates the servants' concern for David's comfort and well-being, which was essential for the stability of the kingdom. This also reflects the broader biblical theme of serving and caring for others, as seen in the New Testament teachings of Jesus.<p><b>and lie by his side to keep him warm.&#8221;</b><br>In the ancient Near East, body heat was a practical method for providing warmth, especially in the absence of modern heating. The act of lying beside the king was not intended for sexual purposes but rather for health and comfort. This practice is indicative of the intimate, yet non-sexual, service roles that women could hold in royal courts. The need to keep David warm also symbolizes his frailty and the transition of power that is about to occur, setting the stage for Solomon's rise to the throne.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The aging king of Israel, who is experiencing physical weakness and needs care.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_of_king_david.htm">Servants of King David</a></b><br>The individuals who suggest finding a young virgin to care for the king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/y/young_virgin.htm">Young Virgin</a></b><br>A proposed solution to attend to King David, providing warmth and care.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where King David resides and where these events take place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/abishag_the_shunammite.htm">Abishag the Shunammite</a></b><br>Although not mentioned in this specific verse, she is the young virgin chosen to care for David, introduced in the following verses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_care_in_old_age.htm">The Importance of Care in Old Age</a></b><br>As King David aged, he required assistance, reminding us of the importance of caring for the elderly in our communities and families.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_practices_and_solutions.htm">Cultural Practices and Solutions</a></b><br>The suggestion to find a young virgin reflects cultural norms of the time.
