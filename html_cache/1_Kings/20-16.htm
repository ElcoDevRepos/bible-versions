The decision to march out at noon suggests a strategic move by the Israelites, possibly to catch the Arameans off guard. This timing could indicate divine guidance, as God often uses unconventional means to achieve His purposes (<a href="/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19-22</a>, the story of Gideon). The midday heat would also be a factor, potentially affecting the readiness and alertness of the opposing forces.<p><b>while Ben-hadad and the 32 kings allied with him</b><br>Ben-hadad was the king of Aram (Syria), a powerful nation to the north of Israel. The mention of "32 kings" indicates a coalition of city-states or smaller kingdoms under his leadership, highlighting the significant threat posed to Israel. This alliance reflects the common practice of forming coalitions for military campaigns in the ancient world. The number 32 may symbolize completeness or a formidable force, emphasizing the odds against Israel. This coalition can be compared to other biblical alliances, such as those seen in <a href="/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14:1-16</a>, where multiple kings joined forces.<p><b>were in their tents getting drunk</b><br>The image of Ben-hadad and his allies getting drunk in their tents suggests a lack of discipline and overconfidence. In the Bible, drunkenness often symbolizes moral and spiritual decay (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>). This behavior contrasts with the sobriety and readiness expected of leaders in times of war. The scene foreshadows their impending defeat, as God often uses the weaknesses of the proud to bring about their downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). This moment can be seen as a divine setup for Israel's victory, reminiscent of other biblical narratives where God intervenes against overwhelming odds (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>, the story of David and Goliath).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) who led a coalition of 32 kings against Israel.
