It signifies God's ongoing relationship and covenant with Israel, emphasizing His role as their deliverer and protector. The Exodus is frequently referenced throughout the Old Testament as a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness (<a href="/exodus/12-51.htm">Exodus 12:51</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>).<p><b>I have not chosen a city from any tribe of Israel</b><br>This highlights that until this point, God had not designated a specific city for His temple. The tabernacle, a portable sanctuary, was used during the wilderness wanderings and the period of the judges. This reflects the transitional nature of Israel's worship practices before the establishment of a permanent temple. The lack of a chosen city underscores the significance of Jerusalem's eventual selection.<p><b>in which to build a house so that My Name would be there</b><br>The "house" refers to the temple, a central place of worship where God's presence would dwell among His people. The concept of God's "Name" being there signifies His presence, authority, and blessing. This is a fulfillment of God's promise to dwell among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>). The temple becomes a focal point for Israel's religious life and a symbol of God's covenant.<p><b>But I have chosen David to be over My people Israel</b><br>David's selection as king marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history. God chose David, a man after His own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>), to lead Israel and establish a dynasty. This choice is significant because it sets the stage for the Davidic Covenant, where God promises that David's descendants will rule Israel, ultimately leading to the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). David's leadership and the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital city are crucial in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who brought Israel out of Egypt and chose David as king.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, delivered from slavery in Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which God delivered the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The chosen king over Israel, a man after God's own heart.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The house for God's Name, which Solomon, David's son, would build in Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_choice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Choice</a></b><br>God is sovereign in His choices, selecting David and Jerusalem for His purposes.<br><br>Reflect on how God&#8217;s choices in our lives may not always align with our expectations but serve His greater plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>David was chosen because of his heart for God.

It should run: "Neither chose I any man to be ruler over my people, but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there, and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel." The parallel in the two points referred to is exact. As there were temporary resting places for the ark--such as Gilgal, Shiloh, Kirjathjearim, and Zion--so there were rulers raised up successively for a time, and then removed. Now there was to be one fixed place as the Sanctuary of God, and one royal house of David to continue for ever.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel, to build a house, that my name might be therein</span> [The chronicler adds here, "Neither chose I any man to be ruler," etc. Probably our account comes nearer to the words actually spoken.
