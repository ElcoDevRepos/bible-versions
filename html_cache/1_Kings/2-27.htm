Abiathar, a descendant of Eli, had supported Adonijah's claim to the throne instead of Solomon, which was a political and spiritual misstep. This act of banishment was not only a political move to consolidate Solomon's power but also a fulfillment of divine judgment. The priesthood was a sacred office, and Abiathar's removal signified a shift in the religious leadership of Israel. This action also highlights the importance of loyalty to God's chosen king, as Solomon was anointed by God through the prophet Nathan.<p><b>and thus fulfilled the word that the LORD had spoken at Shiloh</b><br>The reference to Shiloh connects this event to a prophecy given many years earlier. Shiloh was an important religious center in Israel before the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital. It was at Shiloh that God spoke to the young Samuel, foretelling the downfall of Eli's house due to the wickedness of his sons, Hophni and Phinehas. This prophecy is recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27-36</a>, where God declared that Eli's lineage would be cut off from serving as priests. The fulfillment of this prophecy through Solomon's actions underscores the faithfulness of God's word and His sovereignty over Israel's history.<p><b>against the house of Eli</b><br>The house of Eli had been under divine judgment since the time of Samuel. Eli's failure to restrain his sons led to their corruption and the eventual loss of the Ark of the Covenant to the Philistines. The removal of Abiathar, a descendant of Eli, from the priesthood was the culmination of this judgment. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the importance of holiness in those who serve in spiritual leadership. This event also illustrates the continuity of God's justice across generations, as well as His commitment to purifying His people and their leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, Solomon became king of Israel after David.

The prophecy referred to is, of course, that of <a href="/context/1_samuel/2-30.htm" title="Why the LORD God of Israel said, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD said, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.">1Samuel 2:30-35</a>; <a href="/context/1_samuel/3-11.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that hears it shall tingle.">1Samuel 3:11-14</a>, fulfilled by the degradation, in Abiathar's person, of the house of Ithamar, and the exaltation, or restoration, in Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, to whom, as the elder son of Aaron, the primacy would have seemed naturally to belong. It seems clear from <a href="/1_kings/2-35.htm" title="And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.">1Kings 2:35</a> that Abiathar had hitherto had some superiority, although in the various notices of the two, Zadok's name stands first; but whether of actual authority, or only of priority of dignity, cannot be determined. While the Tabernacle remained at Gibeon under Zadok's charge, and the Ark was in Mount Zion under Abiathar, there might, indeed, be something like co-ordination between the two. This, in any case, must have disappeared at the building of the Temple; and the disgrace of Abiathar determined that the undivided dignity should pass to Zadok.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Solomon thrust out Abtathar from being priest unto the Lord, that he might fulfil</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">to fulfil</span> "An addition of the narrator, not the intention of Solomon.

On the occasion of his first conspiracy, Abiathar seems to have escaped even censure. And yet that conspiracy, had it succeeded, would almost certainly have involved Solomon's death (ch. 1:12). He is now found plotting again, for the action of Solomon proves that there had been a second plot. Oriental usages would have justified his death.
