The division of responsibilities among the governors reflects the administrative structure established by Solomon, which is detailed earlier in <a href="/1_kings/4.htm">1 Kings 4</a>. This system ensured a steady supply of provisions, demonstrating the prosperity and stability of Solomon's kingdom. The monthly rotation suggests a well-planned logistical operation, indicative of the wisdom for which Solomon was renowned (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>). This structure can be compared to the division of labor seen in the New Testament church, where different members have different roles (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>).<p><b>and all who came to his table.</b><br>Solomon's table was not just for personal consumption but was a place of hospitality and diplomacy. It included officials, foreign dignitaries, and others who sought Solomon's wisdom. This reflects the king's role as a central figure in international relations and the spread of Israel's influence. The abundance at Solomon's table is reminiscent of the Messianic banquet prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, symbolizing God's provision and the future kingdom's abundance. It also prefigures the Last Supper, where Jesus shared a meal with His disciples, symbolizing fellowship and covenant.<p><b>They saw to it that nothing was lacking.</b><br>This phrase underscores the efficiency and effectiveness of Solomon's administration. The governors' ability to provide without deficiency points to the kingdom's wealth and the fulfillment of God's promise to bless Israel under Solomon's rule (<a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>). It also reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where resources are managed wisely to meet needs (<a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23-27</a>). In a spiritual sense, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides for all our needs according to His riches in glory (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>), ensuring that nothing is lacking for those who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.

Proper delegation allows leaders to focus on wisdom and justice while others handle logistics (<a href="/acts/6-2.htm">Acts 6:2&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Authority and accountability traveled together.
