The speaker is Obadiah, a devout believer in Yahweh, who is speaking to Elijah. The context is a time of severe drought in Israel, a divine judgment due to the idolatry led by King Ahab and Queen Jezebel. Obadiah is expressing concern and disbelief at Elijah's command, highlighting the tension and fear present in the political and religious climate of the time.<p><b>&#8216;Go tell your master</b><br>The term "master" refers to King Ahab, who was the ruler of the northern kingdom of Israel. Ahab is known for his marriage to Jezebel and the subsequent introduction of Baal worship, which led Israel away from the worship of Yahweh. This phrase underscores the hierarchical structure of the time, where kings held significant power and influence. It also reflects the dangerous position Obadiah is in, serving a king who is hostile to the prophets of Yahweh.<p><b>that Elijah is here!&#8217;</b><br>Elijah, whose name means "My God is Yahweh," is a central prophetic figure in the Old Testament. His presence signifies a direct challenge to the authority of Ahab and the false prophets of Baal. Elijah's role as a prophet is to call Israel back to covenant faithfulness. This moment foreshadows the dramatic confrontation on Mount Carmel, where Elijah will demonstrate the power of Yahweh over Baal. Elijah is often seen as a type of Christ, representing the prophetic voice that calls people to repentance and faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God known for his boldness and faithfulness.

Obadiah has just explained how Ahab &#8220;has searched for you in every nation and kingdom&#8221; (v. 10), requiring oaths that Elijah could not be found.<p>&#8226; Obadiah&#8217;s personal stakes are high. He &#8220;feared the LORD greatly&#8221; (v. 3) and had risked his life hiding the prophets, yet he also served in Ahab&#8217;s court. Standing between two worlds, he voices the concern that obedience to Elijah might cost him everything&#8212;much like Esther faced in <a href="/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11&#8211;16</a>.<p>&#8226; The scene underscores that even faithful believers sometimes wrestle with fear when God&#8217;s commands collide with earthly danger (cf. <a href="/acts/9-13.htm">Acts 9:13&#8211;16</a>, where Ananias hesitates before visiting Saul).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go tell your master</b><p>Elijah&#8217;s directive is plain: deliver the message to Ahab.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Your master&#8221; highlights Obadiah&#8217;s earthly authority. <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a> reminds us God establishes rulers, yet <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a> teaches that obedience to God surpasses all. Obadiah must weigh both truths.<p>&#8226; Similar moments appear in Scripture:<p>&#8211; Nathan stands before David with a hard word from God (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8211; Samuel tells Eli everything despite fear (<a href="/1_samuel/3-15.htm">1 Samuel 3:15&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8211; John the Baptist confronts Herod (<a href="/mark/6-17.htm">Mark 6:17&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; Elijah&#8217;s command is not a suggestion. Prophets speak for the LORD, and their words carry divine authority (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18&#8211;19</a>). Obadiah&#8217;s response will prove where his ultimate allegiance lies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Elijah is here!</b><p>The heart of the message is Elijah&#8217;s presence: God&#8217;s prophet has returned.<p>&#8226; After three and a half years of drought (<a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>), Elijah&#8217;s reappearance signals that God is about to act decisively. Verse 15 clarifies: &#8220;Elijah replied, &#8216;As surely as the LORD of Hosts lives&#8230; I will present myself to Ahab today.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; In Scripture, the arrival of a prophet often precedes a turning point: Moses before Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>), Nathan before David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), and later John the Baptist announcing Jesus (<a href="/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Elijah is here&#8221; ultimately foreshadows the greater Elijah figure, fulfilled in John the Baptist (<a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-14.htm">Matthew 11:14</a>). God&#8217;s pattern is consistent: He sends a herald before unleashing judgment or blessing.<p>&#8226; For Ahab, the words mean accountability. No longer can he hide behind Baal worship or blame the prophet for trouble (see v. 17). The living God confronts him through His servant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/18-11.htm">1 Kings 18:11</a> captures Obadiah&#8217;s conflicted heart as he repeats Elijah&#8217;s daunting instruction. Each clause reveals a layer of tension: surprise, submission, and the announcement of prophetic presence. The verse reminds believers that obedience often feels risky, yet God&#8217;s word carries both authority and assurance. When Elijah appears, droughts end, idols are exposed, and hearts must choose whom they will serve.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">Behold, Elijah</span>.
