It underscores the authority and authenticity of the message. The phrase is reminiscent of other instances where God communicates His will, such as with Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4</a>). It emphasizes the prophetic tradition in Israel, where God reveals His plans and judgments through chosen individuals.<p><b>to Jehu son of Hanani</b><br>Jehu, the son of Hanani, is identified as a prophet. His father, Hanani, was also a prophet who rebuked King Asa of Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-10</a>). This lineage suggests a family dedicated to prophetic ministry. Jehu's role as a prophet is significant in the narrative of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, as he is tasked with delivering God's judgment. The mention of his lineage highlights the continuity of prophetic voices in Israel's history.<p><b>against Baasha,</b><br>Baasha was the king of Israel who reigned after overthrowing the previous king, Nadab, and exterminating the house of Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27-29</a>). His reign is marked by idolatry and sin, continuing the practices of Jeroboam. The phrase "against Baasha" indicates a pronouncement of judgment due to his actions and failure to lead Israel in righteousness. This reflects the Deuteronomic theme of covenant faithfulness and the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>saying:</b><br>The introduction of a direct quote signifies the importance and immediacy of the message. It prepares the reader for the specific content of God's judgment. This format is typical in prophetic literature, where the prophet acts as a mouthpiece for divine revelation. The forthcoming message will reveal God's response to Baasha's actions and set the stage for subsequent events in the narrative of Israel's monarchy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu_son_of_hanani.htm">Jehu son of Hanani</a></b><br>A prophet of the LORD who delivered God's message against Baasha.
