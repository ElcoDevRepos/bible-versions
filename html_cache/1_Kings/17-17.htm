The mention of "the woman who owned the house" highlights her role as the head of the household, which was unusual in the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, indicating her husband's absence, likely due to death. The illness of her son is a pivotal moment, as children were seen as a blessing and a source of security for the future. This event sets the stage for a demonstration of God's power through Elijah, emphasizing the theme of divine intervention in times of crisis.<p><b>and his sickness grew worse and worse</b><br>The progression of the son's illness underscores the severity of the situation and the desperation that would have been felt by the widow. In the ancient Near East, illness was often viewed as a sign of divine displeasure or judgment, and the worsening condition would have been alarming. This phrase also serves to heighten the tension in the narrative, preparing the reader for the miraculous intervention that follows. The escalation of the illness can be seen as a test of faith for both the widow and Elijah, reflecting the broader biblical theme of faith being refined through trials.<p><b>until no breath remained in him</b><br>This phrase indicates the culmination of the son's illness in death, a devastating blow to the widow. In biblical terms, breath is often synonymous with life, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God breathes life into Adam. The absence of breath signifies the complete loss of life, making the situation appear hopeless. This moment foreshadows the resurrection power of God, which is later fully revealed in the New Testament through Jesus Christ. The death of the widow's son parallels other biblical accounts of resurrection, such as the raising of Lazarus in <a href="/john/11.htm">John 11</a>, and serves as a type of Christ's own resurrection, demonstrating God's authority over life and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who is staying with the widow in Zarephath.
