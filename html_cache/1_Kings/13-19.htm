This phrase highlights the prophet's decision to return with the old prophet, despite having received a direct command from God not to eat or drink in that place. This act of disobedience is significant, as it demonstrates the human tendency to be swayed by persuasive words, even when they contradict divine instructions. The old prophet's deception serves as a reminder of the importance of discernment and obedience to God's word. This incident can be compared to the temptation of Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where deception leads to disobedience.<p><b>ate bread in his house</b><br>Eating bread in the old prophet's house symbolizes fellowship and acceptance, which the man of God was explicitly instructed to avoid. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, sharing a meal was a sign of covenant and agreement. By eating bread, the man of God inadvertently aligns himself with the old prophet's actions, which were contrary to God's command. This act of eating can be seen as a breach of the divine command, similar to how the Israelites were warned against making covenants with the inhabitants of the Promised Land (<a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32</a>).<p><b>and drank water</b><br>Drinking water, like eating bread, signifies sustenance and hospitality. The man of God's decision to drink water in the old prophet's house further emphasizes his disobedience to God's specific instructions. Water, often a symbol of life and purity in the Bible, here becomes a symbol of compromise and disobedience. This act can be contrasted with Jesus' refusal to turn stones into bread during His temptation in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3-4</a>), where He remained obedient to God's word despite physical need.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>A prophet from Judah sent by God to deliver a message to King Jeroboam in Bethel.

Mean</div><b>But the man of God went back with him</b><p>God had clearly told the man of Judah, &#8220;You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/13-9.htm">1 Kings 13:9</a>). Yet, after standing firm before King Jeroboam, he lets his guard down when an older prophet claims an angelic exemption (<a href="/1_kings/13-18.htm">1 Kings 13:18</a>).<p>&#8226;Obedience is not a one-time achievement; it must be sustained. Saul learned this the hard way when Samuel said, &#8220;To obey is better than sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226;No new message&#8212;even one supposedly from an angel&#8212;can overrule what God has already spoken (<a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226;The scene warns against assuming that past victories guarantee future faithfulness; &#8220;Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ate bread in his house</b><p>Eating in Scripture often signifies fellowship and agreement. By sharing a meal in Bethel, the prophet silently endorsed a place and a priesthood God had rejected (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>).<p>&#8226;Compromise frequently comes dressed as hospitality. Lot&#8217;s wife looked back for something seemingly harmless, yet it cost her everything (<a href="/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26</a>).<p>&#8226;Even when motives appear kind, any act that contradicts God&#8217;s word places us in dangerous partnership (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226;Jesus resisted a similar temptation when Satan urged Him to turn stones into bread, replying, &#8220;Man shall not live on bread alone&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And drank water</b><p>The simplest, most basic need becomes disobedience when God forbids it.<p>&#8226;Small steps of rebellion matter; Eve merely &#8220;took and ate,&#8221; but that bite altered history (<a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226;We must &#8220;trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>), even in everyday decisions like food and drink.<p>&#8226;The man of God&#8217;s thirst reveals that physical cravings can dull spiritual vigilance; therefore we are told, &#8220;Do not be drunk with wine&#8230; but be filled with the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Verse 19 captures the tragic moment when a faithful servant becomes a cautionary tale.
