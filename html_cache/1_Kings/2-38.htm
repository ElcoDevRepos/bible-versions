This reflects the biblical principle of submission to authority, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>, where believers are instructed to be subject to governing authorities. Shimei's acceptance of the sentence also highlights the importance of recognizing the righteousness of God's appointed leaders, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Shimei replied.</b><br>Shimei's response is significant because it shows his willingness to verbally submit to Solomon's authority. Historically, Shimei was a member of the tribe of Benjamin and had previously cursed King David (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-13</a>). His reply here indicates a shift from his earlier rebellious behavior, possibly out of fear or genuine repentance. This moment can be seen as a turning point in Shimei's relationship with the Davidic line.<p><b>"Your servant will do as my lord the king has spoken."</b><br>This phrase underscores the hierarchical relationship between Shimei and Solomon. The use of "your servant" indicates humility and submission, which is a recurring theme in the Bible, where individuals recognize their position before God and His anointed leaders. This mirrors the attitude of believers who are called to serve Christ, the ultimate King, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>, where Jesus is described as taking the form of a servant.<p><b>And Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.</b><br>Shimei's residence in Jerusalem is significant both geographically and theologically. Jerusalem, the city of David, represents the center of Israel's religious and political life. By living there, Shimei is under the direct oversight of Solomon, ensuring his compliance with the king's command. This situation reflects the broader biblical theme of living under God's watchful eye, as seen in <a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>, which speaks of God's constant vigilance over His people. Additionally, Shimei's extended stay in Jerusalem can be seen as a period of grace, allowing him time to demonstrate his loyalty and repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shimei.htm">Shimei</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Benjamin who had previously cursed King David.

Solomon sits on David&#8217;s throne by divine appointment (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>), so to call the sentence fair is to affirm God&#8217;s order.<p>&#8226; The moment recalls Shimei&#8217;s earlier mercy: David spared him after he cursed the king (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-13</a>; 19:18-23). Now, justice and mercy meet: Solomon gives a conditional reprieve, and Shimei agrees it is deserved.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Your servant will do as my lord the king has spoken.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Shimei pledges obedience.

By choosing servanthood rather than rebellion, Shimei models the posture believers owe the Lord (<a href="/luke/17-10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet words alone are insufficient (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). The coming verses test whether his confession aligns with enduring faithfulness (<a href="/1_kings/2-39.htm">1 Kings 2:39-40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.</b><p>&#8226; For years Shimei remains within the boundaries Solomon set, illustrating:<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s patience that allows time for repentance or faithfulness (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>&#8211; The blessing found in staying inside God-ordained limits (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>).<p>&#8226; However, longevity is not immunity. When Shimei later leaves Jerusalem to chase runaway slaves (<a href="/1_kings/2-39.htm">1 Kings 2:39</a>), he breaks the covenant he affirmed, and judgment falls (<a href="/1_kings/2-46.htm">1 Kings 2:46</a>).<p>&#8226; His extended compliance followed by failure warns that:<p>&#8211; Partial or temporary obedience is ultimately disobedience (<a href="/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7-9</a>).<p>&#8211; Delayed consequences do not negate certainty of divine justice (<a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>; <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Shimei judged Solomon&#8217;s conditions to be fair, pledged loyal obedience, and lived within those rules for many years.
