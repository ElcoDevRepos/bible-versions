Originally, it contained the golden pot of manna and Aaron's rod that budded, but by this time, only the two stone tablets remained. These tablets, inscribed with the Ten Commandments, represented God's law and covenant with Israel. The absence of other items may signify a focus on the enduring nature of God's law.<p><b>that Moses had placed in it at Horeb</b><br>Horeb, another name for Mount Sinai, is where Moses received the Ten Commandments from God.

All other artifacts have disappeared, but God&#8217;s covenant word endures. The tablets, placed by Moses at Horeb after the Exodus, testify that the same God who saved Israel now dwells among them in the temple. For every generation, the takeaway is clear: God&#8217;s redeemed people anchor their worship and obedience in His unchanging, covenant-revealed Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">There was nothing.</span>--The emphasis of this (repeated in <a href="/2_chronicles/5-10.htm" title="There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.">2Chronicles 5:10</a>) is remarkable, and seems intended to make it clear that the various things laid up "before the testimony"--the pot of manna (<a href="/context/exodus/16-33.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.">Exodus 16:33-34</a>), the rod of Aaron (<a href="/numbers/17-10.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and you shall quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.">Numbers 17:10</a>), the copy of the Law (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/31-24.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,">Deuteronomy 31:24-26</a>)--were not in the ark, but (as in the last case is actually stated), at "the side of the ark." Unless any change afterwards took place--which is highly improbable--this clear statement must determine the interpretation of the well-known passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="/1_kings/9-4.htm" title="And if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my judgments:">1Kings 9:4</a>), in which no stress need be laid on the literal accuracy of the word "wherein;" for its purpose is simply a general description of the Temple, its chief parts, and its most sacred furniture. The command to deposit the tables in the ark is recorded in <a href="/exodus/25-16.htm" title="And you shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you.">Exodus 25:16</a>, and the actual deposit of them there in <a href="/exodus/40-20.htm" title="And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark:">Exodus 40:20</a>, immediately after the erection of the Tabernacle. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there</span> [<a href="/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-5.htm">Deuteronomy 10:5</a>. This statement appears to be at variance with <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>, which mentions "the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded," as in the ark, along with "the tables of the covenant." And it is to be observed that, while our text excludes these relics from the ark (<span class="accented">temp</span>. Solomon), no other scripture save that just cited expressly includes them. In <a href="/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a> and Numbers 17:25 (Heb. A.V., Numbers 17:10) they are commanded to be laid up "before the testimony," words which no doubt may mean, as they were long interpreted to mean, "before the tables of testimony in the ark" - observe, the words are "before the <span class="accented">testimony</span>," not "before the <span class="accented">ark"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> but which are now generally thought to import "in front of the ark which con-rained the testimony." We know the book of the law was put "at the side (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) of the ark" (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>), and hence it is held by some that the golden pot, etc., occupied a similar position. It seems preferable, however, considering the distinct statement of St. Paul, or the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which, to say the least, embodies Jewish tradition, to adhere to the ancient interpretation that the golden pot of manna and Aaron's rod were in the ark. And this in no wise conflicts with the statement of the text, for these treasures might well have been removed by the Philistines, whose first thought, we may be sure, would be to open their new acquisition. It is not improbable, indeed, that the object of the men of Bethshemesh in looking into the ark was to see whether these treasures were still there. For if the golden pot ever was in the ark, we can hardly suppose it would escape the rapacity of the Philistines, who would leave the two tables of stone as things of no value. Indeed, it is just possible that the trespass offering, the golden mice, etc., were designed as a return for the golden pot which had been removed. And the statement of the text, "there was nothing," etc., almost implies that there had been something there at one time (see Alford on <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>). It seem probable, therefore, that the golden pot and Aaron's rod were originally deposited "before the testimony" in the ark; that they were removed during its captivity (<a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>.); and that the sacrilege was discovered at Bethshemesh (<a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>). This last mentioned episode explains how it came to be known that "there was nothing," etc. It is hardly likely after that memorable visitation that Solomon could have opened the ark and taken out the two relics, as Rawlinson suggests. Nor have we any warrant for the view that the mercy seat, with the cherubs, was removed to make way for a new lid without them, and so the interior of the ark was disclosed to view (Stanley) ] <span class="cmt_word">at Horeb</span> [See <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-6.htm">Exodus 33:6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>.
