This fear is not merely about being afraid but involves a deep respect and commitment to obeying God's commandments. In the context of Solomon's prayer during the temple dedication, it reflects the desire for the Israelites to maintain a covenant relationship with God, acknowledging His sovereignty. This fear is foundational to wisdom, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, and is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing the importance of living in accordance with God's will.<p><b>all the days they live</b><br>This phrase underscores the perpetual nature of the Israelites' commitment to God. It implies a lifelong dedication, not just a temporary or situational obedience. The call to fear God "all the days" suggests a continuous, unwavering faithfulness that should characterize the life of every believer. This idea is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5-6</a>, where the Israelites are commanded to love the Lord with all their heart, soul, and strength, indicating a holistic and enduring devotion.<p><b>in the land</b><br>The land holds significant theological and historical importance for the Israelites. It is the Promised Land, a tangible sign of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The land is not just a physical territory but a place where God's people are to live out their covenantal relationship with Him. The land is a gift from God, and living in it comes with the responsibility to uphold His statutes and commands. This connection between the land and the covenant is a central theme in the Pentateuch and is reiterated throughout the historical books.<p><b>that You gave to our fathers</b><br>This phrase highlights the continuity of God's promises and faithfulness across generations. The reference to "our fathers" connects the current generation of Israelites to the patriarchs, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's covenantal promises. It serves as a reminder of God's unchanging nature and His commitment to His people. The land was promised to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a> and reaffirmed to Isaac and Jacob, symbolizing God's enduring faithfulness. This inheritance is not just a matter of ancestral right but a divine gift, underscoring the grace and sovereignty of God in the history of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem and is offering a prayer of dedication to God in this chapter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, God's chosen people, who are the primary audience of Solomon's prayer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, which God gave to the ancestors of the Israelites, a land flowing with milk and honey.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God whom Solomon is addressing in his prayer, seeking His favor and guidance for the people of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fear_of_the_lord_as_a_foundation.htm">The Fear of the Lord as a Foundation</a></b><br>The fear of the Lord is foundational for a life that honors God.

True worship results in a sustained, obedient awe that secures every generation&#8217;s place in God&#8217;s covenant blessings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.</span> [Solomon anticipates that a godly fear will be the result of forgiveness and restoration. We find the same thought in <a href="/psalms/130-4.htm">Psalm 130:4</a>. The mercy and goodness of God <span class="accented">should</span> lead to repentance, but unhappily it not unseldom fails to do so.] The fifth petition contemplates the prayers which foreigners, attracted by the fame of Jerusalem, of its religion and sanctuary could offer towards the house. The Gentiles who should visit Jerusalem would assuredly, with their polytheistic ideas and their belief in local or tribal deities, invoke the aid and blessing of the mighty God of Jacob. This mention of aliens from the commonwealth of Israel in the prayer of dedication, especially when viewed in the light of the exclusiveness and bigotry which characterized the Jews of later days, is especially to be noticed. As Rawlinson (<span class="accented">in loco</span>) observes, "Nothing is more remarkable in the Mosaic law than its liberality with regard to strangers." He then quotes <a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-19.htm">Deuteronomy 10:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-12.htm">Deuteronomy 31:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-14.htm">Numbers 15:14-16</a>; and adds: "It is quite in the spirit of these enactments that Solomon, having first prayed God on behalf of his fellow countrymen, should next go on to intercede for the strangers," etc. The intercourse of the Hebrews at this period with foreign nations, and the influence they exercised on the Jewish thought and manners (see Stanley, "Jewish Ch." 2. Leer. 26.), are also to be remembered. These new relations with the stranger would no doubt have widened Solomon's views. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/8-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">so that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1433;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4616.htm">Strong's 4616: </a> </span><span class="str2">Purpose -- intent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they may fear You</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1469;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural &#124;
