The City of David refers to the original stronghold of Jerusalem, which David captured and made his capital. This move signifies a transition from the older part of the city to a new, more prestigious residence, reflecting Solomon's wealth and status. The marriage to Pharaoh's daughter is significant as it represents a union with a powerful foreign nation, which was both a political strategy and a potential spiritual compromise, as foreign wives often brought their gods and practices with them (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>).<p><b>to the palace that Solomon had built for her</b><br>Solomon's construction of a separate palace for Pharaoh's daughter indicates the importance of this marriage alliance. It also reflects the grandeur of Solomon's building projects, which included the Temple and his own palace. The separate residence may have been intended to honor her status or to keep her distinct from the religious life centered around the Temple. This act of building a palace for her can be seen as a fulfillment of Solomon's commitment to his foreign alliances, but it also foreshadows the potential for idolatry and division within Israel, as Solomon's heart would later be led astray by his foreign wives (<a href="/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3-4</a>).<p><b>he built the supporting terraces</b><br>The supporting terraces, also known as the Millo, were part of Solomon's extensive building projects in Jerusalem. These terraces were likely used to fortify the city and provide a stable foundation for the expanding urban area. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Millo was a significant structure in ancient Jerusalem, contributing to the city's defense and infrastructure. This construction reflects Solomon's wisdom and administrative skills in organizing large-scale projects, but it also required heavy taxation and labor from the Israelites, which later contributed to discontent and division in the kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>).

The completion of the palaces rendered it no longer necessary or proper that Solomon's daughter should dwell in a separate house. The chronicler tells us that she had dwelt in David's palace on Mount Zion, and that Solomon was constrained to remove her, because he looked upon all the precinct as now consecrated (<a href="/2_chronicles/8-11.htm">2 Chronicles 8:11</a>) ]. <span class="cmt_word">Pharaoh's daughter came up</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>.
