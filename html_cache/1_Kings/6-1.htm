This period is significant as it represents a time of fulfillment of God's promises to Israel, transitioning from a nomadic existence to a settled nation with a central place of worship. The Exodus is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing deliverance and covenant relationship with God. This timeline also reflects the long-awaited establishment of a permanent dwelling place for God among His people, as previously, the Ark of the Covenant had been housed in a tent or tabernacle.<p><b>in the fourth year of Solomon&#8217;s reign over Israel</b><br>Solomon's reign is marked by peace and prosperity, allowing for the focus on building projects, most notably the temple. The fourth year of his reign suggests a period of stability and consolidation of power, enabling Solomon to undertake such a significant project. Solomon's wisdom and wealth, gifts from God, are instrumental in the successful completion of the temple. This period also reflects the transition from the leadership of David, who had the desire to build the temple, to Solomon, who was chosen by God to fulfill this task.<p><b>in the month of Ziv, the second month</b><br>The month of Ziv corresponds to April-May in the modern calendar. This timing is significant as it follows the Passover, a festival commemorating the Exodus, thus linking the temple's construction to Israel's deliverance and God's faithfulness. The agricultural calendar also suggests a time of renewal and growth, symbolizing new beginnings for Israel with the establishment of the temple as a central place of worship.<p><b>he began to build the house of the LORD</b><br>The phrase "house of the LORD" emphasizes the temple's purpose as a dwelling place for God among His people. This construction marks the fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would build a house for God's name. The temple serves as a type of Christ, foreshadowing Jesus as the ultimate temple, where God's presence dwells fully. The building of the temple signifies a new era in Israel's worship, moving from a portable tabernacle to a permanent structure, symbolizing God's enduring presence and covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and king of Israel, known for his wisdom and for building the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and established as a nation under God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which the Israelites were delivered, symbolizing bondage and oppression.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziv.htm">Ziv</a></b><br>The second month of the ancient Hebrew calendar, corresponding to April-May, when the construction of the temple began.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites and a symbol of God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_over_time.htm">God's Faithfulness Over Time</a></b><br>The 480 years since the Exodus highlight God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises across generations.

In the LXX., 440 is read for 480, possibly by an interchange of two similar Hebrew letters, or, perhaps, by reckoning from the completion of Exodus at the death of Moses instead of its beginning. The Vulgate agrees with the Hebrew text. Josephus, on the other hand, without any hint of any other reckoning in the Scriptural record, gives 592 years. The date itself, involving some apparent chronological difficulties, has been supposed to be an interpolation; but without any sufficient ground, except Josephus's seeming ignorance of its existence, and some early quotations of the passage by Origen and others without it; and in neglect of the important fact that, disagreeing <span class= "ital">prima facie </span>with earlier chronological indications in Scripture, it is infinitely unlikely to have been thus interpolated by any mere scribe.<p>These indications are, however, vague. The period includes the conquest and rule of Joshua, the era of the Judges down to Samuel, the reigns of Saul and David, and the three years of Solomon's reign already elapsed. Now, of these divisions, only the last three can be ascertained with any definiteness, at about 83 years. The time occupied by the conquest and rule of Joshua, cannot be gathered with any certainty from Scripture. The same is the case with the duration of some of the subsequent Judgeships. Even the numerous chronological notices given in the Book of Judges are inconclusive. We cannot tell whether they are literally accurate, or, as the recurrence of round numbers may seem to suggest, indefinite expressions for long periods; nor can we determine how far the various Judgeships were contemporaneous or successive. The tradition followed by St. Paul (<a href="/context/acts/13-19.htm" title="And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.">Acts 13:19-21</a>), assigning to the whole a period of 450 years, agrees generally with the latter idea. The genealogies given (as, for example, of David, in <a href="/context/ruth/4-18.htm" title="Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,">Ruth 4:18-22</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/2-3.htm" title="The sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah: which three were born to him of the daughter of Shua the Canaanitess. And Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the sight of the LORD; and he slew him.">1Chronicles 2:3-15</a>, and elsewhere) agree with the former. Hence, these vague chronological statistics cannot constitute <span class= "bld">a </span>sufficient ground for setting aside a date so formally and unhesitatingly given at an important epoch of the history, corresponding to the equally formal determination of the date of the Exodus in <a href="/context/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40-41</a>. The omission of the date in quotations, again, proves little. The different date given by Josephus, without any notice of that which we now have, presents the only real difficulty. But it is possible that he may have been inclined tacitly to harmonise his chronology with some other reckoning known in his time among the heathen; and in any case it is doubtful whether his authority can outweigh that of our present text and the ancient versions. On the whole, therefore, the grounds assigned for rejection of the chronological notice of this verse, are insufficient.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt</span> [This date has been the subject of much controversy, which cannot even now be considered (<span class="accented">pace</span> Keil: "The correctness of the number 480 is now pretty generally admitted") as closed.
