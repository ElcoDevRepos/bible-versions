His life is characterized by a deep commitment to God, demonstrated through his psalms and his leadership as king. David's righteousness is seen in his adherence to God's laws and his efforts to establish a kingdom that honored God. His actions, such as bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem (2 Samuel 6), reflect his desire to center the nation around worship of the LORD.<p><b>and had not turned aside from anything the LORD commanded</b><br>David's obedience is highlighted throughout his reign, as he sought to follow God's commandments. This phrase underscores his faithfulness in maintaining the covenant relationship with God, which was central to Israel's identity. His commitment to God's commands is evident in his military campaigns, his justice in governance, and his personal devotion, as seen in his psalms and prayers.<p><b>all the days of his life</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the consistency of David's faithfulness. Despite the challenges and trials he faced, including opposition from Saul and internal family strife, David remained devoted to God. His life serves as a model of perseverance in faith, illustrating the importance of lifelong commitment to God's ways.<p><b>except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite</b><br>This exception refers to David's sin involving Bathsheba and Uriah (2 Samuel 11). David's adultery with Bathsheba and the subsequent orchestration of Uriah's death represent a significant moral failure. This incident is a reminder of human fallibility, even among those who are deeply committed to God. It also highlights the themes of repentance and forgiveness, as David's genuine repentance (Psalm 51) leads to his restoration, though not without consequences. This narrative foreshadows the need for a perfect king, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is without sin and provides ultimate redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and his role in establishing Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel.

Before major decisions he inquired of the LORD (<a href="/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>; 5:19, 23).<p>&#8226; When confronted by opportunities for personal gain, David deferred to God&#8217;s commands&#8212;spare Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4-6</a>), honor covenant vows with Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1-7</a>), accept God&#8217;s discipline (<a href="/2_samuel/24-10.htm">2 Samuel 24:10-14</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/119-34.htm">Psalm 119:34</a> echoes David&#8217;s heart: &#8220;Give me understanding that I may obey Your law and follow it with all my heart&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;all the days of his life&#8221; underlines consistency. Righteousness is portrayed not as an occasional act but as a sustained lifestyle (<a href="/psalms/78-72.htm">Psalm 78:72</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite</b><p>&#8226; Scripture is honest about David&#8217;s greatest moral failure&#8212;his adultery with Bathsheba and the engineered death of her husband, Uriah (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s assessment in <a href="/2_samuel/12-9.htm">2 Samuel 12:9</a> is unflinching: &#8220;You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword... and you took his wife as your own&#8221;.<p>&#8226; This exception shows that even a believer &#8220;after God&#8217;s own heart&#8221; can fall deeply when he ceases to watch and pray (<a href="/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1-4</a> traces David&#8217;s repentance).<p>&#8226; Yet the single-word hinge &#8220;except&#8221; also highlights grace: one dark episode does not nullify a lifetime of walking with God once genuine repentance occurs (<a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Takeaway: sin has consequences, but genuine confession restores fellowship (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/15-5.htm">1 Kings 15:5</a> presents David as God&#8217;s benchmark for faithful leadership. His overall life was marked by wholehearted obedience and continual dependence on the LORD, though marred by a grievous lapse involving Uriah. The verse calls readers to the same sustained devotion, warns against moments of spiritual drift, and reassures that sincere repentance can restore the believer to the path of righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Save only in the matter of Uriah.</span>--In this passage alone do we find this qualification of the praise of David.
