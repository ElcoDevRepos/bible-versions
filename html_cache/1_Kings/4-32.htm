The proverbs attributed to Solomon are a collection of wise sayings that provide practical guidance for living a life pleasing to God. These proverbs are primarily found in the Book of Proverbs, which is traditionally ascribed to Solomon. The number "three thousand" signifies not only the vastness of his wisdom but also the breadth of topics covered, from personal conduct to governance. Solomon's wisdom was so profound that people from all nations came to hear it (<a href="/1_kings/4-34.htm">1 Kings 4:34</a>), and his proverbs continue to be a source of moral and spiritual instruction.<p><b>and his songs numbered a thousand and five</b><br>Solomon's musical contributions, though less emphasized than his proverbs, reflect his creative and artistic abilities. The "thousand and five" songs suggest a prolific output, indicating that Solomon was not only a wise ruler but also a patron of the arts. The Song of Songs, also known as the Song of Solomon, is the most famous of his songs and is included in the biblical canon. It is an allegorical poem that celebrates love and is often interpreted as a representation of the love between Christ and the Church. Solomon's songs, like his proverbs, demonstrate the integration of wisdom and worship, showing that true wisdom encompasses all aspects of life, including the emotional and spiritual. Solomon's role as a type of Christ is seen in his wisdom, his role as a builder of the temple, and his reign of peace, prefiguring the ultimate wisdom and peace brought by Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.

The Book of Proverbs belongs mainly, but not exclusively, to the second class. Its main part consists of two series of "Proverbs of Solomon" (Proverbs 10-24, 25-29), composed or collected by him; falling, however, far short of the number given in this verse. The earlier portion (see especially <a href="/context/1_kings/1-20.htm" title="And you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.">1Kings 1:20-33</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-2.htm" title="Why his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.">1Kings 1:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-8.htm" title="But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.">1Kings 1:8</a>) partakes more of the character of the first and fourth classes; and in <a href="/context/ecclesiastes/12-3.htm" title="In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,">Ecclesiastes 12:3-6</a>, and perhaps <a href="/context/proverbs/30-15.htm" title="The horse leach has two daughters, crying, Give, give.
