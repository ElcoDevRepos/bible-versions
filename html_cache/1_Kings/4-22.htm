The daily provisions indicate the scale of the royal household and the administrative structure required to support it. Solomon's court was a center of political and economic activity, reflecting the fulfillment of God's promise to make Israel a great nation (<a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>). The abundance also symbolizes the peace and stability during Solomon's reign, as prophesied in <a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>.<p><b>were thirty cors of fine flour</b><br>A "cor" is a Hebrew unit of measurement, roughly equivalent to about 220 liters or 6 bushels. Thirty cors of fine flour suggest a significant amount of bread production, indicative of the large number of people in the royal court and the extensive hospitality expected of a king. This provision reflects the agricultural prosperity of Israel under Solomon, as well as the fulfillment of <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>, where God promises a land of plenty.<p><b>sixty cors of meal</b><br>The meal, or coarse flour, was likely used for more common purposes than the fine flour, such as feeding servants and animals. The doubling of the amount compared to fine flour suggests a well-organized and hierarchical distribution of resources. This abundance can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides spiritual sustenance abundantly to all who come to Him (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). The provision of meal also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's provision for His people, as seen in the manna provided in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.

This computation, however, could have but little value did not his calculations, based on the consumption of flesh, mentioned presently (allowing 1.5 lbs. per head), lead to the same result. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/4-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Solomon&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1465;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;m&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8010.htm">Strong's 8010: </a> </span><span class="str2">Solomon -- David's son and successor to his throne</span><br /><br /><span class="word">provisions</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1462;&#1469;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(le&#183;&#7717;em-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for a single</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1425;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
