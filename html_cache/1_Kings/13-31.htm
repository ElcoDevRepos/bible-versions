The burial signifies respect and acknowledgment of the man of God's prophetic role, despite his disobedience. In ancient Israel, burial practices were significant, often reflecting one's honor and status. The act of burial by the prophet indicates a recognition of the man of God's divine mission and the tragic consequences of his disobedience.<p><b>the prophet said to his sons</b><br>The old prophet's communication with his sons highlights the familial transmission of values and beliefs. In the ancient Near Eastern context, family lines were crucial for maintaining religious and cultural traditions. The prophet's instructions to his sons suggest a desire to align himself with the man of God, perhaps recognizing the truth of his message and the seriousness of his own role in the events that transpired.<p><b>&#8220;When I die, you must bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried.</b><br>This request underscores the old prophet's desire to be associated with the man of God even in death. Tombs in ancient Israel were often family affairs, and requesting to be buried in the same tomb signifies a spiritual kinship or solidarity. This act can be seen as an acknowledgment of the man of God's divine mission and a desire to share in his legacy. It also reflects the belief in the afterlife and the hope of being remembered alongside a true servant of God.<p><b>Lay my bones beside his bones,</b><br>The phrase "lay my bones beside his bones" indicates a desire for posthumous association and perhaps reconciliation. In biblical times, bones were often seen as the essence of a person, and their placement held significant meaning. This request may symbolize the old prophet's repentance and recognition of the man of God's righteousness. It also foreshadows the future prophecy concerning Josiah, who would later desecrate the altar at Bethel, sparing the bones of the man of God and the prophet, thus fulfilling the prophecy and preserving their memory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_old_prophet.htm">The Old Prophet</a></b><br>An older prophet living in Bethel who deceives the man of God from Judah, leading to the latter's death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god_from_judah.htm">The Man of God from Judah</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God to Bethel to prophesy against the altar, who is later deceived by the old prophet.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant city in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, known for its idolatrous practices, particularly under King Jeroboam.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_the_old_prophet.htm">The Sons of the Old Prophet</a></b><br>Witnesses to the events and bearers of the old prophet's instructions regarding his burial.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_grave.htm">The Grave</a></b><br>The burial site where both the man of God and the old prophet are eventually laid to rest, symbolizing a shared legacy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The man of God's downfall was due to disobedience to God's direct command.

It also verifies the prophet&#8217;s remorse and recognition that the dead man&#8217;s message was truly from God (v. 26), affirming that divine words are unbreakable (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the prophet said to his sons</b><p>&#8211;

The request foreshadows God&#8217;s later protection of both sets of bones when King Josiah burns the idolatrous graves but spares this tomb (<a href="/2_kings/23-17.htm">2 Kings 23:17-18</a>).<p>&#8211;

By requesting burial beside the man of God, he confesses the younger prophet&#8217;s legitimacy, teaches his sons to revere divine truth, and anticipates future vindication when God distinguishes those who obey Him. The verse reminds us that genuine repentance seeks visible alignment with God&#8217;s purposes and that the LORD faithfully remembers His servants, even down to their bones.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the sepulchre</span> [Palestine, being of limestone formation, has a large number of caves. These, enlarged and adapted, were everywhere used for interments. ("The whole cliffs on its southern side [Hinnom] are honeycombed with tombs," Porter). In three sides of the cave vaults (<span class="accented">loculi</span>), each large enough to hold a body, were recessed in the rock, the entrance being closed by a slab of stone (see Conder, pp. 85, 96, 118, etc.) In the so called "tombs of the kings" and "prophets" we have such sepulchres on a large scale. A Paper on the Tombs of Palestine will be found in the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund, p. 66 sqq.

But it is not absolutely certain that this arrangement (of <span class="accented">loculi</span>) obtained at this early period. The bodies may have been in much closer contact. See <a href="/2_kings/13-21.htm">2 Kings 13:21</a>. The LXX. adds here, "That my bones may be saved with his bones;" an obvious gloss, founded on <a href="/2_kings/23-18.htm">2 Kings 23:18</a>. This request throws some light on the yearning desire of the modern Jew to rest as near as possible to the bodies of the saints.
