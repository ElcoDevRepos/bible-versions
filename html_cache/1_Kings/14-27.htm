The context of this verse follows the invasion of Jerusalem by Shishak, king of Egypt, who took away the treasures of the temple and the royal palace, including the gold shields Solomon had made. The replacement of gold with bronze signifies a decline in wealth and glory, reflecting the spiritual and moral decline of the nation. Bronze, while valuable, is inferior to gold, symbolizing a loss of divine favor and blessing. This act of replacing gold with bronze can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual compromise and decline of the kingdom under Rehoboam's rule.<p><b>and committed them to the care of the captains of the guard</b><br>The captains of the guard were responsible for the security of the king and the palace. By entrusting the bronze shields to them, Rehoboam ensured that the appearance of royal splendor and protection was maintained, even if the reality was diminished. This act reflects a focus on outward appearances rather than true spiritual and moral integrity. The captains of the guard were likely part of the elite military forces, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a semblance of strength and stability in the face of external threats and internal decline.<p><b>on duty at the entrance to the royal palace</b><br>The entrance to the royal palace was a place of significant importance, symbolizing the power and authority of the king. It was a location where official business was conducted and where the king's presence was most felt. By stationing the bronze shields at the entrance, Rehoboam aimed to project an image of continuity and strength despite the loss of the original gold shields. This act can be seen as an attempt to preserve the dignity and honor of the monarchy, even as the kingdom faced challenges. The entrance to the palace was also a place where the people could see the king's wealth and power, making the display of the shields a public statement of resilience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_rehoboam.htm">King Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, Rehoboam's reign was marked by division and decline.
