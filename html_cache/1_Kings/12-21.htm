Jerusalem, the capital of the united kingdom under David and Solomon, remained the political and spiritual center for the southern kingdom of Judah. This city held the Temple, which Solomon had built, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<p><b>he mobilized the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin</b><br>The "whole house of Judah" refers to the tribe of Judah, which was the largest and most influential tribe in the southern kingdom. The inclusion of Benjamin, a smaller tribe, highlights the political alliance and shared heritage between these tribes. Historically, Benjamin had close ties with Judah, as seen in the support for David's kingship. This mobilization indicates a significant military effort, reflecting the seriousness of the division within the kingdom.<p><b>180,000 chosen warriors</b><br>The number 180,000 suggests a substantial military force, emphasizing the scale of the conflict and the resources at Rehoboam's disposal. These "chosen warriors" were likely experienced soldiers, selected for their skill and loyalty. This reflects the common ancient Near Eastern practice of assembling elite troops for critical battles.<p><b>to fight against the house of Israel</b><br>The "house of Israel" refers to the northern tribes that had rejected Rehoboam's rule and followed Jeroboam. This division marked the beginning of the divided monarchy, with Israel in the north and Judah in the south. The conflict between these two kingdoms would persist throughout their histories, often leading to warfare and political instability.<p><b>and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon</b><br>Rehoboam's intent to "restore the kingdom" underscores his desire to reunite the divided nation under his rule, maintaining the legacy of his father, Solomon, and grandfather, David. This reflects the Davidic covenant, where God promised David an everlasting dynasty. However, the division was part of God's judgment due to Solomon's idolatry, as prophesied by Ahijah the Shilonite (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-39</a>). Rehoboam's efforts, therefore, were contrary to the divine decree, highlighting the tension between human ambition and divine will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Judah.

The prophet Ahijah had already declared the split as divine judgment (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; God will soon intervene through Shemaiah to stop the attack, saying, &#8220;This thing is from Me&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/12-24.htm">1 Kings 12:24</a>), proving that no army size can overturn His decree.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon</b><p>&#8226; Rehoboam&#8217;s objective was reunification, but it ignored God&#8217;s word that the kingdom would be torn from Solomon&#8217;s line except for &#8220;one tribe&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; His motive reveals a struggle all leaders face: cling to personal power or submit to God&#8217;s higher plan (<a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Restoration, in God&#8217;s timing, will ultimately come through another Son of David&#8212;Jesus&#8212;who unites all who trust Him (<a href="/ezekiel/37-22.htm">Ezekiel 37:22&#8211;24</a>; <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse therefore highlights human plans versus divine sovereignty; history will move forward as the LORD has decided, not as kings prefer (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/12-21.htm">1 Kings 12:21</a> portrays Rehoboam&#8217;s immediate response to losing ten tribes: he rushes to Jerusalem, rallies Judah and Benjamin, musters 180,000 elite soldiers, and prepares for civil war to reclaim the united throne. Each clause shows escalating resolve&#8212;yet the very next verses reveal God halting the campaign because the division came from Him. The passage teaches that even formidable resources and earnest intentions cannot override God&#8217;s sovereign purposes; lasting unity will only arrive through the covenant King God Himself provides.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah with</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the tribe of Benjamin,</span> [It is at first sight somewhat surprising that Benjamin, so long the rival of Judah, and which had so long resisted the rule of David, should on this occasion have detached itself from the leadership of Ephraim, its near and powerful neighbour, and a tribe, too, with which it had a sort of hereditary connexion. That a sort of jealousy existed at one time between the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, consequent, no doubt, on the transference of the sceptre from the house of Saul to that of David, <span class="cmt_word">is</span> very evident. A thousand men of Benjamin constituted the following of the rebel Shimei, (<a href="/2_samuel/19-17.htm">2 Samuel 19:17</a>). The rising of Sheba the Benjamite, again (<a href="/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>), proves that the enmity and discontent were not even then subdued. But when the ten tribes fell away, Benjamin seems never to have faltered in its allegiance. The change is easily accounted for. It was the glory of Benjamin that Jerusalem, the joy of the whole earth, the civil and religious capital of the nation, was largely within its border. "The city of the Jebusite" was in the lot of Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>). But it was also on the boundary line of Judah. This fact had, no doubt, brought the two tribes into close contact, and had given them interests in common, in fact had "riveted them together as by a cramp" (Blunt, pp. 167, 174, who traces "a gradual tendency of the ten tribes to become confederate under Ephraim," and a growing alliance and community of interests between Judah and Benjamin); and now Benjamin could not fail to see that separation from Judah would mean the loss of Jerusalem (which would be largely peopled by the men of Judah, David's tribe, and would be practically in their hands), while adhesion to Ephraim would not prevent the establishment of another sanctuary further north. The traditions of fifty years, consequently, and the common interest in the capital, prevailed over hereditary ties and ancient feuds, and decided Benjamin to cast in its lot with Judah;the more so, as the heads of this tribe may have felt, after once furnishing Israel with its king, as jealous of Ephraim as they had once been of Judah. It must not be forgotten, however, that some portions of Benjamin, including Bethel, Gilgal, and Jericho, were incorporated in the northern kingdom (Ewald) ], <span class="cmt_word">an hundred and fourscore thousand</span> <span class="cmt_word">chosen men</span> [the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f76;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> = 120,000, but the larger number need create no astonishment. At the time of David's census, the men of Judah numbered - if the figures can be depended on - 500,000, while Abijah could muster some 18 years afterwards an army of 400,000 (2 Chronicles 1 [lit., <span class="accented">making war</span>]<span class="accented">,<span class="cmt_word"></span> to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon.</span> [It is characteristic of Rehoboam that he proposes forthwith to subdue the rebellious tribes by force.
