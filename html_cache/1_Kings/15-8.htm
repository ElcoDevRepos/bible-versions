The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a continuation of lineage and tradition. It implies that Abijam was buried in the family tomb, a practice that was significant in maintaining family heritage and honor. This phrase also reflects the biblical theme of mortality and the transient nature of human life, as seen in other passages like <a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a> regarding Abraham.<p><b>and was buried in the City of David</b><br>The City of David refers to Jerusalem, specifically the ancient part of the city that David captured from the Jebusites and established as his capital (<a href="/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>). Being buried in the City of David was a mark of honor and legitimacy, signifying Abijam's rightful place in the Davidic line. This location is significant in biblical history as it underscores the importance of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel. Archaeological findings in the area, such as the stepped stone structure, provide insights into the city's ancient fortifications and royal tombs.<p><b>and his son Asa reigned in his place</b><br>Asa's ascension to the throne marks a transition in the leadership of Judah. Asa is noted for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry, as detailed in later verses (<a href="/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11-15</a>). His reign is characterized by a return to the worship of Yahweh, contrasting with the practices of his predecessors. Asa's rule is significant in the biblical narrative as it highlights the recurring theme of covenant faithfulness and the consequences of idolatry. His reign also sets the stage for future kings and the ongoing struggle between faithfulness to God and the temptation of foreign influences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijam.htm">Abijam</a></b><br>Also known as Abijah, he was the king of Judah and the son of Rehoboam.
