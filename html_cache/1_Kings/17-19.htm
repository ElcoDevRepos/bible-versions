In the context of ancient Israel, prophets were seen as intermediaries between God and the people. Elijah's command reflects his confidence in God's power to intervene in dire situations. This moment also highlights the deep trust the widow had in Elijah, as she was willing to hand over her deceased son, a significant act of faith and desperation. This phrase echoes the biblical theme of surrendering one's burdens to God, as seen in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>, where Jesus invites those who are weary to come to Him.<p><b>So he took him from her arms,</b><br>The act of taking the child from the mother's arms is symbolic of transferring the burden of grief and hopelessness to God. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the embrace of a mother was a place of safety and nurture, and relinquishing her son signifies a profound act of trust. This action can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament theme of casting one's cares upon God, as found in <a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>.<p><b>carried him to the upper room where he was staying,</b><br>The upper room in ancient Israelite homes was often a place of seclusion and prayer, away from the daily activities of the household. It was a space where one could seek God in solitude. Elijah's choice to bring the child to this location underscores the importance of seeking divine intervention in a private, dedicated space. This setting foreshadows the upper room in the New Testament, where significant events, such as the Last Supper and the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, took place (<a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>, <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>).<p><b>and laid him on his own bed.</b><br>By placing the child on his own bed, Elijah demonstrates personal care and responsibility for the situation. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who took upon Himself the burdens and sins of humanity. The bed, a place of rest, symbolizes the peace and restoration that God can bring even in the face of death. This moment prefigures the resurrection power of Jesus, who would later raise the dead, as seen in the accounts of Jairus's daughter (<a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41-42</a>) and Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43-44</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God, known for his faithfulness and miraculous works.

Elijah answers, not with despair, but with calm assurance that God can act.<p>&#8226; His words reveal pastoral compassion mixed with prophetic confidence, much like Jesus&#8217; response to the widow at Nain: &#8220;Do not weep&#8221; (<a href="/luke/7-13.htm">Luke 7:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Elijah does not debate or analyze the tragedy; he moves immediately toward intercession, echoing other prophetic moments of decisive faith (<a href="/2_kings/4-2.htm">2 Kings 4:2</a>; <a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Give me your son"</b><p>&#8226; Elijah invites the mother to place what is dearest&#8212;and now lifeless&#8212;into God&#8217;s care. This is reminiscent of Hannah presenting Samuel to the LORD (<a href="/1_samuel/1-27.htm">1 Samuel 1:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; The directive calls for surrender. Just as Jesus said, &#8220;Bring him here to Me&#8221; when faced with the epileptic boy (<a href="/matthew/17-17.htm">Matthew 17:17</a>), Elijah becomes the mediator who carries the burden to the LORD.<p>&#8226; By commanding rather than requesting, Elijah signals his certainty that God intends to work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he took him from her arms</b><p>&#8226; The prophet does not keep a pious distance; he embraces the child, mirroring the compassion of the Shepherd who &#8220;gathers the lambs in His arms&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Touch is a recurring conduit of divine power&#8212;Jesus &#8220;took the children in His arms and blessed them&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-16.htm">Mark 10:16</a>) and touched Jairus&#8217;s daughter (<a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>).<p>&#8226; Elijah&#8217;s personal involvement underscores that God&#8217;s servants are to embody His tenderness, not merely preach it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Carried him to the upper room where he was staying</b><p>&#8226; The upper room is a place set apart, free from distraction, much like the chamber Elisha later uses for the Shunammite boy (<a href="/2_kings/4-10.htm">2 Kings 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, upper rooms become settings for pivotal acts of God: the raising of Dorcas (<a href="/acts/9-37.htm">Acts 9:37-40</a>) and the Last Supper (<a href="/mark/14-15.htm">Mark 14:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By withdrawing to this private space, Elijah demonstrates that miracles flow from intimate communion with God, not public spectacle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And laid him on his own bed</b><p>&#8226; Elijah places the lifeless boy where he himself rests, identifying with the child&#8217;s condition. This anticipates Christ, who &#8220;bore our griefs&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>) and shared our mortality.<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s own bed becomes an altar of expectation. Similar posture appears when Elisha stretches himself over the Shunammite child (<a href="/2_kings/4-34.htm">2 Kings 4:34</a>) and when Jesus takes Jairus&#8217;s daughter by the hand before commanding life to return (<a href="/matthew/9-25.htm">Matthew 9:25</a>).<p>&#8226; By substituting his resting place for the boy&#8217;s, Elijah pictures the gospel pattern: the living giving place to the dead so the dead might live.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/17-19.htm">1 Kings 17:19</a> shows Elijah&#8217;s swift, compassionate, faith-filled response to tragedy. He receives the child from a grieving mother, carries him to a secluded upper room, and lays him on his own bed&#8212;all tangible actions that display trust in a God who raises the dead. Each movement points forward to the greater Prophet, Jesus, who will personally bear our sorrows and conquer death. The verse teaches that real faith acts, intercedes, and identifies with the suffering, confident that the Lord of life still answers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto her, Give me thy son.
