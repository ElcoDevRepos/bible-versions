The twelve oxen represent the twelve tribes of Israel, signifying the unity and strength of the nation. Oxen were considered symbols of strength and service, reflecting the role of Israel as a servant nation to God. The use of oxen also connects to the sacrificial system, as oxen were common sacrificial animals.<p><b>three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east</b><br>The orientation of the oxen in four cardinal directions symbolizes the universality of God's covenant with Israel, extending to all corners of the earth. This arrangement may also reflect the encampment of the tribes around the Tabernacle during the wilderness period, as described in <a href="/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>. It emphasizes the centrality of worship and God's presence among His people, with the Temple as the focal point.<p><b>The Sea rested on them</b><br>The resting of the Sea on the oxen signifies stability and support, much like God's sustaining power for Israel. This imagery can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the foundation and support for the Church. The Sea's position on the oxen also highlights the importance of the priestly function of cleansing, which is foundational to the worship and service in the Temple.<p><b>with all their hindquarters toward the center</b><br>The inward-facing hindquarters of the oxen suggest a focus on the centrality of God's presence in the Temple. This orientation can be seen as a reminder that all aspects of life and worship should be directed towards God. It also reflects the idea of humility and submission, as the oxen, despite their strength, are positioned in service to the Temple's function. This can be paralleled with the Christian call to live a life centered on Christ, with all actions and intentions directed towards Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>This refers to the large basin or laver used in Solomon's Temple for the priests to wash.
