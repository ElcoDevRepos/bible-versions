His hearing "about this" refers to the news of Solomon's death and the subsequent gathering of Israel to make Rehoboam king. Jeroboam's role in the kingdom was significant, as he was prophesied by Ahijah the Shilonite to become king over ten tribes of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). This prophecy set the stage for the division of the united monarchy. Jeroboam's hearing of the events in Israel marks a pivotal moment in biblical history, as it leads to the fulfillment of God's judgment on Solomon's idolatry.<p><b>he was still in Egypt</b><br>Jeroboam's presence in Egypt is significant. He fled there to escape Solomon's wrath after a prophecy indicated he would rule over part of Israel. Egypt, during this period, was a place of refuge for political exiles. The Pharaoh Shishak (Sheshonq I) provided asylum to Jeroboam, which indicates the political alliances and tensions of the time. This connection to Egypt also foreshadows future interactions between Israel and Egypt, including Shishak's later invasion of Judah (<a href="/1_kings/14-25.htm">1 Kings 14:25-26</a>).<p><b>where he had fled from King Solomon</b><br>Jeroboam fled from Solomon due to a threat on his life after Solomon learned of the prophecy concerning Jeroboam's future rule. This flight underscores the tension and unrest during the latter part of Solomon's reign, as his idolatry led to divine judgment and the eventual division of the kingdom. Solomon's actions against Jeroboam reflect the king's attempts to maintain control and suppress any threats to his dynasty, despite God's declared will.<p><b>and had been living ever since</b><br>Jeroboam's extended stay in Egypt suggests a period of preparation and waiting. His time in Egypt can be seen as a parallel to Moses' time in Midian, where he also fled from a king and later returned to lead his people. This period of exile allowed Jeroboam to gather support and plan for his eventual return to Israel. It also highlights the theme of God's sovereignty and timing in raising leaders according to His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam_son_of_nebat.htm">Jeroboam son of Nebat</a></b><br>A former servant of King Solomon who became the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

But according to our received text, Jeroboam was one of the deputation which met king Rehoboam at Shechem. It has been found necessary, consequently, to understand the words of the death of Solomon, which has been related in <a href="/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>.

It is true it involves but a slight change, and it may simplify the construction. But no change is really required, Bahr's objection, that in the text, as it stands, we have an unmeaning repetition, "He was still in Egypt... and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt," loses all its force if we understand Jeroboam to have continued his residence in Egypt (as the LXX. says he did) after hearing of Solomon's death. until summoned by the tribes to be their leader.
