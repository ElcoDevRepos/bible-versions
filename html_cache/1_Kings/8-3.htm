Elders were leaders and representatives of the tribes, and their presence underscores the unity and collective participation of the nation in this sacred event. This assembly reflects the organizational structure of ancient Israel, where elders played a crucial role in governance and decision-making (<a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>, <a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a>). The event is a fulfillment of God's promise to establish a place for His name (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>), and the elders' presence highlights the communal acknowledgment of this divine plan.<p><b>the priests took up the ark</b><br>The priests, descendants of Aaron, were the only ones permitted to handle the Ark of the Covenant, as outlined in the Law (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). The Ark, a symbol of God's presence and covenant with Israel, contained the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>). Its movement to the temple marks a significant transition from the tabernacle, a mobile sanctuary, to a permanent dwelling place for God's presence in Jerusalem. This act fulfills the promise of a centralized place of worship (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>). The Ark's journey to the temple can be seen as a type of Christ, who embodies the presence of God among His people (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The reverence and care with which the priests handle the Ark reflect the holiness and sanctity associated with God's presence, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>, <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_israel.htm">Elders of Israel</a></b><br>These were the leaders and representatives of the tribes of Israel, respected for their wisdom and authority.

Every tribal elder stands before God&#8217;s dwelling place (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/8-4.htm">1 Samuel 8:4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Their presence fulfills God&#8217;s desire that leaders guide the people into covenant faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9-13</a>).<p>&#8226; By waiting until &#8220;all&#8221; have come, Solomon models orderly worship and reverence&#8212;no one is left outside God&#8217;s plans (compare <a href="/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/13-1.htm">1 Chronicles 13:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment also anticipates the later assemblies in which Israel renews covenant commitments (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-29.htm">2 Chronicles 34:29-32</a>), reminding us that worship involves corporate accountability before the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the priests took up the ark</b><p>With the elders in place, &#8220;the priests took up the ark.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God had prescribed that only the consecrated priests or Levites carry the ark (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>). Solomon&#8217;s adherence to this order contrasts with earlier missteps, such as Uzzah&#8217;s tragic death when the ark was moved improperly (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The ark, symbolizing God&#8217;s throne and covenant, now transitions from the temporary tent to the permanent temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-4.htm">2 Chronicles 5:4-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The priests lifting the ark instead of rolling or dragging it reinforces the holiness of God&#8217;s presence and the seriousness of obedience (<a href="/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the scene foreshadows Christ our High Priest who alone bears us into God&#8217;s holy presence (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>), reminding believers that approaching God requires the mediator He appoints.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a> shows a nation&#8217;s leaders gathered in unity and reverence, with consecrated priests faithfully handling the ark exactly as God commanded.

Hence in this passage, with literal accuracy, it is said, first, that "the priests took up the ark;" then (<a href="/1_kings/8-4.htm" title="And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.">1Kings 8:4</a>) that the priests and Levites brought up the ark and the holy things; and, lastly (<a href="/1_kings/8-6.htm" title="And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.">1Kings 8:6</a>), that "the priests brought in the ark into the oracle." Josephus, indeed, declares that, as was natural on this occasion of special solemnity--just as at the passage of the Jordan, and the circuit round the walls of Jericho (<a href="/context/joshua/3-6.htm" title="And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.">Joshua 3:6-17</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-6.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.">Joshua 6:6</a>)--the priests themselves bore the ark, while the Levites bore only the vessels and furniture of the Tabernacle. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the elders of Israel came</span> [Not a mere repetition. The men who were summoned to Jerusalem (ver. 1) were all present, of their own accord, to witness the removal], <span class="cmt_word">and the priests took up the</span> ark. tin the parallel account in <a href="/2_chronicles/5-4.htm">2 Chronicles 5:4</a>, we read that "<span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">Levites</span> took up the ark." But there is no contradiction, as has been too readily supposed. For ver. 7 of the Chronicles," <span class="accented">the priests</span> brought in the ark," etc., confirms the statement of the text. And the explanation is suggested in ver. 5 of the same chapter, "These did the priests, the Levites (so the Heb.) bring up." Same expression in <a href="/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3</a>. All the priests were Levites - Keil translates, "the Levitical priests" - and this somewhat singular expression is no doubt used to remind us that such was the case. Nor need it cause us any surprise to find the priests employed in this service. It is true that the ark was given into the charge of the Kohathite Levites (<a href="/numbers/3-30.htm">Numbers 3:30, 31</a>); and it was their duty to bear it (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-9.htm">Numbers 7:9</a>; <a href="/numbers/10-21.htm">Numbers 10:21</a>; cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2, 11, 12</a>). But the real care and supervision of the ark always belonged to the sons of Aaron. It was their office, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, to put on or take off the covering of the ark and of the vessels, which the Levites were forbidden directly to touch (<a href="/numbers/4-5.htm">Numbers 4:5-15</a>). It was quite in accordance with the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of these provisions that Solomon now entrusted the carriage of the ark to the superior order. But more than that, Solomon was not without precedent to justify his choice, indeed, we may see in his selection of the priests a minute mark of truth, amounting almost to an undo-signed coincidence. For we find that on occasions of extraordinary solemnity - at the crossing of the Jordan, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, (<a href="/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6, 15, 17</a>), and at the siege of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-6.htm">Joshua 6:6</a>), the <span class="accented">priests</span> had borne the ark (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11, 12</a>). It was no doubt these familiar precedents guided Solomon, or the ecclesiastical authorities, in their selection of the priests on this occasion. A "settled place," a "house of cedars" (<a href="/2_samuel/7-7.htm">2 Samuel 7:7</a>), "having now been found for the ark" to abide in, after it had "dwelt in curtains" for 500 years, it was taking its last journey, and in order to mark this journey as exceptional, in order to show both the ark and the house the greater reverence, it was determined that it should be borne for the last time by the priests. Keil suggests that the ark may have been uncovered, but this is very improbable. Why, we may ask, were coverings provided, and their use prescribed (<a href="/numbers/4-5.htm">Numbers 4:5-15</a>), if they were to be arbitrarily dispensed with? He also adds that Levites were not allowed to enter the most holy place. But neither, it may be added, was this lawful for the priests. Levites and priests might enter that day, because the house was not then dedicated. The cloud (ver. 10) claimed it for God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/8-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the elders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ziq&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2205.htm">Strong's 2205: </a> </span><span class="str2">Old</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had arrived,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1429;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
