Chariots and horses were symbols of power and prestige in the ancient Near East. The accumulation of such a large number of chariots and horses indicates Solomon's strategic military planning and his desire to establish a strong defense system. This also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to make Solomon a great and prosperous king. However, it is important to note that <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a> warns against multiplying horses, as it could lead to reliance on military might rather than on God. This accumulation may suggest a deviation from the ideal kingship as outlined in the Torah.<p><b>which he stationed in the chariot cities</b><br>The mention of "chariot cities" indicates that Solomon had specific locations designated for housing and maintaining his chariots and horses. These cities were likely fortified and strategically located to protect the kingdom and ensure rapid deployment of military forces. Archaeological evidence suggests that cities like Megiddo, Hazor, and Gezer were among these chariot cities, as they have yielded remains of stables and other military installations. This strategic placement underscores Solomon's administrative and military acumen.<p><b>and also with him in Jerusalem</b><br>By keeping some of the chariots and horses in Jerusalem, Solomon ensured that the capital city was well-defended and that he had immediate access to military resources. Jerusalem, being the political and spiritual center of Israel, required strong protection. This also symbolizes the centralization of power in the monarchy, with Solomon maintaining direct control over his military assets. The presence of these resources in Jerusalem could be seen as a reflection of the city's importance and Solomon's role as a powerful and wise ruler.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chariots_and_horses.htm">Chariots and Horses</a></b><br>Symbols of military strength and power in ancient times.

It may perhaps be said that this force was necessary to keep the tributary kings in due subjection. But it seems quite as likely that it was maintained largely for the sake of pomp and display. Solomon seems to have determined in every way, and at any cost, to rival and surpass all contemporary kings.
