The use of water in this scene is significant, especially during a time of severe drought in Israel, as described earlier in <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a>. The act of pouring water on the offering and wood emphasizes the miraculous nature of the impending divine intervention, as it would be impossible for a water-soaked sacrifice to ignite naturally. This act also symbolizes purification and dedication, as water is often used for cleansing in biblical rituals. The number four, represented by the four waterpots, can symbolize completeness or universality in biblical numerology, suggesting the totality of God's power over creation.<p><b>&#8220;Do it a second time,&#8221; he said, and they did it a second time.</b><br>The repetition of the act of pouring water serves to further emphasize the miraculous power of God. By instructing the people to do it a second time, Elijah is ensuring that there is no doubt about the authenticity of the miracle that is about to occur. This mirrors the biblical principle of establishing truth through repetition or multiple witnesses, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>. The act of repeating the water pouring also serves to heighten the anticipation and tension of the narrative, drawing attention to the power of God that will soon be displayed.<p><b>&#8220;Do it a third time,&#8221; he said, and they did it a third time.</b><br>The third repetition of pouring water is significant in biblical symbolism, as the number three often represents divine completeness or perfection. This can be seen in various scriptural contexts, such as the Trinity or Jesus' resurrection on the third day. By having the water poured three times, Elijah is underscoring the completeness of the preparation for God's demonstration of power. This act also prefigures the resurrection of Christ, where the seemingly impossible (life from death) is made possible by divine intervention. The thorough soaking of the offering and wood ensures that the subsequent fire from heaven is undeniably an act of God, leaving no room for doubt or natural explanation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who played a crucial role in demonstrating God's power over the false god Baal.
