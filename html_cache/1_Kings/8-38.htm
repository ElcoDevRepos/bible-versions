In the context of <a href="/1_kings/8.htm">1 Kings 8</a>, Solomon is dedicating the temple, a central place of worship for the Israelites. The temple serves as a physical representation of God's presence among His people. The idea of prayer and petition is deeply rooted in the Jewish tradition, where individuals and the community bring their requests before God. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to hear and respond to the prayers of His people (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The temple becomes a focal point for these interactions, symbolizing God's accessibility and willingness to engage with His people.<p><b>each knowing his own afflictions</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the personal nature of prayer, where each individual is aware of their own struggles and needs. It underscores the importance of self-awareness and humility in approaching God. The Hebrew understanding of afflictions often includes both physical and spiritual hardships. This personal knowledge of one's afflictions is crucial for sincere prayer, as seen in the Psalms, where David frequently expresses his personal struggles and seeks God's intervention (<a href="/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3-4</a>). The recognition of one's own afflictions is a step towards repentance and seeking God's mercy.<p><b>and spreading out his hands toward this temple&#8212;</b><br>The act of spreading out hands is a traditional posture of prayer in the ancient Near East, symbolizing openness, surrender, and a plea for divine intervention. This gesture is seen in various parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/exodus/9-29.htm">Exodus 9:29</a>, where Moses spreads out his hands to the Lord. The direction towards the temple signifies the centrality of the temple as the dwelling place of God's name and presence. It reflects the belief that prayers offered towards the temple are particularly potent, as the temple is the designated place for God's presence on earth (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-20.htm">2 Chronicles 6:20</a>). This act also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of Jesus Christ as the ultimate temple, where believers direct their prayers through Him, as He is the mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>, <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem and is offering a prayer of dedication in this chapter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The covenant community of God, who are being invited to bring their prayers and petitions to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who hears the prayers of His people and dwells in the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart.htm">The Heart</a></b><br>Represents the inner life and true intentions of a person, which God alone fully knows.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_the_heart_in_prayer.htm">The Importance of the Heart in Prayer</a></b><br>God knows the true afflictions and desires of our hearts.

The posture is secondary; the heart of faith is primary (<a href="/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>).
