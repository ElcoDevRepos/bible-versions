His reign is marked by idolatry and political instability. His wife, though unnamed, plays a crucial role in this narrative. The use of his wife indicates a personal and secretive mission, reflecting the gravity of the situation.<p><b>Now get up, disguise yourself so they will not recognize you as my wife</b><br>The act of disguise suggests fear and desperation. Jeroboam's concern for anonymity highlights the tension between his public persona and private actions. Disguise in biblical narratives often signifies deception or a lack of faith, as seen in <a href="/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a> with Jacob and Esau. This also reflects Jeroboam's awareness of his unpopularity and the potential consequences of his actions.<p><b>and go to Shiloh</b><br>Shiloh was an important religious center before the establishment of Jerusalem as the spiritual heart of Israel.

His presence in Shiloh indicates his continued role as a divine messenger. Prophets in Israel were seen as intermediaries between God and the people, and Ahijah's involvement underscores the seriousness of Jeroboam's inquiry.<p><b>it was he who spoke about my kingship over this people</b><br>This phrase recalls Ahijah's prophecy in <a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11</a>, where he symbolically tore a new garment into twelve pieces, giving ten to Jeroboam. This act signified God's judgment on Solomon's house and the division of the kingdom.

It is evident that the old blind prophet still remained there, and exercised his prophetic office for the benefit of Israel, though he stood aloof from, and denounced, the new idolatry of Bethel. This idolatry is always described as pre-eminently the "sin of Jeroboam," who by it "made Israel to sin." Hence, while in consequence of it the royal house is condemned, the people are still regarded as God's chosen people, to whom, even more than to the inhabitants of the kingdom of Judah, the prophets ministered, and to whom--having no longer the Temple and the consecrated royalty of David, as perpetual witnesses for God--the prophetic ministrations were of pre-eminent importance. Accordingly, the wife of Jeroboam is bidden to approach the prophet disguised as a daughter of the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jeroboam said to his wife</span> [Conscious that his proceedings would merit Ahijah's reproof, he is afraid to go in person. And his wife - if in this particular we may trust the LXX., an Egyptian princess - could be more readily disguised. The commission was too delicate to be entrusted to a stranger. "None might know it but his own bosom, and she that lay in it" (Bp. Hall).

"There is no site in the country fixed with greater certainty than that of Shiloh" (Conder, p. 44. See <a href="/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>). The identification, however, was only effected in 1838. Conder gives some interesting particulars which lead him to believe that we can identify the very site of the tabernacle. For its history, see <a href="/joshua/16-5.htm">Joshua 16:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1-10</a>; <a href="/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a>; <a href="/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/41-5.htm">Jeremiah 41:5</a>.

Shiloh was probably the birthplace, as well as the residence, of Ahijah. It was in the territory of Ephraim (<a href="/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a>), and at no great distance from Bethel. We can only explain Ahijah's continued residence there, after the migration of the God-fearing Israelites to the southern kingdom, not by his great age, but by the supposition that, having been concerned in the transfer of the kingdom to Jeroboam, he felt it a duty to stay and watch his career. And the time has now come when he can be useful. His relations with Jeroboam had apparently so far been good.
