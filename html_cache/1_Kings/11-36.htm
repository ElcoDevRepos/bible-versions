The "one tribe" is often understood to be Judah, which remained loyal to the house of David. This decision highlights God's faithfulness to His covenant with David, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, where God promises David that his kingdom will endure forever. The preservation of one tribe ensures the continuation of David's line, ultimately leading to the birth of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Son of David" (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><b>so that My servant David will always have a lamp before Me</b><br>The metaphor of a "lamp" signifies the enduring presence and legacy of David's dynasty. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a lamp symbolized life, guidance, and continuity. This promise of a "lamp" is reiterated in <a href="/2_kings/8-19.htm">2 Kings 8:19</a>, where it is stated that the Lord was unwilling to destroy Judah for the sake of David, His servant, as He had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants. This imagery also foreshadows the coming of Christ, the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), who fulfills the Davidic covenant.<p><b>in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem holds significant theological and historical importance as the city chosen by God for His temple and the center of worship for Israel. It is the city where David established his capital and where Solomon built the temple. Jerusalem is often seen as a symbol of God's presence among His people and is central to biblical prophecy, including its role in the end times (<a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>). The city's selection underscores God's sovereign choice and His plan for redemption through the lineage of David.<p><b>the city where I chose to put My Name</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's divine selection of Jerusalem as the spiritual center for His people. In <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>, God instructs the Israelites to seek the place He will choose to put His Name, which is ultimately revealed as Jerusalem. The concept of God's Name being placed in a location signifies His presence, authority, and blessing. This choice is not only about geographical preference but also about establishing a place where God's covenant with Israel is manifested and where His glory dwells, as seen in the dedication of Solomon's temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and king of Israel, whose heart turned away from God due to his foreign wives and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>Solomon's son, who would inherit the kingdom but only retain one tribe due to Solomon's disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The servant of God, whose lineage God promised to preserve as a "lamp" in Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city chosen by God to put His Name, central to His covenant with David.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_division_of_the_kingdom.htm">The Division of the Kingdom</a></b><br>The event where the united kingdom of Israel was divided into the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah).<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Promises</a></b><br>Despite human failure, God remains faithful to His covenant, as seen in His promise to David.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Solomon's turning away from God led to the division of the kingdom, highlighting the importance of obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_jerusalem.htm">The Significance of Jerusalem</a></b><br>As the city where God chose to put His Name, Jerusalem holds a central place in God's redemptive plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_symbol_of_the_lamp.htm">The Symbol of the Lamp</a></b><br>Represents the enduring presence and guidance of God through the Davidic line, ultimately fulfilled in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_and_influence.htm">Legacy and Influence</a></b><br>Our actions and faithfulness can impact future generations, as seen in the legacy of David and Solomon.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_11_36_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 11:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_11_36_God_s_promise_to_David.htm">How does 1 Kings 11:36 highlight God's promise to David's lineage?
