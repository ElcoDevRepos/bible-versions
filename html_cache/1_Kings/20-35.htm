The prophets in Israel often acted under direct instruction from God, serving as His mouthpieces. The phrase "by the word of the LORD" underscores the seriousness and divine origin of the message or action. This is a common expression in the Old Testament, emphasizing that the prophets' actions and words were not of their own invention but were commanded by God (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/15-10.htm">1 Samuel 15:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a>).<p><b>one of the sons of the prophets</b><br>The "sons of the prophets" refers to a group or guild of prophets who were often under the leadership of a more prominent prophet, such as Elijah or Elisha. These groups were common in Israel and served as training grounds for future prophets. They were communities dedicated to studying and proclaiming God's word, similar to a seminary or religious school. This context highlights the communal and educational aspect of prophetic ministry in ancient Israel.<p><b>said to his companion</b><br>The term "companion" suggests a fellow member of the prophetic community. This interaction indicates a close relationship and mutual respect among the prophets. The request made by the prophet is unusual, suggesting a test of obedience or a symbolic act, which was not uncommon in prophetic ministry (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-3</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4:1-3</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Strike me, please!&#8221;</b><br>The request to be struck is a prophetic action, often used to convey a message or symbolize a future event. Prophets frequently used dramatic actions to illustrate their messages (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/13.htm">Jeremiah 13:1-11</a>, <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2-9</a>). The request for a blow may symbolize impending judgment or the seriousness of the message to be delivered. It also tests the obedience of the companion to the prophetic word.<p><b>But the man refused to strike him.</b><br>The refusal to comply with the prophet's request indicates a lack of understanding or unwillingness to participate in the prophetic act. This disobedience contrasts with the expected response to a divine command, highlighting the importance of obedience to God's word. The refusal can be seen as a failure to recognize the authority of the prophetic message, which often had serious consequences (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/13-21.htm">1 Kings 13:21-24</a>). This incident underscores the theme of obedience and the cost of disregarding God's instructions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_the_prophets.htm">Sons of the Prophets</a></b><br>A group of prophets or prophetic disciples in Israel, often seen as a community dedicated to serving God and receiving His revelations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophet.htm">The Prophet</a></b><br>An unnamed prophet who receives a word from the LORD and acts upon it, demonstrating obedience to God's command.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_companion.htm">The Companion</a></b><br>The man who is asked to strike the prophet but refuses, leading to consequences for his disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_the_lord.htm">The Word of the LORD</a></b><br>The divine command given to the prophet, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's instructions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom where these events take place, during a time of conflict and divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_word.htm">Obedience to God's Word</a></b><br>The passage underscores the necessity of obeying God's commands, even when they seem unusual or difficult.

Prophetic sign-acts shock audiences into attention.<p>&#8226; Here, the wound will allow the prophet to masquerade as a battle casualty, confronting Ahab with a parable (<a href="/1_kings/20-37.htm">1 Kings 20:37-42</a>).<p>&#8226; His polite &#8220;please&#8221; shows courtesy even while conveying God&#8217;s urgent directive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the man refused to strike him.</b><p>&#8226; The refusal may appear compassionate, but it is direct disobedience to a God-given order, paralleling Jonah&#8217;s flight (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Immediate consequence follows: &#8220;Because you have not obeyed&#8230; a lion will strike you&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/20-36.htm">1 Kings 20:36</a>). This echoes the judgment on the man of God who ate bread in Bethel (<a href="/1_kings/13-24.htm">1 Kings 13:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The incident teaches that selective obedience is disobedience; God values obedience over good intentions (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35</a> shows a lesser-known prophet executing a dramatic assignment &#8220;by the word of the LORD.&#8221; Each phrase underscores God&#8217;s active voice, the necessity of unquestioning obedience, and the sobering reality that even well-meaning reluctance invites discipline. The episode prepares the king&#8212;and us&#8212;to heed God promptly, trusting that His commands, however strange, serve a righteous and redemptive purpose.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">A certain man</span>--according to Josephus, Micaiah, the son of Imlah. This tradition, or conjecture, agrees well with the subsequent narrative in 1 Kings 22.<p><span class= "bld">The sons of the prophets.</span>--This phrase, constantly recurring in the history of Elijah and Elisha, first appears here. But the thing designated is apparently as old as the days of Samuel who is evidently surrounded by "a company" of disciples. (See <a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm" title="After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:">1Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm" title="And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came on him, and he prophesied among them.">1Samuel 10:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/19-20.htm" title="And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.">1Samuel 19:20</a>.) The prophetic office seems never to have been, like the priesthood or kingship, hereditary. "Sonship," therefore, no doubt means simply discipleship; and it is likely enough that the schools of the sons of the prophets were places of higher religious education, including many who did not look for the prophetic vocation; although the well-known words of Amos (<a href="/amos/7-14.htm" title="Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdsman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:">Amos 7:14</a>), "I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son," clearly indicate that from their ranks, generally though not invariably, the prophets were called. Probably the institution had fallen into disuse, and had been revived to seal and to secure the prophetic victory over Baal-worship. To Elijah the "sons of the prophets" look up with awe and some terror; to Elisha, with affectionate respect and trust.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a certain man</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">one man</span>; cf. <a href="/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11</a>, note] <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the sons</span> of <span class="cmt_word">the prophets</span> [Here mentioned for the first time, though the prophetic schools probably owed their existence, certainly their development, to Samuel.

The word, again, does not necessarily imply youth.

For it is obvious that he might have sustained his part, told his story, and obtained a judgment from the king, without proceeding to such painful extremities. It is quite true that a person thus wounded would perhaps sustain the part of one who had been in battle <span class="accented">better</span>, but the wounds were in no way necessary to his disguise, and men do not court pain without imperious reasons. Besides, it was "in the word of the Lord" that these wounds were sought and received. It is quite clear, therefore, that it cannot have been merely to give him a claim to an audience with the king (Ewald) - he could easily have simulated wounds by means of bandages, which would at the same time have helped to disguise him - or that he might foreshadow in his own person the wounding which Ahab would receive (<a href="/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a>), for of that he says nothing, or for any similar reason. The wounding, we may be quite sure, and the tragical circumstances connected therewith, are essential parts of the parable this prophet had to act, of the lesson he had to teach. 1%w the great lesson he had to convey, not to the king alone, but to the prophetic order and to the whole country, the lesson most necessary in that lawless age, was that of implicit unquestioning obedience to the Divine law. Ahab had just transgressed that law. He had "let go a man whom God had appointed to utter destruction;" he had heaped honours on the oppressor of his country, and in gratifying benevolent impulses had ignored the will and counsel of God (see on ver. 42). No doubt it seemed to him, as it has seemed to others since, that he had acted with rare magnanimity, and that his generosity in that age, an age which showed no mercy to the fallen, was unexampled. But he must be taught that he has no right to be generous at the expense of others; that God's will must be done even when it goes against the grain, when it contradicts impulses of kindness, and demands painful sacrifices. He is taught this by the prophetic word (ver. 42), but much more effectively by the actions which preceded it. A prophet required to smite a brother prophet, and that for no apparent reason, would no doubt find it repugnant to his feelings to do so; it would seem to him hard and cruel and shameful to smite a companion. But the prophet who refused to do this, who followed his benevolent impulses in preference to the word of the Lord, died for his sin - died forthwith by the visitation of God. What a lesson was this to king and country - for no doubt the incident would be bruited abroad, and the very strangeness of the whole proceeding would heighten the impression it made. Indeed, it is hardly possible to conceive a way in which the duty of unquestioning obedience could be more emphatically taught. When this prophet appeared before the king, a man had smitten and wounded him, disagreeable and painful as the task must have been, because of the word of the Lord; whilst a brother prophet, who declined the office because it was painful, had been slain by a wild beast. It is easy to see that there was here a solemn lesson for the king, and that the wounding gave it its edge.] <span class="cmt_word">And the man refused to smite him.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/20-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Meanwhile, by the word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#7695;&#183;&#7687;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
