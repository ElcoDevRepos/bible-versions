The three-year timeframe suggests a temporary cessation of hostilities, which was not uncommon in the ancient Near East as nations often engaged in cycles of war and peace. This period follows the events of <a href="/1_kings/20.htm">1 Kings 20</a>, where Israel, under King Ahab, had previously been at war with Aram (Syria). The number three is often significant in the Bible, symbolizing completeness or divine intervention, though here it may simply denote a literal period of time.<p><b>without war between Aram and Israel</b><br>Aram, known today as Syria, was a significant power in the region, often in conflict with Israel. The absence of war suggests a time of political maneuvering and potential treaty negotiations. Historically, this peace could have been due to mutual exhaustion from previous conflicts or external pressures from other regional powers like Assyria. The relationship between Aram and Israel is complex, involving alliances and enmities, as seen in other biblical accounts such as <a href="/2_kings/6.htm">2 Kings 6-7</a>. This peace sets the stage for the subsequent events in <a href="/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a>, where Ahab seeks to reclaim Ramoth-gilead from Aram, indicating that the peace was fragile and politically motivated.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram</a></b><br>A region and people located in present-day Syria.

Evidently the king of Syria has recovered his independence, if not superiority; he has not restored Ramoth-gilead according to his promise; and his revived power is sufficient to cope with the united forces of Israel and Judah.

Rawlinson conjectures that it was during this period that the Assyrian invasion, under Shalmaneser II., took place.
