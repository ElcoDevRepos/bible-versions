These locations were used for both Yahweh worship and pagan rituals. Despite Asa's reforms, the high places remained, indicating the persistence of syncretism and the challenge of eradicating deeply ingrained cultural practices. This reflects the ongoing struggle in Israel to maintain pure worship, as seen in other passages like <a href="/2_kings/12-3.htm">2 Kings 12:3</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>. The presence of high places often led to idolatry, which was a recurring issue throughout Israel's history.<p><b>but Asa&#8217;s heart was fully devoted to the LORD</b><br>Asa, the king of Judah, is noted for his commitment to God, despite the incomplete religious reforms. His devotion is highlighted in <a href="/2_chronicles/14.htm">2 Chronicles 14-16</a>, where he is praised for his reliance on God and his efforts to rid Judah of idolatry. Asa's heart being "fully devoted" suggests a sincere personal faith and dedication, even if his actions did not completely align with the ideal. This phrase underscores the biblical theme that God values the heart's intentions, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances.<p><b>all his days</b><br>This phrase indicates Asa's lifelong commitment to God, contrasting with other kings who turned away from God later in life. Asa's reign is marked by periods of peace and prosperity, attributed to his faithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-6.htm">2 Chronicles 14:6-7</a>). However, his later years were marred by reliance on human alliances rather than divine guidance (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-9</a>). This serves as a reminder of the importance of perseverance in faith, a theme echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1-2</a>, which encourages believers to run the race with endurance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>Asa was the third king of the Kingdom of Judah and the son of Abijam.

Every traveller will remember the <span class="accented">Mukama</span> which crown almost every hill. The religion of the Fellahin, though nominally Mohammedan, is really, like that of China, a worship of the dead. "In almost every village of the country a small building, surmounted by a whitewashed dome, is observable, being the sacred chapel of the place; it is variously called Kubbeh, "dome," Mazor, "shrine," or Mukam, "station," the latter being a Hebrew word, used in the Bible for the places of the Canaanites (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-2.htm">Deuteronomy 2:2</a>)...
