His actions often reflected the political and military strategies of the time. Israel, under King David, was expanding its territory and influence. This phrase indicates a collective military effort, highlighting the unity and strength of Israel's forces. Joab's leadership is significant, as he was known for his loyalty to David, though his methods were sometimes ruthless.<p><b>had stayed there six months</b><br>The six-month duration suggests a prolonged military campaign, indicating the strategic importance of Edom. This extended period reflects the challenges of ancient warfare, including logistics, supply lines, and maintaining troop morale. The length of the campaign underscores the determination of Israel to secure its borders and eliminate threats.<p><b>until he had killed every male in Edom</b><br>This phrase highlights the severity of the campaign against Edom, a neighboring nation often in conflict with Israel. The complete destruction of the male population was a common ancient practice to prevent future retaliation and ensure dominance. This act fulfilled earlier prophecies and judgments against Edom, as seen in Obadiah and other prophetic books. Theologically, it reflects the divine judgment against nations opposing God's chosen people, though it raises ethical questions about warfare and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and loyalty to David, but also for his ruthless actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The united kingdom under King David and Solomon, representing God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A neighboring nation descended from Esau, often in conflict with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, under whose reign Joab served.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/edomite_campaign.htm">Edomite Campaign</a></b><br>A military campaign led by Joab to subdue Edom, resulting in the near-extermination of its male population.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Joab's actions, while militarily successful, reflect a broader theme of disobedience and its consequences, as seen in Solomon's reign.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>The near-extermination of Edom's males demonstrates God's sovereignty and justice, fulfilling prophecies and warnings given to Edom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">The Importance of Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Joab's campaign, while effective, also serves as a reminder of the importance of aligning military and political actions with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership.htm">The Role of Leadership</a></b><br>Joab's leadership, though effective, was marked by personal ambition and violence, contrasting with the ideal of godly leadership.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impact_of_sin_on_nations.htm">The Impact of Sin on Nations</a></b><br>The conflict with Edom illustrates how sin and rebellion against God can lead to national downfall and suffering.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_11_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 11:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_11_16_Disobedience_s_outcome.htm">How does 1 Kings 11:16 illustrate consequences of disobedience to God's commands?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Joab_s_actions_in_1_Kings_11_16.htm">What lessons can we learn from Joab's actions in 1 Kings 11:16?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_11_16_God_s_Israel_covenant.htm">How does 1 Kings 11:16 connect with God's covenant with Israel?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_1_Kings_11_16_today.htm">How can we apply the lessons from 1 Kings 11:16 in our lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_1_Kings_11_16_show_sin_s_persistence.htm">What does "six months" in 1 Kings 11:16 reveal about persistence in sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Joab_stay_in_Edom_6_months_2.htm">Why did Joab stay in Edom for six months according to 1 Kings 11:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_11_16_God_s_judgment_mercy.htm">How does 1 Kings 11:16 reflect on God's judgment and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_1_Kings_11_16_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in 1 Kings 11:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_kings_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Kings 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/joab's_key_bible_achievements_lessons.htm">What are Joab's key achievements and lessons in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_2_sam_11_1_match_spring_war_evidence.htm">How does 2 Samuel 11:1 align with historical or archaeological evidence that kings only went to war in the spring?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/when_did_king_baasha_die.htm">In what year of King Asa's reign did Baasha, King of Israel die?
