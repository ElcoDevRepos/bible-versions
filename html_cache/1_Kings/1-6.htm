In the biblical context, parental discipline is emphasized as a crucial aspect of raising children (<a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24, 22</a>:6). David's lack of correction may have contributed to Adonijah's sense of entitlement and ambition, as seen in his attempt to seize the throne. This failure to discipline is reminiscent of David's earlier parenting issues with Absalom, suggesting a pattern of indulgence or neglect. The absence of discipline can lead to rebellion, as seen in the broader narrative of David's family.<p><b>Adonijah was also very handsome,</b><br>The mention of Adonijah's appearance is significant in biblical narratives, where physical attractiveness often correlates with favor or leadership potential (<a href="/1_samuel/9-2.htm">1 Samuel 9:2, 16</a>:12). However, it can also be a source of pride and downfall, as seen with Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25-26</a>). The emphasis on Adonijah's handsomeness may indicate his charismatic appeal and the potential for influence, yet it also serves as a warning that external appearances do not equate to inner righteousness or divine favor.<p><b>born next after Absalom.</b><br>This phrase situates Adonijah within the family hierarchy, highlighting his position as the next eldest surviving son after Absalom's death. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, primogeniture often determined succession, but divine choice could override this custom, as seen with Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/1-17.htm">1 Kings 1:17</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>). Adonijah's birth order may have fueled his ambition for the throne, believing it was his right. The reference to Absalom also recalls the previous rebellion against David, suggesting a recurring theme of familial strife and the consequences of David's earlier failures as a father and king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, father of Adonijah, who failed to discipline his son.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>Son of David, who sought to become king without his father's approval.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>Another son of David, known for his rebellion against his father, mentioned here to highlight Adonijah's position in the family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events unfold, the political and spiritual center of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_royal_court.htm">The Royal Court</a></b><br>The setting where the dynamics of power, succession, and family relationships play out.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_parental_discipline.htm">The Importance of Parental Discipline</a></b><br>David's failure to discipline Adonijah serves as a cautionary tale about the necessity of setting boundaries and correcting children.

The phrase underscores a total absence of parental challenge.<p>&#8226; This echoes <a href="/1_samuel/3-13.htm">1 Samuel 3:13</a>, where Eli&#8217;s sons were ruined because &#8220;he did not restrain them.&#8221; The parallel warns that refusing to discipline invites disaster, no matter how godly the parent may be in other areas.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24 and 22</a>:6 affirm that loving discipline guides children toward wisdom; David&#8217;s silence left a moral vacuum.<p>&#8226; David had experienced the heartbreak of Absalom&#8217;s revolt (<a href="/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-6</a>). Yet even that tragedy did not move him to address Adonijah&#8217;s self-exaltation in <a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>.<p>&#8226; The verse therefore clarifies why Adonijah felt free to proclaim himself king: unchecked behavior in youth produced unchecked ambition in adulthood.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Adonijah was also very handsome</b><p>&#8226; Scripture notes physical beauty only when it influences events. Like Absalom&#8212;&#8220;in all Israel no one was as handsome as Absalom&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25</a>)&#8212;Adonijah&#8217;s looks helped him gather followers who judged by appearance rather than by God&#8217;s choice.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a> reminds us that &#8220;man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart&#8221;. The narrative contrasts external attractiveness with the inner humility God requires (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Adonijah relied on charisma instead of covenant. His handsomeness produced confidence, which, untempered by discipline, blossomed into presumption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Born next after Absalom</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/2_samuel/3-4.htm">2 Samuel 3:4</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1-2</a> list David&#8217;s sons; after the deaths of Amnon and Absalom, Adonijah was the eldest surviving son. By custom (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>) the firstborn&#8217;s rights would fall to him.<p>&#8226; Yet God had already signaled that Solomon, Bathsheba&#8217;s son, was His choice (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>). The verse sets up the tension: natural succession versus divine selection.<p>&#8226; By linking Adonijah to Absalom in birth order, the text invites readers to recall Absalom&#8217;s rebellion and expect a similar path. Both sons exploited position and charm to subvert God&#8217;s plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/1-6.htm">1 Kings 1:6</a> explains Adonijah&#8217;s rebellion by highlighting three factors: David&#8217;s failure to correct him, the allure of his outward beauty, and his near-firstborn status. Unchecked privilege bred entitlement; physical attractiveness bred influence; perceived right of succession bred ambition. Together they produced a coup that God overturned through Solomon, showing that divine purpose prevails over human presumption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his father had not displeased</span> [or <span class="accented">pained, afflicted.</span> The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>] <span class="cmt_word">him at any time</span> [Hebrews <span class="accented">from his days, i.e.</span>, all his days, LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, Vulg. <span class="accented">a diebus ejus.
