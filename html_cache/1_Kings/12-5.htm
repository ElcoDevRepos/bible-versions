His response here is crucial as it sets the stage for the division of the kingdom. Rehoboam's leadership is being tested, and his answer reflects his initial approach to governance. This moment is pivotal in Israel's history, as it reveals the character and decision-making style of the new king. The name Rehoboam means "he who enlarges the people," which is ironic given the impending division of the kingdom.<p><b>&#8220;Go away for three days</b><br>The request for a three-day period is significant in biblical terms, often symbolizing a period of testing, waiting, or preparation. This time frame allows Rehoboam to seek counsel and consider his response carefully. The number three is frequently seen in Scripture, such as in the resurrection of Jesus on the third day, indicating a time of transition or transformation. In this context, it suggests a pause for reflection before making a critical decision.<p><b>and then return to me.&#8221;</b><br>Rehoboam's instruction for the people to return indicates his willingness to engage with their concerns, at least superficially. This phrase shows a semblance of openness to dialogue, though it ultimately leads to a decision that will have lasting consequences. The return is meant to be a time for the people to hear the king's final decision, highlighting the importance of leadership and the weight of royal decrees in ancient Israel.<p><b>So the people departed.</b><br>The people's departure signifies their compliance with the king's request, showing respect for his authority. This moment of waiting is filled with anticipation and uncertainty, as the people hope for a favorable response to their plea for lighter burdens. The departure also foreshadows the eventual division, as the people's expectations and the king's response will determine the future unity of the nation. This phrase underscores the tension between the monarchy and the populace, a recurring theme in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Israel at this time.

Sadly, Rehoboam will later choose the latter (<a href="/1_kings/12-13.htm">1 Kings 12:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture urges leaders to seek divine wisdom before speaking. <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a> counsels, &#8220;Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him&#8221;. Rehoboam&#8217;s delay hints he knows he needs counsel, yet we will see he looks to the wrong voices.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go away for three days</b><p>Rehoboam requests time&#8212;three days&#8212;to deliberate.<p>&#8226; Practical purpose: he intends to gather advice from his father&#8217;s seasoned elders and his own peers. Time can slow rashness and open space for reflection (<a href="/proverbs/19-2.htm">Proverbs 19:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual resonance: &#8220;three days&#8221; often marks turning points in Scripture. Moses asked Pharaoh for &#8220;a three-day journey into the wilderness&#8221; to worship (<a href="/exodus/8-27.htm">Exodus 8:27</a>). Most powerfully, Jesus rose &#8220;on the third day&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-7.htm">Luke 24:7</a>). Though Rehoboam&#8217;s three days are merely political, the pattern reminds us that God often works through periods of waiting to reveal hearts and purposes.<p>&#8226; Personal application: when faced with major decisions, a pause for prayerful counsel protects us from impulsive choices.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>then return to me</b><p>The king promises a second audience.<p>&#8226; An open door: by inviting them back, Rehoboam signals willingness&#8212;at least outwardly&#8212;to listen. <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a> offers a similar invitation from the Lord: &#8220;You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Responsibility on the hearers: the people must choose to return. Jesus echoes this dynamic invitation in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>, &#8220;Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Leadership lesson: commitments to revisit an issue mean little unless the heart behind them is genuine. True servants keep their word and seek the good of those they lead (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the people departed</b><p>The assembly obeys and disperses, trusting the king&#8217;s word.<p>&#8226; Their compliance highlights how much hope they place in him. Three days later they will indeed &#8220;return to Rehoboam, as the king had directed&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/12-12.htm">1 Kings 12:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene echoes Israel&#8217;s earlier request for a king in <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>, where God tells Samuel, &#8220;They have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me as their king&#8221;. The people again look to human leadership for relief; the outcome will depend on the king&#8217;s submission to God.<p>&#8226; Sadly, Rehoboam&#8217;s eventual harsh answer will fracture the kingdom. The people departing in orderly hope contrasts sharply with the chaos that follows when leaders ignore godly counsel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/12-5.htm">1 Kings 12:5</a> captures a brief pause pregnant with possibilities. Rehoboam&#8217;s measured words hint at wisdom&#8212;he asks for time and promises a reply. Yet the verse also prepares us for a test: will he humble himself, seek the Lord, and answer gently, or will pride prevail? The people wait in faith; the king must decide whose counsel he values more&#8212;elders grounded in Solomon&#8217;s legacy or peers driven by youthful bravado. This single verse invites every reader to handle leadership moments with prayerful patience, to honor commitments made, and to remember that in every decision, seeking God&#8217;s wisdom first is the surest path to unity and blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days</span> [so as to afford time for counsel and deliberation. It has been assumed that both the old and young advisers of Rehoboam had been taken by him, as part of his retinue, to Shechem (Bahr). But it is quite as likely that some of them were summoned from Jerusalem to advise him, and that the three days' delay was in order to give time for their attendance. It is a long day's journey (12 hours) from Nablus to Jerusalem. Three days, consequently, would just afford sufficient time for the purpose] <span class="cmt_word">then come again to me, And the people departed.</span> [The peaceable departure, like the respect-tiff demand, contradicts the idea of a settled purpose to rebel.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/12-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Rehoboam answered,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
