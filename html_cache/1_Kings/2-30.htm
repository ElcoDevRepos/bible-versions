This tent, likely a reference to the tabernacle, was a place of worship and sacrifice, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The act of entering this holy place underscores the gravity of the situation, as Joab had sought asylum there, believing it to be a place of refuge. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice where altars or sacred spaces were sometimes seen as places of sanctuary.<p><b>and said to Joab, &#8220;The king says, &#8216;Come out!&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Joab, a former commander of Israel's army under King David, had fled to the tent seeking protection from Solomon's judgment. Benaiah's message from the king is a direct order, emphasizing Solomon's authority and the expectation of obedience. This moment highlights the transition of power from David to Solomon and the enforcement of justice in the new king's reign. Joab's past actions, including the murders of Abner and Amasa, had made him a target for retribution, fulfilling David's dying instructions to Solomon to deal with Joab's bloodguilt.<p><b>But Joab replied, &#8220;No, I will die here.&#8221;</b><br>Joab's refusal to leave the tent signifies his desperation and acknowledgment of his impending fate. By choosing to die at the altar, Joab attempts to invoke the sanctity of the place as a final act of defiance or perhaps as a plea for divine mercy. This response can be seen as a reflection of Joab's character&#8212;bold, unyielding, and willing to face death on his own terms. His decision also highlights the tension between human justice and divine sanctuary, a theme present in other biblical narratives.<p><b>So Benaiah relayed the message to the king, saying, &#8220;This is how Joab answered me.&#8221;</b><br>Benaiah's role as a messenger underscores his loyalty and obedience to King Solomon. By reporting Joab's words back to the king, Benaiah ensures that Solomon is fully informed and can make a decisive judgment. This act of communication reflects the importance of accountability and transparency in leadership. Solomon's subsequent decision to have Joab executed at the altar demonstrates the king's commitment to justice and the fulfillment of his father's wishes, reinforcing the establishment of his rule and the cleansing of his kingdom from bloodguilt.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benaiah.htm">Benaiah</a></b><br>A loyal servant of King Solomon, Benaiah was a valiant warrior and leader of the king's bodyguard.

&#8220;So Benaiah relayed the message to the king, saying, &#8216;This is how Joab answered me.&#8217;&#8221; Faithful messengers report without embellishment (<a href="/proverbs/13-17.htm">Proverbs 13:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Benaiah&#8217;s restraint shows respect for both sanctuary protocol and the chain of command; he will not act until Solomon clarifies (compare <a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment emphasizes accountability: Joab&#8217;s fate will rest on the king&#8217;s word, reflecting <a href="/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a>&#8212;&#8220;He who rules righteously&#8230;rules in the fear of God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/2-30.htm">1 Kings 2:30</a> portrays a real event in which God-ordained authority confronts unrepentant guilt. Joab, though at the altar, cannot escape justice; sanctuary offers no shelter for bloodshed. Benaiah&#8217;s obedience, Solomon&#8217;s resolve, and Scripture&#8217;s unwavering standard affirm that righteousness and judgment proceed hand in hand, fulfilling David&#8217;s charge and upholding divine law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said unto him</span> [Benaiah evidently "hesitated to stain the altar with blood." It was only the sanctity of the altar which made it an asylum. There was strictly no "right of sanctuary"], <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the king, Come forth.</span> [Probably Solomon bad directed that Joab should, if possible, be induced to leave the altar. Every Jew would dread its profanation by strife and bloodshed.] <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Nay; but I will die here.</span> [Heb. "<span class="accented">here</span> <span class="accented">will I die."</span> Joab may possibly have thought that Solomon would hardly venture to put him to death there, and that so he might somehow escape with his life. But it is more probable that he counted on death, and that a feeling of superstition, or of defiance, had decided him to meet his doom there. It should be borne in mind that gross superstition not uncommonly accompanies irreligion and brutality; and it is quite conceivable that Joab hoped for some indefinable benefit from the shadow of the altar, much as the poor Polish Jew expects from burial in Jerusalem. Or his motive may have been defiance, thinking he would "render Solomon odious to the people, as a profaner of the Holy Place" (M. Henry). It can hardly have been to put off forever so short a time the execution, as Bishop Hall imagines.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/2-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Benaiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1141.htm">Strong's 1141: </a> </span><span class="str2">Benaiah -- 'Yah has built up', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">entered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
