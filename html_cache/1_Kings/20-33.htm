After a series of defeats, they are desperate for a favorable outcome. This phrase highlights the human tendency to seek hope even in dire circumstances. Biblically, hope is often associated with trust in God's deliverance, as seen in Psalms and the Prophets. Here, however, the hope is placed in human negotiation rather than divine intervention.<p><b>and they quickly grasped at this word</b><br>The servants of Ben-hadad are quick to seize any opportunity for mercy. This reflects the urgency and desperation of their situation. In the ancient Near Eastern context, words and treaties were often seen as binding, and the servants are attempting to secure a favorable outcome through diplomacy. This can be contrasted with the biblical emphasis on God's word as the ultimate source of truth and hope.<p><b>and replied, &#8220;Yes, your brother Ben-hadad.&#8221;</b><br>Referring to Ben-hadad as "your brother" is a diplomatic strategy to appeal to King Ahab's sense of kinship and alliance. In ancient times, calling someone "brother" was a way to establish a bond or treaty. This phrase can be compared to the biblical concept of brotherhood among believers, which is based on spiritual kinship rather than political expediency.<p><b>&#8220;Go and get him!&#8221; said the king.</b><br>King Ahab's response indicates a willingness to negotiate and show mercy. This decision is significant in the historical context, as it reflects Ahab's political strategy rather than adherence to divine command. Ahab's actions can be contrasted with the biblical expectation of kings to follow God's directives, as seen in the lives of other Israelite leaders.<p><b>Then Ben-hadad came out,</b><br>Ben-hadad's emergence signifies a shift in the power dynamics. Historically, this moment represents a temporary reconciliation between Israel and Aram. Theologically, it can be seen as a missed opportunity for Ahab to assert God's sovereignty over Israel's enemies, as God had previously delivered Aram into Ahab's hands.<p><b>and Ahab had him come up into his chariot.</b><br>Inviting Ben-hadad into his chariot symbolizes acceptance and alliance. In ancient cultures, sharing a chariot was a sign of friendship and partnership. This act can be seen as a failure on Ahab's part to uphold God's command to destroy Israel's enemies, as outlined in earlier scriptures. It contrasts with the biblical theme of separation from ungodly alliances, as emphasized in the laws given to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his idolatry and weak leadership, often influenced by his wife Jezebel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria), who had previously attacked Israel but was now seeking mercy from Ahab.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men.htm">The Men</a></b><br>Servants or messengers of Ben-hadad, who were seeking a favorable response from Ahab.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/chariot.htm">Chariot</a></b><br>A symbol of power and status, indicating Ahab's acceptance and alliance with Ben-hadad.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel_and_aram.htm">Israel and Aram</a></b><br>Two neighboring nations often in conflict, with Israel under Ahab's rule and Aram under Ben-hadad.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_alliances.htm">Discernment in Alliances</a></b><br>Ahab's decision to ally with Ben-hadad was based on political expediency rather than seeking God's will. Believers should seek God's guidance in forming relationships and alliances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Ahab's actions demonstrate the danger of compromising God's commands for personal gain or peace. Christians are called to stand firm in their faith and convictions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_human_responsibility.htm">God's Sovereignty and Human Responsibility</a></b><br>Despite God's deliverance, Ahab's failure to act according to God's will shows the tension between divine sovereignty and human responsibility. Believers must align their actions with God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>The men quickly grasped Ahab's words as a sign of hope. This highlights the power of words and the importance of speaking truth and life in our interactions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_obedience.htm">Repentance and Obedience</a></b><br>Ahab's account is a reminder of the need for genuine repentance and obedience to God.

But the general sense seems accurately rendered by our version. "The men watched" ("as for augury," says the LXX.), "and hasted, and caught up" (so as to make it sure) "what fell from him." What follows may be a question, "Is Ben-hadad thy brother?" but probably the simple acceptance of the title is better. The whole description is graphic. The Syrians speak of "thy slave Ben-hadad." Ahab, in compassion or show of magnanimity, says, "my brother." Eagerly the ambassadors catch up the word, which, according to Eastern custom, implied a pledge of amity not to be recalled; and Ahab accepts their inference, and seals it publicly by taking the conquered king into his chariot. (Comp. <a href="/context/2_kings/10-15.htm" title="And when he was departed there, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.">2Kings 10:15-16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the men did diligently observe whether anything would come from him and did hastily catch it</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and the men augured -</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5da;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5da;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5da;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>.
