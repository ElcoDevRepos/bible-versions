Egypt was renowned for its chariotry, and the importation of chariots from Egypt indicates a strong trade relationship and the value placed on Egyptian craftsmanship. Six hundred shekels of silver was a substantial amount, reflecting the high cost and value of these military vehicles. This trade highlights Solomon's wealth and the extensive reach of his kingdom's economy. The use of silver as currency underscores the economic practices of the time, where precious metals were standard for trade.<p><b>and a horse for a hundred and fifty</b><br>Horses were essential for chariots and cavalry, and their importation from Egypt suggests a focus on building military strength. The price of a horse, at one hundred and fifty shekels, indicates their value and the importance of maintaining a strong and well-equipped army. This trade also reflects the broader Near Eastern practice of horse trading, which was crucial for maintaining military and trade networks. The emphasis on horses and chariots in Solomon's reign can be seen as a fulfillment of the warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, where kings were cautioned against amassing horses, especially from Egypt.<p><b>Likewise, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram</b><br>Solomon's kingdom acted as a middleman in the trade of horses and chariots, exporting them to neighboring regions such as the Hittite and Aramean kingdoms. This indicates the strategic position of Israel in international trade routes and its influence in the region. The Hittites and Arameans were significant powers in the ancient Near East, and trade with them would have strengthened political alliances and economic ties. This exportation also demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to make Israel a nation of influence and prosperity. The mention of these specific kingdoms highlights the geopolitical landscape of the time, where trade and military alliances were crucial for maintaining power and security.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel during this time, known for his wisdom and wealth.

That is roughly fifteen pounds of silver, an enormous sum in the ancient Near East&#8212;evidence of Solomon&#8217;s staggering wealth and of a flourishing, sophisticated trade network.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/1-17.htm">2 Chronicles 1:17</a> echoes the same figure, confirming the historicity: &#8220;A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and in the same way they were exported&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Solomon had already amassed &#8220;1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>). Adding hundreds more would make Israel a regional military power.<p>&#8226; Why Egypt?<p>&#8211; Egyptian chariots were the best engineered of the day, refined over centuries of warfare (cf. <a href="/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6-7</a>).<p>&#8211; Israel&#8217;s southern border touched the Sinai trade routes, making Egypt the logical supplier.<p>&#8226; The verse therefore pictures Solomon leveraging his God-given wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/10-24.htm">1 Kings 10:24</a>) to procure top-tier technology, though the high price whispers a warning: vast resources are being poured into military hardware.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a horse for a hundred and fifty</b><p>&#8226; At one-quarter the price of a chariot, each Egyptian horse cost &#8220;a hundred and fifty&#8221; shekels of silver. Horses were the engine of any chariot corps, so Israel&#8217;s king was investing heavily in an integrated fighting force.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a> cautioned future kings: &#8220;The king must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them&#8221;. Solomon is doing precisely what Moses warned against&#8212;multiplying horses and partnering with Egypt.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28</a> notes the supply chain: &#8220;Solomon&#8217;s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue&#8221;. The demand for horses extended beyond Egypt, showing an appetite for power that would later pull Israel toward compromise (cf. <a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical implications seen in Samuel&#8217;s earlier warning: a king would &#8220;take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and horses&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>). The text hints that centralized power grows heavier on the people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Likewise, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram</b><p>&#8226; Solomon was not only a buyer; he became a broker, reselling Egyptian chariots and horses &#8220;to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This places Israel at the commercial crossroads:<p>&#8211; Northward to the Hittite states in Anatolia and Syria.<p>&#8211; Northeast to the Aramean kingdoms around Damascus.<p>&#8226; The practice created:<p>&#8211; Diplomatic leverage&#8212;client states depended on Solomon&#8217;s supply chain (cf. <a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>: &#8220;Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt,&#8221;).<p>&#8211; Economic reward&#8212;profit margins on each transaction enriched the royal treasury (cf. <a href="/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>: Solomon made silver &#8220;as common in Jerusalem as stones,&#8221;).<p>&#8211; Regional stability of sorts&#8212;trading partners hesitate to fight the merchant king who arms them.<p>&#8226; Yet this export business underscores a spiritual risk: alliances forged through arms trade often came with political marriages and idolatries (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-2</a>). The long-term cost would outweigh the short-term gain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a> records more than a simple price list; it exposes Solomon&#8217;s vast wealth, administrative genius, and expanding influence. He bought elite Egyptian chariots for 600 shekels and horses for 150, then capitalized on the market by reselling to surrounding kingdoms. The verse celebrates Israel&#8217;s golden-age prosperity yet quietly signals trouble: Solomon is amassing horses in open defiance of <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a> and entangling Israel with Egypt. Material success, when severed from wholehearted obedience, plants seeds that will later fracture the kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">A chariot</span>.--This is the chariot and its team of two or three horses; the "horse" is the charger. The price (though so far considerable as to indicate a large expenditure on the whole) shows that the supply was large, and the commerce regular.<p><span class= "bld">The kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria</span>--evidently allies or tributaries of Solomon, who were allowed, or compelled, to purchase their horses and chariots through his merchants. Of all the earlier inhabitants of Palestine the Hittites alone are mentioned as having existed in power after the conquest (as here and in <a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm" title="For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, See, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.">2Kings 7:6</a>); and this statement is curiously confirmed by both Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions, describing a powerful confederacy of Hittites in the valley of the Orontes in Syria, not far from Ph?nicia, with whom both empires waged war. The possession of horses and chariots by the northern confederacy round Hazor is especially noted in the history of the Conquest (<a href="/context/joshua/11-4.htm" title="And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is on the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.">Joshua 11:4-6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a chariot</span> [including perhaps the two or three horses (see note on 1 Kings 5:6) usually attached to a chariot, and the harness. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span> is used (<a href="/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-18.htm">2 Samuel 10:18</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/39-20.htm">Ezekiel 39:20</a>) for <span class="accented">chariot and horses</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver</span> [about &pound;80 (Wordsworth, &pound;35), but, as these figures show, the precise value cannot be ascertained with certainty.

The word is probably used somewhat loosely of the semi-independent tribes bordering on Palestine, the <span class="accented">Khatti</span> of the Assyrian inscriptions (Dict. Bib. 1:819), with whom Solomon had a sort of alliance. It is a curious coincidence that we find horses and chariots associated in popular estimation with the Hittites, at a later period of the history (<a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>). Nor are we justified in supposing that these horses and chariots were furnished as cavalry to "Solomon's vassals, whose armies were at his disposal, if he required their aid" (Rawlinson), for the kings of Syria are mentioned presently, and some of these at least were enemies to Solomon.
