This opulence is a testament to God's blessing upon Solomon, fulfilling the promise of wisdom and wealth given in <a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>. The lavishness of the meals also signifies the peace and stability of Solomon's reign, a time when Israel was at its zenith in terms of political and economic power.<p><b>the seating of his servants</b><br>The organized seating of Solomon's servants indicates a well-ordered and hierarchical court. This structure reflects the wisdom and administrative skills of Solomon, who was known for his ability to govern effectively. The seating arrangement also symbolizes the respect and honor given to those who serve in the king's presence, reminiscent of the order and reverence in the heavenly court as seen in <a href="/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>.<p><b>the service and attire of his attendants</b><br>The service and attire of Solomon's attendants demonstrate the splendor and dignity of his court. The attendants' clothing likely included fine fabrics and intricate designs, showcasing the wealth and cultural sophistication of Israel under Solomon's rule. This grandeur can be seen as a type of the heavenly kingdom, where believers are clothed in righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>) and serve the King of Kings with reverence and joy.<p><b>his cupbearers</b><br>The role of the cupbearer was one of great trust and responsibility, as they ensured the safety and quality of the king's drink. This position highlights the loyalty and dedication required of those who serve in close proximity to the king. Nehemiah, a later biblical figure, also served as a cupbearer, illustrating the importance and influence of this role in royal courts (<a href="/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Nehemiah 1:11</a>).<p><b>and the burnt offerings he presented at the house of the LORD</b><br>Solomon's presentation of burnt offerings at the temple underscores his devotion and obedience to God. These offerings were a central aspect of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to the LORD. The temple, which Solomon built, was the focal point of Israel's religious life and a fulfillment of God's promise to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>). The offerings also prefigure the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself as the perfect atonement for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>it took her breath away</b><br>The Queen of Sheba's reaction to Solomon's wisdom and the splendor of his court highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to make Solomon renowned among the nations (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12-13</a>). Her amazement serves as a testament to the divine wisdom bestowed upon Solomon, which foreshadows the greater wisdom and glory of Jesus Christ, who is greater than Solomon (<a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>). This encounter also illustrates the drawing of the nations to the light of God's people, a theme echoed in the prophetic vision of the nations coming to Zion (<a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The King of Israel, renowned for his wisdom, wealth, and the grandeur of his kingdom.

The bounty declared that covenant blessing was flowing through the king to the nation, echoing the provision God promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-11.htm">Deuteronomy 28:11</a>. The table became a visual sermon: when a ruler walks in God&#8217;s ways, even the mundane act of eating proclaims divine favor (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the seating of his servants</b><p>Order and honor marked every level of Solomon&#8217;s court.

Herodotus notes that pagan courts used seating to display hierarchy; here the arrangement testified to the God of Israel, whose wisdom organizes society (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-23</a>). The queen saw that those who served Solomon did so with dignity, reflecting <a href="/1_kings/4-27.htm">1 Kings 4:27</a>&#8217;s statement that the officers &#8220;left nothing lacking.&#8221; A well-ordered house mirrors a well-ordered heart submitted to God (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the service and attire of his attendants</b><p>The attendants&#8217; precise duties and splendid clothing illustrated the excellence demanded in God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2</a>).

Burnt offerings symbolized total devotion (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>); Solomon&#8217;s consistent sacrifices affirmed <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>, which commands the king to revere God&#8217;s Word. By linking royal splendor to sincere worship, the narrative teaches that national prosperity is inseparable from obedience (<a href="/psalms/33-12.htm">Psalm 33:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it took her breath away</b><p>&#8220;When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon&#8230; and the burnt offerings he presented at the house of the LORD, it took her breath away&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/10-4.htm">1 Kings 10:4-5</a>).

The scene previews the greater King&#8212;Jesus&#8212;whose wisdom and glory will leave every nation in awe (<a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every detail&#8212;abundant food, orderly seating, dignified servants, vigilant cupbearers, and wholehearted worship&#8212;declared that Solomon&#8217;s wisdom came from the Lord and blessed all under his rule. The queen&#8217;s stunned reaction proves that genuine godliness is both practical and breathtaking, drawing outsiders to glorify God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the meat of his table</span> [<a href="/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22, 23</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and the sitting</span> ["The rooms of the courtiers in attendance" (Keil).

But ver. 8 appears to be decisive against this view] <span class="cmt_word">of his ministers</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, those who ministered to him. The word "servants" is, perhaps, to be understood of state officers; the word "ministers" of personal attendants (as in <a href="/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a>, etc.) That the latter were an inferior class, the "standing" shows], <span class="cmt_word">and their apparel</span> [cf. <a href="/matthew/6-29.htm">Matthew 6:29</a>.

But see <a href="/2_chronicles/9-4.htm">2 Chronicles 9:4</a>, "cupbearers (same word) and <span class="accented">their apparel"</span>], <span class="cmt_word">and his ascent</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;</span>. It is somewhat doubtful whether we are to interpret this word, <span class="accented">ascent</span>, or <span class="accented">burnt offering</span>. <a href="/2_kings/16-18.htm">2 Kings 16:18</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/26-16.htm">1 Chronicles 26:16</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a> make for the former, and the chronicler has <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;</span>. which undoubtedly means "ascent." But all the translations understand the word of burnt offerings - the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x28;</span> and the word, "which occurs at least 300 times in the Bible," always (with one exception) signifies burnt offering. It is objected against this interpretation <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that we should require the plural, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "burnt offerings;" but this is by no means certain, as the historian may refer to one particular holocaust (see <a href="/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a>) which the queen witnessed; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the sight of burnt offerings could not have caused her any astonishment (Keil). But their prodigious <span class="accented">number</span> may surely have done so; and we are certainly to understand that Solomon was remarkable for the <span class="accented">scale</span> of his sacrifices. Considering, however, that the word undoubtedly means "ascent" in <a href="/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a>, and that it is so paraphrased by the chronicler, it is perhaps safer to retain this rendering here]; <span class="cmt_word">there was no more spirit in her</span> [same expression <a href="/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>, and cf. 2:11.
