Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, ruled over Judah, while Jeroboam, an official under Solomon, led the northern tribes in rebellion, forming the kingdom of Israel. This division was a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). The strife between these two houses represents the broader spiritual and political division within the nation of Israel, which was a consequence of Solomon's idolatry and disobedience to God (<a href="/1_kings/11-9.htm">1 Kings 11:9-13</a>). The conflict between these two kingdoms is a recurring theme throughout the books of Kings and Chronicles, illustrating the consequences of turning away from God's covenant.<p><b>all the days of Abijam&#8217;s life.</b><br>Abijam, also known as Abijah, was the son of Rehoboam and reigned over Judah for a short period (<a href="/1_kings/15.htm">1 Kings 15:1-2</a>). His reign was marked by continued hostilities with Jeroboam, indicating that the division and conflict initiated by their predecessors persisted. Abijam's reign is described as being similar to that of his father, Rehoboam, in that he did not fully commit to following the Lord (<a href="/1_kings/15-3.htm">1 Kings 15:3</a>). This ongoing war can be seen as a reflection of the spiritual state of the nation, where the kings of Judah and Israel often failed to lead their people in faithfulness to God. The chronic conflict serves as a backdrop to the narrative of the kings, emphasizing the need for a righteous leader, ultimately pointing to the future hope of a perfect king in Jesus Christ, who would bring true peace and unity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah.

Thenius thinks the insertion of the words were due to the carelessness of some copyist, and Bahr admits that our present text is possibly not the original one. For <span class="accented">Rehoboam</span>, some MSS., with the Syriac and Arabic, read <span class="accented">Abijah</span>, but this is clearly an emendation, which in turn begets another repetition (ver. 7), and there is really no need either to alter or suspect the text. Such repetitions are quite in accordance with Eastern usage, and Rehoboam here stands for the house of Rehoboam, or the cause and kingdom which Rehoboam represented. The object of mentioning his name can hardly be "to remind the reader that Abijam inherited this war from his father" (Rawlinson), for it was only on Rehoboam's death that the slumbering hostility blazed out into actual war.
