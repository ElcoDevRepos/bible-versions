The fifteenth day of the eighth month does not correspond to any God-ordained festival in the Mosaic Law, indicating Jeroboam's intention to innovate religious practices for political purposes. This act reflects a departure from the divinely instituted calendar, as the Feast of Tabernacles in Judah occurred on the fifteenth day of the seventh month (<a href="/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34</a>).<p><b>like the feast that was in Judah</b><br>Jeroboam's feast was modeled after the Feast of Tabernacles, a significant festival in Judah that celebrated the harvest and God's provision. By imitating this feast, Jeroboam sought to legitimize his new religious practices and provide an alternative for the northern tribes, preventing them from traveling to Jerusalem. This imitation underscores the tension between the northern and southern kingdoms and highlights Jeroboam's desire to consolidate his rule by establishing a separate religious identity.<p><b>and he offered sacrifices on the altar</b><br>Jeroboam's offering of sacrifices was a direct challenge to the Levitical priesthood and the centralized worship in Jerusalem. By performing sacrifices himself, Jeroboam assumed a priestly role, which was contrary to the Law that reserved such duties for the descendants of Aaron. This act of offering sacrifices on an unauthorized altar was a significant deviation from the prescribed worship and demonstrated Jeroboam's disregard for the established religious order.<p><b>he made this offering in Bethel</b><br>Bethel, meaning "house of God," was a significant location in Israel's history, associated with patriarchal worship (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>). Jeroboam's choice of Bethel as a site for his altar was strategic, as it held historical and religious significance. However, by setting up a rival altar there, Jeroboam corrupted its legacy and turned it into a center of idolatry, as Bethel became one of the two main centers for his golden calf worship.<p><b>to sacrifice to the calves he had set up</b><br>The golden calves were a direct violation of the second commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>). Jeroboam's establishment of calf worship was reminiscent of Aaron's sin at Mount Sinai (Exodus 32), indicating a regression into idolatry. This act was a political maneuver to prevent the people from returning to Jerusalem, but it led Israel into sin and idolatry, which had long-lasting consequences for the northern kingdom.<p><b>and he installed priests in Bethel for the high places he had set up</b><br>Jeroboam's installation of non-Levitical priests was a further departure from the Mosaic Law, which specified that only Levites could serve as priests (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>). By appointing his own priests, Jeroboam created a parallel religious system that lacked divine sanction. The high places, often associated with pagan worship, became centers of idolatry, contributing to the spiritual decline of Israel. This action set a precedent for future kings of Israel, who continued in the sins of Jeroboam, leading to the eventual downfall of the northern kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

The fixing of Jeroboam's festival of dedication for the Temple at Bethel to this special day is characteristic. It at once challenged likeness to the Feast of Tabernacles, which was (see <a href="/1_kings/8-2.htm" title="And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.">1Kings 8:2</a>) the occasion of Solomon's dedication at Jerusalem, and yet took liberty to alter the date, and fix it in the month "which he had devised of his own heart," thus assuming the right to set aside the letter of the old law, while professing still to observe the worship of Jehovah.<p><span class= "bld">Offered</span>--or (see margin) <span class= "ital">went up</span>--upon the altar.--The expression seems to imply that he ventured on a still greater innovation by taking on himself both functions of the priestly office--to offer sacrifice and (see <a href="/1_kings/12-33.htm" title="So he offered on the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast to the children of Israel: and he offered on the altar, and burnt incense.">1Kings 12:33</a>) to burn incense. This is not, indeed, necessarily implied; for (see <a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm" title="And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.">1Kings 8:63</a>) the sacrificer is often said to offer, when he evidently does so only through the priests. But Jeroboam had set aside the peculiar sanctity of the Levitical priesthood already; and so was very naturally prepared to crown this process by acting as head of the unauthorised priesthood which he had created. Perhaps he had witnessed the exclusive prominence of Solomon at the great dedication festival, and desired to imitate and outdo it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Feast of Tabernacles, which was held on the 15th of the <span class="accented">seventh</span> month (cf. <a href="/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>). This was the great feast of the year, and, as the feast of harvest or ingathering, the most joyous. See on 1 Kings 8:1. Had Jeroboam provided no counter attraction to this great festive gathering in Judah he might have found it a formidable temptation to his subjects. The reason usually given for the alteration of the time - in defiance of the law, which expressly fixed it in the seventh month (<a href="/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34, 39, 41</a>) - is that the eighth would be more generally convenient in the north, where the harvest or vintage was a month later (Then., Keil), as affording more time for the ingathering. In favour of this view is the consideration that the Jews not unfrequently had to intercalate a month - a second Adar - into their year, because of the season being a late one. Some of the older commentators, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., Vatab., think this time was chosen as the anniversary of his secession, but this is pure conjecture, and such an association would be contrary to the genius of the Hebrew people. Keil maintains that Jeroboam's design was to "make the separation, in a religious point of view, as complete as possible." But we can hardly be expected to believe that he altered the <span class="accented">month</span>, for the sake of creating a distinction, but "retained the <span class="accented">day</span> of the month, the fifteenth, for the sake of the weak who took offence at his innovations" (Keil). The day was retained, as Bahr points out, because, the months being lunar, the fifteenth was the day of the full moon], <span class="cmt_word">and he offered</span> [Heb. as marg., "<span class="accented">and he went up</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, ascended the altar; LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>. (Keil contends that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> means "and he sacrificed," but this translation is without precedent. Ver. 33, "and he went up <span class="accented">to</span> <span class="accented">burn incense</span> is decisive as to the meaning.) the altar was always raised. It was probably approached by s slope, as <a href="/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a> forbade steps, though it is by no means certain that they were not used even in Solomon's temple, and Jeroboam probably would have no scruples on such a minute point of ritual. It has been thought (Kitto, 4:147) that he was moved to officiate in person by the precedent of the Egyptian kings, who exercised priestly functions; but it is much more probable that he was guided by the example of Solomon at the dedication of the temple] <span class="cmt_word">upon</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, he stood upon the ledge or platform (called in the A.V. "compass," <a href="/exodus/27-5.htm">Exodus 27:5</a>) in the middle of the altar] <span class="cmt_word">the altar. So did he in Bethel</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the feast was held at one centre only, and at Bethel alone the king offered in person. But I venture to suggest that instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, "so did he," etc., we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. The LXX. seem to have had this word before them - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>. And not only does this slight change bring the Hebrew into harmony with the LXX., but it also simplifies the construction. "He went up upon the altar which he made to sacrifice unto the calves which he made." The very tautology is instructive, as suggesting that altar, calves, and priests were all of Jeroboam's making, not of God's ordaining. The use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;</span> as a relative ( = <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) is strictly grammatical], <span class="cmt_word">sacrificing</span> [marg., to <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>] <span class="cmt_word">unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel</span> [Dan being already provided with its priesthood] <span class="cmt_word">the priests of the high places</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of "the house of high places" (ver. 31).
