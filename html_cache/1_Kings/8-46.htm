This is consistent with passages like <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, which states, "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." The context here is Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the temple, where he intercedes for the people of Israel, recognizing their propensity to sin against God.<p><b>for there is no one who does not sin</b><br>This echoes the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>, which says, "Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins." It underscores the doctrine of original sin, emphasizing the need for divine grace and forgiveness. This acknowledgment of universal sinfulness sets the stage for the necessity of a savior, pointing forward to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<p><b>and You become angry with them</b><br>God's anger is a response to sin and disobedience, reflecting His holiness and justice. Throughout the Old Testament, God's anger is depicted as a righteous response to the covenant violations by His people. This is seen in the cycles of sin, judgment, and deliverance in the Book of Judges, where Israel repeatedly turns away from God, inciting His anger.<p><b>and deliver them to an enemy</b><br>This phrase refers to the consequences of Israel's disobedience, often resulting in military defeat and subjugation by foreign powers. Historical examples include the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles, where Israel and Judah were conquered and taken captive. This reflects the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to being handed over to enemies.<p><b>who takes them as captives to his own land</b><br>The exile is a significant theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing both judgment and the hope of restoration. The Babylonian exile, in particular, is a pivotal event, leading to a period of reflection and repentance among the Israelites. This captivity serves as a backdrop for prophetic books like Daniel and Ezekiel, which offer hope for future redemption.<p><b>whether far or near</b><br>This indicates the extent of the dispersion, suggesting that the consequences of sin can lead to separation from the land God promised to His people, regardless of distance. It highlights the severity of divine judgment but also sets the stage for the promise of regathering and restoration, as seen in prophecies like those in <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a>, where God promises to gather His people from distant lands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who is offering a prayer of dedication for the newly built temple in Jerusalem.

We must be aware of the spiritual consequences of our actions and strive to live in obedience to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteous_judgment.htm">God's Righteous Judgment</a></b><br>God's response to sin is just, and He may use circumstances, such as captivity, to discipline His people.

This echoes earlier warnings that disobedience is never hypothetical but inevitable (<a href="/1_kings/8-33.htm">1 Kings 8:33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>). The phrase reminds us that sin is an act against a personal God, not merely the breaking of an impersonal rule. &#8226; David spoke this same way after his failure: &#8220;Against You, You only, have I sinned&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>). &#8226; Whenever we choose our own way, we do what the people in the wilderness did&#8212;&#8220;tested God in their heart&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/78-18.htm">Psalm 78:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for there is no one who does not sin</b><p>The Holy Spirit inserts this parenthetical to erase any illusion of moral exception. Solomon is agreeing with <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>&#8212;&#8220;Surely there is no righteous man on earth who does good and never sins&#8221;&#8212;and anticipating Paul&#8217;s &#8220;all have sinned&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). Even the most faithful Israelite still needed the daily sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/4-27.htm">Leviticus 4:27-31</a>). In the New Covenant, the principle remains: &#8220;If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and You become angry with them</b><p>God&#8217;s anger is never capricious. It is the righteous response of a holy covenant-keeping Lord to covenant-breaking people (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24-28</a>). &#8226; &#8220;God is a righteous judge, a God who displays His wrath every day&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>). &#8226; In loving discipline He corrects His people so they will &#8220;share in His holiness&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10-11</a>). Solomon knows this anger is not the loss of divine patience but the expression of divine faithfulness to His own standards.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and deliver them to an enemy</b><p>The LORD often uses surrounding nations as a rod of correction. <a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a> notes, &#8220;He sold them into the hands of their enemies.&#8221; Later history bears this out&#8212;Assyria against the Northern Kingdom (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>), Babylon against Judah (<a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2-4</a>). Such deliverance is not defeat of God&#8217;s power but demonstration of it; He rules even foreign armies (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who takes them as captives to his own land, whether far or near</b><p>Captivity is the tangible outcome of persistent rebellion. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36, 64</a> predicted that disobedience would scatter the people &#8220;from one end of the earth to the other.&#8221; Some would be marched only a short distance; others, hundreds of miles to Babylon or, centuries later, across the Roman world (<a href="/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5-11</a>). Yet even in exile God remains near (<a href="/jeremiah/29-4.htm">Jeremiah 29:4-14</a>), turning captivity into a stage for renewal (<a href="/nehemiah/1-8.htm">Nehemiah 1:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/8-46.htm">1 Kings 8:46</a> teaches that sin is universal, God&#8217;s anger against it is just, and His disciplinary hand can include foreign captivity.
