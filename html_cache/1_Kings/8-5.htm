It symbolized God's presence among His people. The ark was placed in the Most Holy Place of the temple, signifying the centrality of God's law and covenant. This moment marks the culmination of Solomon's efforts to build a permanent dwelling for the ark, transitioning from the tabernacle to the temple.<p><b>King Solomon and the whole congregation of Israel</b><br>King Solomon, the son of David, was known for his wisdom and for building the temple. His leadership in this event underscores his role as a mediator between God and the people. The "whole congregation of Israel" indicates a national gathering, emphasizing unity and collective worship. This assembly reflects the importance of communal participation in worship and covenant renewal.<p><b>who had assembled with him</b><br>The assembly of the people with Solomon highlights the significance of corporate worship and the communal aspect of Israel's relationship with God. This gathering was not just a royal event but a national one, involving representatives from all tribes, signifying the unity of the nation under God's covenant.<p><b>sacrificed so many sheep and oxen</b><br>The act of sacrifice was central to Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement, thanksgiving, and dedication to God. The large number of sacrifices indicates the magnitude of the occasion and the people's devotion. Sacrifices were a way to express gratitude and seek God's favor, and they foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.<p><b>that they could not be counted or numbered</b><br>The hyperbolic expression of the number of sacrifices underscores the abundance of Israel's worship and the overwhelming nature of their offerings. It reflects the people's generosity and the importance of the event. This abundance can be seen as a type of the limitless grace and mercy of God, as well as the infinite value of Christ's sacrifice for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom and for building the temple in Jerusalem.

The ark of the covenant was the earthly throne of God, where He promised, &#8220;I will meet with you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/25-21.htm">Exodus 25:21-22</a>). Its placement in the Most Holy Place signified the very presence of the LORD among His people (<a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>). By gathering &#8220;before the ark,&#8221; Solomon and Israel positioned themselves consciously before the face of God, acknowledging His real, covenantal presence. Just as Joshua had carried the ark into the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13-17</a>) and David had danced before it (<a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14-15</a>), the nation now assembles to celebrate the fulfillment of God&#8217;s promise that His Name would dwell in this house (<a href="/1_kings/8-13.htm">1 Kings 8:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>King Solomon and the whole congregation of Israel</b><p>&#8226; Leadership and laity stand together: &#8220;King Solomon and the whole congregation of Israel.&#8221; The king does not worship alone; covenant faith always draws the community (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-8</a>). Solomon&#8217;s personal devotion echoes his earlier thousand-offering night at Gibeon (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>) but now expands to include everyone, fulfilling Deuteronomy&#8217;s call for national feasts (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>). The scene mirrors Moses and all Israel reading the Law at Shechem (<a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30-35</a>) and foreshadows Ezra leading the people in renewal (<a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-8</a>).

This assembly is not casual; it is covenantal, ordered, and joyous, reminiscent of the great convocation at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>) and anticipating the greater assembly in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-10</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sacrificed so many sheep and oxen</b><p>&#8226; Worship is costly and concrete.

Their blood signified atonement (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>), their aroma a pleasing offering to God (<a href="/numbers/28-2.htm">Numbers 28:2</a>). The scale recalls David&#8217;s sacrifice when the plague halted (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24-25</a>) and Solomon&#8217;s earlier generosity (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>). Such lavish giving underscores God&#8217;s worth and foreshadows the perfect once-for-all sacrifice of Christ, &#8220;the Lamb of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that they could not be counted or numbered</b><p>&#8226; The overwhelming number highlights God&#8217;s abundant blessing.

It shows Israel&#8217;s gratitude for a completed temple and a secure kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20-25</a>). Counting was impossible, indicating that worship spilled beyond human measurement&#8212;an echo of <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>, God&#8217;s ability to do &#8220;exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Before the ark, Solomon and all Israel consciously entered God&#8217;s presence, uniting leader and people in covenant worship.
