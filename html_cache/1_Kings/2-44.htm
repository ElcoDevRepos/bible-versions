Solomon, as the newly established king, is consolidating his rule and addressing unfinished business from his father David's reign. This reflects the transition of power and the need for Solomon to establish his authority and ensure justice in his kingdom.<p><b>You know in your heart</b><br>This phrase suggests an appeal to Shimei's conscience. It implies that Shimei is fully aware of his past actions and their moral implications. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of moral and spiritual life, indicating that Shimei's guilt is not just external but internal and self-evident.<p><b>all the evil that you did to my father David</b><br>Shimei had cursed David during Absalom's rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-13</a>). This act of cursing the Lord's anointed was considered a grave sin. David had initially spared Shimei, showing mercy, but Solomon now holds him accountable. This highlights the biblical principle of justice and the consequences of sin, as well as the importance of respecting God's chosen leaders.<p><b>Therefore the LORD will bring your evil back upon your head</b><br>This statement underscores the biblical theme of divine justice and retribution. It reflects the belief that God is ultimately in control and will ensure that justice is served. The phrase "upon your head" is a common biblical expression indicating personal responsibility and the inevitability of facing the consequences of one's actions. This also connects to the broader biblical narrative where God often uses human agents to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the lives of the prophets and kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the king of Israel at this time.
