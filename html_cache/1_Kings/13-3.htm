In the context of <a href="/1_kings/13.htm">1 Kings 13</a>, this prophet comes from Judah to Bethel to confront King Jeroboam. The giving of a sign is a common biblical method to authenticate a prophet's message (e.g., <a href="/exodus/4.htm">Exodus 4:1-9</a>). Signs serve as divine confirmation, often accompanying a prophetic word to demonstrate God's power and authority.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD has spoken this sign:</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the message. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) indicates the covenant name of God, underscoring His authority and the seriousness of the message. This declaration asserts that the sign is not of human origin but a direct communication from God, reinforcing the prophet's role as a mouthpiece for divine will.<p><b>&#8216;Surely the altar will be split apart,</b><br>The altar in question is the one Jeroboam erected at Bethel, part of his attempt to establish a rival worship center to Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>). The splitting of the altar symbolizes God's judgment against idolatry and false worship. This act serves as a physical manifestation of divine disapproval, reminiscent of other biblical instances where God demonstrates His power over false religious practices (e.g., <a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19-20</a>).<p><b>and the ashes upon it will be poured out.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Ashes on the altar represent the remnants of sacrifices, and their pouring out signifies the rejection of those offerings. This act symbolizes the nullification of Jeroboam's religious practices and the futility of worship that deviates from God's commandments. The imagery of ashes being poured out can also be seen as a sign of mourning and repentance, as in other biblical contexts (e.g., <a href="/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>).

The sign, announced to secure credence to the prediction, is itself a visible type of what that prediction foretold, in the shattering of the altar and the scattering of the ashes of the burnt-offering. The sign actually given includes, besides this, the sudden withering of the king's hand, stretched out in defiance of the prophet--an equally plain symbol of the miserable failure of his strength and policy, when opposed to the Law and the judgment of God. It should be noted that the withdrawal of this last sign of wrath, on the submission of the king and the prayer of the prophet, was apparently designed to give Jeroboam one more opportunity of repentance. The last verses of the chapter (<a href="/context/1_kings/13-33.htm" title="After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.">1Kings 13:33-34</a>) seem to imply that, but for the interposition of the old prophet of Bethel, he might still have taken that opportunity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he gave a sign</span> [The Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> rather signifies a <span class="accented">portent</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">miraculum, prodigium</span>) than a <span class="accented">sign</span>, the proper word for which is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>.

The fitness of this particular sign is obvious] <span class="cmt_word">the same day, saying, This is the sign which</span> [Rather <span class="accented">that</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5b0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;</span>. The A.V. rendering hardly makes sense. Nor does it agree, as Rawlinson seems to think, with the LXX., which reads <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.] <span class="cmt_word">the Lord hath spoken</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by me. "This is the proof that my message is from Him, and is no idle threat." Wordsworth sees in this sign "a proof vouchsafed by God Himself to the man of Judah, as well as to Jeroboam, that he was really sent by God," etc. But surely a man who came "in the word of the Lord," and cried, "Thus saith the Lord," wanted no proof that "he was doing God's bidding" (see <a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>)]; <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the altar shall be rent and the ashes</span> [strictly, <span class="accented">fat ashes</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>; properly, "fatness" (see <a href="/judges/9-9.htm">Judges 9:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.), is the fat of the sacrifice, which was burnt upon the altar, mixed with the ashes that consumed it] <span class="cmt_word">that are upon it shall be poured out.</span> [The sign, a partial destruction of the altar, and the scattering of the sacrifice, was admirably calculated to presage its ultimate and final and ignominious overthrow. The idea favoured by Stanley ("Jewish Ch." 2:280) that this prediction was fulfilled "if not before, at least" in the time of Amos, when the altar was destroyed by an earthquake shock (<a href="/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1</a>; cf. 3:14), does not seem to take account of ver. 5.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/13-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">That</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(bay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the man of God] gave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1503;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a sign,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1508;&#1461;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#183;p&#772;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4159.htm">Strong's 4159: </a> </span><span class="str2">A miracle, a token, omen</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saying,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1502;&#1465;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#183;m&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2088.htm">Strong's 2088: </a> </span><span class="str2">This, that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is the sign</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1508;&#1461;&#1428;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;p&#772;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4159.htm">Strong's 4159: </a> </span><span class="str2">A miracle, a token, omen</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has spoken:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(dib&#183;ber)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
