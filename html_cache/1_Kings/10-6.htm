Her visit underscores the widespread fame of Solomon's wisdom and the prosperity of his kingdom. The interaction between the Queen of Sheba and Solomon highlights the international recognition of Israel during Solomon's reign, fulfilling the promise of Israel being a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>).<p><b>The report I heard in my own country</b><br>The Queen of Sheba's acknowledgment of the reports she heard emphasizes the far-reaching reputation of Solomon's wisdom and the grandeur of his kingdom. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Solomon in <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>, where God grants him unparalleled wisdom. The mention of her own country, likely the region of modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia, indicates the extensive trade networks and communication of the ancient world.<p><b>About your words and wisdom</b><br>Solomon's wisdom was a divine gift, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5-14</a>, where God grants him wisdom in response to his humble request. His wisdom was not only intellectual but also practical, as demonstrated in his judicial decisions, proverbs, and songs (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>). This wisdom is a type of Christ, who is described as the wisdom of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>).<p><b>Is true</b><br>The Queen of Sheba's confirmation of the reports she heard serves as a testament to the authenticity and divine source of Solomon's wisdom. Her acknowledgment can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to make Solomon's wisdom known throughout the earth. This also prefigures the recognition of Jesus Christ's wisdom and authority by those who encounter Him, as seen in the Gospels (<a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/q/queen_of_sheba.htm">Queen of Sheba</a></b><br>A monarch from the region of Sheba, likely located in modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia.

They breathe at once the spirit of Oriental compliment, and a certain seriousness of tone, as of a mind stirred by unusual wonder and admiration. It is worth notice that they touch but lightly on external magnificence and prosperity, and go on to dwell emphatically on the wisdom of Solomon, as a wisdom enabling him to do judgment and justice, and as a gift from Jehovah, his God. The acknowledgment of Jehovah, of course, does not imply acceptance of the religion of Israel. It expresses the belief that He, as the tutelary God of Israel, is to be held in reverence, proportionate to the extraordinary glory which He has given to His nation.
