Asa was the third king of the southern kingdom of Judah, following his father Abijah. Asa's reign is noted for religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11-15</a>. The mention of Asa's reign provides a timeline for Nadab's rule in the northern kingdom of Israel, highlighting the divided monarchy period after Solomon's reign.<p><b>Nadab son of Jeroboam</b><br>Nadab was the son of Jeroboam I, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy. Jeroboam's reign was marked by the establishment of alternative worship centers in Bethel and Dan to prevent Israelites from going to Jerusalem, which led to idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-33</a>). Nadab's lineage is significant as it continues the dynasty of Jeroboam, which was prophesied to be cut off due to Jeroboam's sins (<a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10-11</a>).<p><b>became king of Israel</b><br>Nadab's ascension to the throne signifies the continuation of Jeroboam's dynasty, albeit briefly. The northern kingdom of Israel was often characterized by political instability and idolatry, contrasting with the Davidic line in Judah. Nadab's reign is part of the broader narrative of Israel's kings, many of whom "did evil in the sight of the LORD," leading to eventual judgment and exile.<p><b>and he reigned two years</b><br>Nadab's short reign of two years suggests a period of instability and foreshadows his violent end. His brief rule is indicative of the turbulent nature of Israel's monarchy, where assassinations and coups were common. Nadab's assassination by Baasha, as recorded in <a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27-28</a>, fulfills the prophecy against Jeroboam's house and demonstrates the consequences of departing from God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nadab.htm">Nadab</a></b><br>The son of Jeroboam, who became king of Israel.

See <a href="/1_kings/15-9.htm">1 Kings 15:9&#8211;10</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/14-1.htm">2 Chronicles 14:1&#8211;2</a>, where Asa is introduced as a king who &#8220;did what was good and right in the sight of the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By noting Asa&#8217;s early years, Scripture lets us compare the moral climate in Judah with that in Israel. While Asa was initiating reforms (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-8.htm">2 Chronicles 15:8</a>), Israel was sinking deeper into sin. This contrast highlights <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>&#8217;s promise of blessing for obedience and curse for rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel</b><p>&#8226; Nadab&#8217;s rise fulfills the political dynasty Jeroboam had established in <a href="/1_kings/12-20.htm">1 Kings 12:20</a>. Yet it also reminds us of God&#8217;s earlier warning: because Jeroboam led Israel into idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/14-9.htm">1 Kings 14:9</a>), his house would be cut off (<a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; When Scripture repeats &#8220;son of Jeroboam,&#8221; it underlines a legacy. Nadab inherited not only the throne but the sins of his father. Compare <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, where the consequences of sin extend &#8220;to the third and fourth generation.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse presents no surprise coups or hidden agendas&#8212;God&#8217;s Word plainly states who rules and when, demonstrating His sovereign oversight (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he reigned two years</b><p>&#8226; A two-year reign is strikingly brief compared to David&#8217;s forty years (<a href="/1_kings/2-11.htm">1 Kings 2:11</a>) or Solomon&#8217;s forty (<a href="/1_kings/11-42.htm">1 Kings 11:42</a>). Short reigns often signal divine judgment. Indeed, <a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27&#8211;28</a> records Baasha&#8217;s assassination of Nadab, fulfilling the prophecy against Jeroboam&#8217;s house.<p>&#8226; The pattern recurs later: Elah&#8217;s two-year reign ends violently (<a href="/1_kings/16-8.htm">1 Kings 16:8&#8211;10</a>). Such brevity illustrates <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, &#8220;Do not be deceived: God is not mocked.&#8221; Judgment may be delayed but never denied.<p>&#8226; Yet even in judgment, God keeps His promises. The rapid turnover paves the way for prophetic voices like Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>), showing God&#8217;s relentless pursuit of His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/15-25.htm">1 Kings 15:25</a> is a concise time-stamp with rich theological weight. It contrasts Judah&#8217;s reforming Asa with Israel&#8217;s idolatrous line, underscores the inherited consequences of Jeroboam&#8217;s sin, and demonstrates God&#8217;s faithfulness to judge swiftly when warnings are ignored. The verse invites us to trust God&#8217;s precise control of history and to walk in obedience, knowing that righteousness exalts a nation while sin remains a reproach to any people (<a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Nadab</span> [ = <span class="accented">liberal</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the son of Jeroboam began to reign</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">reigned</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah and reigned over Israel two years.</span> [The reigns of these five kings of Israel are related with great brevity.
