Ramoth-gilead was a significant city east of the Jordan River, known for its strategic military importance. It was a city of refuge, as mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-43.htm">Deuteronomy 4:43</a>, and played a role in various military campaigns, including those involving King Ahab and King Jehoshaphat (1 Kings 22).

This description aligns with the biblical portrayal of Bashan as a land of strong cities (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4-5</a>).

(They can hardly be one and the same person, though they are often identified, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in the Speaker's Comm. on <a href="/judges/10-3.htm">Judges 10:3</a>.
