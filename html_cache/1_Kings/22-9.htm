Ahab is often remembered for his idolatry and his marriage to Jezebel, which led Israel further into the worship of Baal. The officials in the king's court were likely high-ranking members of his administration, possibly military leaders or advisors. This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Near Eastern monarchies, where the king had a close circle of trusted officials to carry out his commands.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.&#8221;</b><br>Micaiah is a prophet of the Lord, distinct from the 400 prophets who were advising Ahab. His name means "Who is like Yahweh?" which underscores his role as a true prophet of God. Micaiah's father, Imlah, is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, suggesting that Micaiah may not have come from a prominent family, highlighting that God often chooses unlikely individuals to deliver His messages. The urgency in Ahab's command to bring Micaiah "at once" suggests a pressing need for divine insight, despite Ahab's reluctance to hear Micaiah's prophecies, which were often unfavorable to him. This moment foreshadows the tension between true prophecy and the king's desires, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. Micaiah's role as a prophet can be seen as a type of Christ, who also spoke truth to power and was often rejected by those in authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel</a></b><br>At this time, the king of Israel is Ahab, known for his idolatry and opposition to the prophets of the Lord.

The narrative centers on Ahab, whose history shows habitual resistance to God&#8217;s word (<a href="/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a>; 22:8).<p>&#8226; Though he often disregards prophetic counsel, he still acknowledges the need for it, echoing earlier episodes where kings reluctantly sought divine input (<a href="/2_kings/1-3.htm">2 Kings 1:3</a>; <a href="/jonah/1-6.htm">Jonah 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/2_chronicles/18-7.htm">2 Chronicles 18:7</a> (parallel account) he admits hating Micaiah &#8220;because he never prophesies good concerning me,&#8221; underscoring the tension between earthly power and prophetic truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>called one of his officials</b><p>&#8226; Ahab exercises royal authority, summoning a court officer just as Pharaoh, Xerxes, and other rulers did (<a href="/genesis/41-10.htm">Genesis 41:10</a>; <a href="/esther/1-10.htm">Esther 1:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The official&#8217;s obedience highlights the structured hierarchy surrounding Israel&#8217;s monarch, contrasting with the ultimate authority of the Lord over kings (<a href="/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in a corrupt court, God can position faithful messengers&#8212;reminiscent of Obadiah in Ahab&#8217;s palace (<a href="/1_kings/18-3.htm">1 Kings 18:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said</b><p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s spoken command reminds us that, in Scripture, words carry decisive weight: creation itself began with &#8220;God said&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Ahab&#8217;s order shows human speech directing events, yet it will soon be countered by divine speech through Micaiah (<a href="/1_kings/22-14.htm">1 Kings 22:14, 19</a>).<p>&#8226; This sets up a collision between royal decree and prophetic declaration&#8212;echoed later when Herod issues orders against John the Baptist (<a href="/mark/6-17.htm">Mark 6:17&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bring Micaiah son of Imlah</b><p>&#8226; Micaiah, though little mentioned elsewhere, stands in the line of fearless prophets such as Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>) and Nathan (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; His lineage (&#8220;son of Imlah&#8221;) stresses personal integrity over pedigree; like Amos the shepherd (<a href="/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>), God calls ordinary people to speak extraordinary truth.<p>&#8226; Ahab&#8217;s summons fulfills God&#8217;s plan to confront the king&#8217;s sin, paralleling how King Jehoshaphat sought genuine prophecy earlier in the chapter (<a href="/1_kings/22-7.htm">1 Kings 22:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at once</b><p>&#8226; Urgency grips the scene; yet while the king presses for speed, God&#8217;s timing governs the outcome (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase mirrors other immediate calls to obedience&#8212;Abraham rising early to follow God&#8217;s command (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) and the disciples leaving nets &#8220;at once&#8221; to follow Jesus (<a href="/mark/1-18.htm">Mark 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; It foreshadows the swiftness of impending judgment on Ahab, fulfilled before the chapter ends (<a href="/1_kings/22-37.htm">1 Kings 22:37&#8211;38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Ahab&#8217;s brief command in <a href="/1_kings/22-9.htm">1 Kings 22:9</a> reveals more than royal protocol. It showcases a king trapped between political maneuvering and the inexorable word of the Lord. By ordering Micaiah&#8217;s presence, Ahab inadvertently invites divine truth into his war council. The scene underscores God&#8217;s control over earthly authorities, the necessity of genuine prophetic voice, and the urgency of responding to God&#8217;s word without delay.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king of Israel caned an officer</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">one</span> <span class="accented">eunuch</span>.
