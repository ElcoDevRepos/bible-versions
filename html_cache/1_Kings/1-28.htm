His reign established Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel. This moment occurs during a time of political tension, as Adonijah, David's son, has declared himself king without David's approval. David's decision-making here is crucial for the future of the Davidic line, which is significant in biblical prophecy concerning the Messiah (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Call in Bathsheba for me.&#8221;</b><br>Bathsheba, the wife of David and mother of Solomon, plays a pivotal role in the succession narrative. Her relationship with David began controversially (2 Samuel 11), but she is now a key figure in ensuring Solomon's rightful place as king. This request signifies David's recognition of Bathsheba's influence and the importance of securing Solomon's succession, aligning with God's promise that Solomon would succeed David (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>).<p><b>So she came into the king&#8217;s presence</b><br>Bathsheba's entrance into the king's presence indicates her respected status and the urgency of the situation. In the ancient Near Eastern context, approaching a king required permission, highlighting the gravity of her role. Her presence before David underscores the personal and political dynamics at play, as she advocates for her son's future.<p><b>and stood before him.</b><br>Standing before the king signifies respect and readiness to engage in important dialogue. This posture reflects Bathsheba's position as both a subject and a mother advocating for her son. It also sets the stage for David's subsequent actions to affirm Solomon's kingship, fulfilling God's covenantal promise and ensuring the continuation of the Davidic line, which is foundational to the messianic hope found in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God, his military conquests, and his complex personal life.
