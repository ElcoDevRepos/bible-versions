His reign as king of Judah is characterized by a continuation of the sinful practices initiated by his father, Rehoboam. These sins likely included idolatry and the worship of foreign gods, which were prevalent in Judah during this period. The phrase indicates a generational pattern of disobedience to God's commandments, highlighting the influence of parental example on a child's spiritual path. This pattern of sin is reminiscent of the warnings given in the Mosaic Law about the consequences of idolatry and disobedience (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>).<p><b>and his heart was not as fully devoted to the LORD his God</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. Abijam's heart is described as not fully devoted, suggesting a lack of complete commitment and sincerity in his relationship with God. This partial devotion contrasts with the wholeheartedness that God desires from His followers, as seen in the Shema, a central declaration of faith in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which calls for loving God with all one's heart, soul, and strength.<p><b>as the heart of David his forefather had been</b><br>David, the forefather of Abijam, is often held as the standard for kingship in Israel due to his deep devotion and repentance before God, despite his own failings. David's heart is described as being "after God's own heart" (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>), indicating a sincere and earnest pursuit of God's will. This comparison underscores the expectation for the kings of Judah to emulate David's faithfulness and integrity. David's legacy serves as a benchmark for evaluating the spiritual and moral conduct of his descendants, emphasizing the importance of a genuine relationship with God over mere ritualistic observance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijam.htm">Abijam</a></b><br>Also known as Abijah, he was the king of Judah and the son of Rehoboam.

That little word &#8220;all&#8221; allows no exceptions.<p>&#8226; Rehoboam&#8217;s reign had been marked by idolatry, moral corruption, and political compromise (<a href="/1_kings/14-22.htm">1 Kings 14:22-24</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-1.htm">2 Chronicles 12:1</a>). Abijam chose the same path.<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/2_chronicles/13.htm">2 Chronicles 13</a> details a single moment when Abijam invoked the covenant name of the LORD in battle, but even that victory did not translate into lasting obedience.<p>&#8226; The verse underscores personal responsibility: generational examples influence us, yet every king&#8212;and every believer&#8212;answers personally to God (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern illustrates the warning of <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a> that sin&#8217;s effects spread through families when left unchecked.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his heart was not as fully devoted to the LORD his God</b><p>Scripture weighs kings not merely by policies but by the heart&#8217;s posture toward God.

The verse warns against excusing sin because of family patterns, reminds us that God measures by heart-level allegiance, and calls us to the same unwavering devotion that characterized David&#8212;a devotion made possible today through the indwelling Spirit and the finished work of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Walked in all the sins of his father.</span>--This adoption of the idolatries of Rehoboam did not prevent Abijam (see <a href="/context/2_chronicles/13-4.htm" title="And Abijah stood up on mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, you Jeroboam, and all Israel;">2Chronicles 13:4-12</a>) from representing himself as the champion of the Temple and the priesthood against the rival worship of Jeroboam, and dedicating treasures--perhaps the spoils of his victory--in the house of the Lord. From the qualified phrase "his heart was not perfect before God," however, it may be inferred that, like Solomon and Rehoboam, he professed to worship Jehovah only as the supreme God of his Pantheon; and it is a curious irony of circumstance that he should be recorded as inveighing against the degradation of His worship in Israel, while he himself countenanced or connived at the worse sin of the worship of rival gods in Judah.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him</span> [sins, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the theocratic standpoint.
