Leaving the oxen symbolizes a significant life change, abandoning his former life to follow God's call. This act of leaving behind one's livelihood is reminiscent of the disciples leaving their nets to follow Jesus (<a href="/matthew/4-20.htm">Matthew 4:20</a>).<p><b>ran after Elijah</b><br>Elisha's immediate response to Elijah's call demonstrates his eagerness and commitment. Running signifies urgency and willingness to embrace God's mission. This mirrors the urgency seen in other biblical figures who respond to God's call, such as Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8220;Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye,</b><br>Elisha's request to bid farewell to his parents shows respect for family ties, a significant cultural value in ancient Israel. This act is similar to the request made by a potential disciple in <a href="/luke/9-61.htm">Luke 9:61</a>, highlighting the tension between familial obligations and divine calling.<p><b>and then I will follow you.&#8221;</b><br>Elisha's intention to follow Elijah indicates his acceptance of the prophetic call. This mirrors the call to discipleship in the New Testament, where following Christ requires leaving behind former ways (<a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26-27</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Go on back,&#8221; Elijah replied,</b><br>Elijah's response suggests a test of Elisha's commitment. By allowing Elisha to return, Elijah respects his decision, emphasizing the voluntary nature of following God's call. This reflects the principle of free will in responding to God's invitation.<p><b>&#8220;for what have I done to you?&#8221;</b><br>Elijah's rhetorical question implies that the call is ultimately from God, not Elijah himself. It underscores the divine origin of the prophetic mission.

The comparison suggests that the answer of Elijah is one of half-ironical rebuke of what seemed hesitation--"Go back, if thou wilt; what have I done to constrain thee?" In both cases we have the stern but necessary rejection of half-hearted service, even if the heart be distracted by the most natural and sacred love. But Elijah sees that Elisha means simply farewell, and he apparently waits till it is over.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he left the oxen</span> [As, being the last in the line, he could do, without stopping the others.

Indeed, it would have been strange if there had been. A greater readiness to obey the prophetic summons, Elisha could not well have showed. Forthwith, as soon as he realized his call, "he left the oxen and ran after" his newmaster. True, he asks permission - and why should he not? for "grace is no enemy to good nature" - to give a parting embrace to the father and mother to whom he owed his life, and whom he had been required by God to honour. But there is no proof of "a divided heart" here. If he had begged to be allowed to stay and <span class="accented">bury</span> his mother and father (St. <a href="/luke/9-59.htm">Luke 9:59-61</a>) it might have been otherwise. But he suggests nothing of the kind. He says: "One kiss, one farewell, and then I will follow thee." It is a complete mistake, consequently, to interpret Elijah's words to mean, "Go, return to thy ploughing, for why shouldst thou quit it?... Thou canst remain as thou art" (Rawlinson). Their true meaning, as evidenced by the sequel (ver. 21), clearly was, "Go back and kiss them; why shouldst thou not? <span class="accented">For</span> what have I done to thee? I have summoned thee to follow me. But I have not required thee to repudiate thine own flesh and blood."] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/19-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Elisha left</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1465;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;z&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
