In ancient Israel, swearing by the LORD was a binding commitment, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and His people. This act underscores Solomon's role as a king who acknowledges divine authority. The use of an oath also connects to other biblical instances where leaders swore by God to affirm truth or intent, such as in <a href="/genesis/21-23.htm">Genesis 21:23-24</a> with Abraham and Abimelech.<p><b>May God punish me, and ever so severely:</b><br>This phrase is a form of self-imprecation, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where individuals would invoke divine retribution upon themselves if they failed to fulfill their oath. It reflects the gravity of the situation and Solomon's commitment to justice. The language echoes similar expressions found in <a href="/ruth/1-17.htm">Ruth 1:17</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>, where individuals call upon God to hold them accountable.<p><b>if Adonijah has not made this request at the expense of his life:</b><br>Adonijah's request, interpreted as a political maneuver to claim the throne, is seen as a direct threat to Solomon's God-ordained kingship. In the context of ancient monarchies, any challenge to the throne was often met with severe consequences to maintain stability and divine order. This phrase highlights the tension between Solomon and Adonijah, rooted in the earlier narrative of <a href="/1_kings/1.htm">1 Kings 1</a>, where Adonijah attempted to usurp the throne. Solomon's response is a fulfillment of his duty to protect his reign and the Davidic line, which holds messianic significance as it foreshadows the eternal kingship of Jesus Christ, a descendant of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.
