His place was clearly with his army at Gibbethon (ver. 15; cf. <a href="/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a>. 4). And as clearly it was not in the house of one of his subjects, even the intendant of his palace. "An Oriental monarch... is precluded by etiquette from accepting the hospitality of his subjects" - Rawlinson, who further remarks that the low tastes which we here find Elah indulging" had probably been formed before his father was exalted <span class="accented">out of the dust</span>." As probably they were inherited direct from his father. Anyhow, they led to his destruction. It is clear that Elah's want of character, like Nadab's, suggested the conspiracy of Zimri.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/16-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">However, while Elah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
