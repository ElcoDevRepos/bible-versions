David refers to Joab, his former military commander, who had committed acts of violence and treachery. The phrase underscores the biblical principle of justice and accountability, reflecting the Old Testament law where wrongdoing must be addressed (<a href="/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12-14</a>). It highlights the importance of discernment in leadership, a theme prevalent throughout the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs.<p><b>for you are a wise man</b><br>David acknowledges Solomon's wisdom, which is a central theme in Solomon's reign. This wisdom is later confirmed when Solomon famously asks God for wisdom to govern the people (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>). The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative where wisdom is a divine gift, as seen in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, and is essential for righteous leadership.<p><b>You know what you ought to do to him</b><br>David entrusts Solomon with the responsibility of executing justice, implying that Solomon's wisdom will guide him in making the right decision. This reflects the biblical theme of divine guidance in leadership, as seen in the lives of other leaders like Moses and Joshua. It also foreshadows Solomon's role as a judge and king who must balance justice and mercy.<p><b>to bring his gray head down to Sheol in blood</b><br>This phrase indicates the severity of Joab's crimes and the necessity of his execution as a form of justice. "Gray head" symbolizes old age, suggesting that Joab's time for judgment has come. "Sheol" refers to the abode of the dead in Hebrew thought, emphasizing the finality of the judgment. The concept of blood guilt and retribution is consistent with the covenantal laws found in the Torah, such as <a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>, which stress the need for justice to maintain the land's purity. This also prefigures the ultimate justice and redemption found in Christ, who fulfills the law and offers forgiveness through His blood.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The aging king of Israel who is giving final instructions to his son Solomon.

Scripture&#8217;s broader testimony affirms that mercy may delay but never cancels deserved judgment, and wise, lawful rulers are God&#8217;s means of maintaining that balance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore</span> [lit., "<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">now."</span> Possibly the "now" is a note of time in apposition to the "day" of ver. 8, or rather the time of David's oath. "I then unadvisedly swam unto him, but now the law must have its course." Probably it is merely inferential, - <span class="accented">quae cum ita sint</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>hold him not guiltless</span> [rather, <span class="accented">thou shalt not leave him unpunished</span> (Vatablus, Gesen., Bahr, <span class="accented">al.</span>); cf. <a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>]; <span class="cmt_word">for thou art a wise man</span> [<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.)

The age of Joab and Shimei would make the Divine Nemesis the more conspicuous. Men would "see that there was a God that judgeth in the earth"] <span class="cmt_word">bring thou down to the grave with blood.</span> The Auth. Version here needlessly alters the <span class="accented">order</span> of the original, which should be followed wherever it can be (and it generally can) without sacrifice of idiom and elegance. In this case the alteration, by the slight prominence it gives to "hoar head" and to "blood," gives a factitious harshness to the sentence. The Hebrew stands thus: "And thou shalt bring down his hoar head with blood to Sheol." This order of the words also exhibits somewhat more clearly the sequence of thought, which is this: "Thou art wise, therefore thou knowest what by law thou shouldest do. What thou shalt do is, thou shalt bring down," etc. It is clear from these words that if David was actuated by malice, by a "passionate desire to punish those who had wronged him" (Plumptre, Dict. Bib., art. "Solomon"), or by "fierce and profound vindictiveness" (Stanley, "Jewish Church," vol. 2. p. 135), he was profoundly unconscious of it. If it was "a dark legacy of hate" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>) he was bequeathing to Solomon, then he stands before us in these last hours either as an unctuous hypocrite, or as infatuated and inconsistent to the last degree. That the man who, in his opening words (ver. 3), enjoined upon his son, in the most emphatic manner, a strict and literal obedience to the law of Heaven, should in these subsequent words, delivered almost in the same breath, require him to satiate a long-cherished and cruel revenge upon Joab and Shimei (the latter of whom he had twice delivered from death), is an instance of self contradiction which is almost, if not quite, without parallel. But as I have showed elsewhere, at some length, it is a superficial and entirely erroneous view of David's last words, which supposes them to have been inspired by malice or cruelty. His absorbing idea was clearly this, that he had not "kept the charge of the Lord;" that he, the chief magistrate, the "revenger to execute wrath," by sparing Joab and Shimei, the murderer and the blasphemer, both of whose lives were forfeited to justice, had failed in his duty, had weakened the sanctions of law, and compromised the honour of the Most High. He is too old and too weak to execute the sentence of the law now, but for the safety of his people, for the security of his throne, it must be done, and therefore Solomon, who was under no obligation to spare the criminals his father had spared, must be required to do it. Of the Jewish king it might be said with a special propriety, <span class="accented">"Rex est lex loquens,"</span> and seldom has the voice of law spoken with greater dignity and fidelity than by David in this dying charge. To say, as Harwood does, (Lange, American Trans., p. 32) that "nothing but sophistry can justify his [David's] charge to Solomon, not to let the unfortunate man [Shimei] die in peace," merely shows how imperfectly the writer has entered into the spirit of the theocratic law, that law under which David lived, and by which alone he could be governed and govern others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/2-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
