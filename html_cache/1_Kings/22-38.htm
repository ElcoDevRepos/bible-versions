The pool of Samaria was likely a public place used for various purposes, including washing. Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, established by King Omri, Ahab's father. The washing of the chariot signifies the removal of blood and impurities, a common practice in ancient times to cleanse items used in battle. This act also symbolizes the attempt to erase the memory of Ahab's defeat and death.<p><b>where the prostitutes bathed</b><br>This detail highlights the moral and spiritual decay present in Israel at the time. The presence of prostitutes, likely cultic, indicates the syncretism and idolatry that had infiltrated Israelite society, often associated with the worship of Baal and Asherah. This setting underscores the contrast between the intended holiness of Israel and its current state of moral compromise.<p><b>and the dogs licked up Ahab&#8217;s blood</b><br>The imagery of dogs licking blood is a vivid representation of disgrace and divine judgment. In ancient Near Eastern culture, dogs were considered unclean animals, and their presence here signifies the ultimate humiliation and defilement of Ahab, a king who led Israel into idolatry. This act fulfills the prophecy given by Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>, where God declared that dogs would lick Ahab's blood as a consequence of his sins, particularly his role in Naboth's unjust death.<p><b>according to the word that the LORD had spoken</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the fulfillment of divine prophecy, highlighting God's sovereignty and the certainty of His word. The prophecy concerning Ahab's demise was a direct message from God through the prophet Elijah, demonstrating that God's judgments are inevitable and just. This serves as a reminder of the reliability of God's promises and warnings throughout Scripture, reinforcing the theme that God holds rulers accountable for their actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel whose death is described in this verse.

Servants naturally &#8220;washed the chariot&#8221; when it returned to Samaria.<p>&#8211; Scripture records this mundane act to show how the king&#8217;s blood was handled, tying the detail directly to an earlier prophecy (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>).<p>&#8211; Cross reference: in <a href="/2_chronicles/18-34.htm">2 Chronicles 18:34</a>, parallel history confirms Ahab died at evening and was brought back, underscoring the same sequence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At the pool of Samaria</b><p>&#8211; The washing happened &#8220;at the pool of Samaria,&#8221; a public reservoir just outside the capital&#8217;s gate.<p>&#8211; Because city pools were community gathering spots (cf. <a href="/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3</a>; <a href="/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>), the scene would be witnessed by common people, making the fulfillment of God&#8217;s word public rather than hidden behind palace walls.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Where the prostitutes bathed</b><p>&#8211; The note that &#8220;prostitutes bathed&#8221; there heightens the humiliation. Ahab, who had built temples for Baal and promoted idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30&#8211;33</a>), is posthumously associated with a place used by cult prostitutes (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/23-17.htm">Deuteronomy 23:17&#8211;18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>).<p>&#8211; The contrast is stark: the king who exalted himself dies, and his blood is washed away in the very place identified with moral uncleanness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The dogs licked up Ahab&#8217;s blood</b><p>&#8211; Street dogs scavenged in ancient cities (<a href="/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-14.htm">Psalm 59:14&#8211;15</a>). As the bloody water flowed off, &#8220;the dogs licked up&#8221; the diluted blood.<p>&#8211; This exactly fits Elijah&#8217;s earlier warning: &#8220;In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will lick up your blood&#8212;yes, yours!&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>).<p>&#8211; What happened to Naboth outside Jezreel now happens to Ahab in Samaria; poetic justice is served.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>According to the word that the LORD had spoken</b><p>&#8211; The narrator explicitly anchors the event in divine prophecy (<a href="/1_kings/21-17.htm">1 Kings 21:17&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s word never fails (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10&#8211;11</a>); the verse underlines His authority over kings and nations (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8211; Every component&#8212;the place, the dogs, the public shame&#8212;was foretold, reminding readers that human power cannot overturn God&#8217;s decree.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/22-38.htm">1 Kings 22:38</a> is a vivid, literal fulfillment of Elijah&#8217;s prophecy against Ahab.

The dog and the harlot are the animal and human types of uncleanness.<p><span class= "bld">According unto the word of the Lord.</span>--The reference to the emphatic prophecy of Elijah is unmistakable, and the context fixes its fulfilment plainly as having taken place in Samaria. The difficulty is, of course, the notice in <a href="/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;">2Kings 9:25</a>, where the dead body of Jehoram is cast "in the portion of the field of Naboth," evidently at Jezreel; with quotation of the "burden of the Lord laid upon him," "I will requite thee in this plot, saith the Lord." The reconcilement is, with our knowledge, difficult, if not impossible. But the reference in the text is so much clearer, that it must outweigh the other. Naboth, in any case, is likely to have had land in his native place, which would be forfeited to the king; and there would still be an appropriate judgment in making it also the scene of the dishonoured death of the last king of Ahab's house. We may notice, moreover, that the quotation in 2 Kings 9 is not taken from Elijah's words against Ahab, nor does it contain the characteristic notice of the "dogs licking the blood;" though it is noticed as a fulfilment of the subsequent prophecy of chapter 21:24 against Ahab's house.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And one washed the chariot in</span> [<span class="accented">or at</span>; <span class="accented">Heb</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the pool of Samaria.</span> [Nearly all Eastern cities had their tanks or pools, often outside the city gate.
