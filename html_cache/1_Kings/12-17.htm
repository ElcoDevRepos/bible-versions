His reign marks a significant turning point in Israel's history, as it led to the division of the united kingdom. Despite the rebellion of the northern tribes, Rehoboam retained control over the southern kingdom. This phrase highlights the continuation of the Davidic line, which is significant in biblical prophecy concerning the Messiah, who is foretold to come from David's lineage (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>over the Israelites</b><br>The term "Israelites" here refers specifically to the people of the southern kingdom, Judah, who remained under Rehoboam's rule. This distinction is crucial as it sets the stage for the divided monarchy: Israel in the north and Judah in the south. The division fulfilled the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>), indicating God's sovereign plan despite human actions.<p><b>living in the cities of Judah</b><br>Judah, the southern kingdom, included the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The cities of Judah were significant centers of worship and governance, with Jerusalem as the capital. This region held the temple, the central place of worship for the Israelites, which maintained its religious significance even after the kingdom's division. The phrase underscores the geographical and political boundaries that defined Rehoboam's reign and the continuity of worship practices centered in Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Judah.

(<span class= "ital">b</span>) But, besides this, there may be a significance in the phrase "children of Israel."
