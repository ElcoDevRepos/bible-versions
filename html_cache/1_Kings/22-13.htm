In the context of ancient Israel, messengers often played crucial roles in communication between kings and prophets. Micaiah was known for his commitment to speaking God's truth, regardless of the consequences. This sets the stage for the tension between divine truth and human authority. The role of a messenger was significant, as they were expected to convey the exact words and intentions of their sender, highlighting the importance of fidelity to one's mission.<p><b>Behold now, with one accord the words of the prophets are favorable to the king</b><br>The phrase "with one accord" indicates a unanimous agreement among the prophets, who were likely court prophets serving King Ahab. This unanimity suggests a possible pressure to conform to the king's desires, reflecting a common issue in ancient Near Eastern courts where prophets might be tempted to speak what was pleasing to the king rather than the truth. The historical context reveals that Ahab often surrounded himself with prophets who would tell him what he wanted to hear, contrasting with the true prophets of God who spoke His word regardless of popularity or acceptance.<p><b>So please let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably</b><br>The messenger's plea to Micaiah to conform to the other prophets' favorable words underscores the cultural and political pressure to align with the king's wishes. This reflects a broader biblical theme where true prophets often stand alone against the majority, as seen with Elijah on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18) and later with Jeremiah. The request for Micaiah to "speak favorably" highlights the tension between human authority and divine truth, a recurring theme in Scripture. This moment foreshadows the New Testament, where Jesus Christ, the ultimate prophet, often spoke truth in the face of opposition and pressure to conform to societal expectations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micaiah.htm">Micaiah</a></b><br>A prophet of the Lord who is known for speaking the truth, regardless of the consequences.

The messenger&#8217;s plea for agreeable words spotlights humanity&#8217;s recurring desire for affirmation over truth. By recording this scene, Scripture warns believers to prize divine revelation above unanimous opinion, personal safety, or royal favor, trusting that God&#8217;s unchanging word outlasts every earthly agenda.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Behold now.</span>--In the whole history, as especially in the words of the officer, there is evidence of the strange confusion of idea, so common in superstition at all times, which in some sense believes in the inspiration of the prophets as coming from God, and yet fancies that they can direct it as they will, and that accordingly they can be bribed, or beguiled, or coerced, to "prophesy smooth things." The extremest form of this infatuation is exemplified in Simon Magus, who believed that the Apostles were the medium for conferring the highest spiritual gifts from God, and yet madly persuaded himself that this power could be bought for money (<a href="/context/acts/8-18.htm" title="And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,">Acts 8:18-19</a>). The natural result is a mingled awe and contempt, such as Balak feels for Balaam. The delusion is, of course, silenced at once by such declarations as the stern reply of Micaiah, which even Balaam could convey (<a href="/numbers/22-18.htm" title="And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.">Numbers 22:18</a>). But, as all false religions and corruptions of true religion show, it is never rooted out, except by real spiritual knowledge of God and of His dealings with the soul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the messenger that was gone</span> [or <span class="accented">went</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to call Micaiah, spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">one mouth good to the king</span>.
