The number four often symbolizes completeness or universality in the Bible, as seen in the four corners of the earth or the four living creatures in Revelation. The handles would have been practical for moving the stands, indicating the importance of mobility and functionality in temple service. This detail reflects the meticulous craftsmanship and attention to detail in the temple's construction, emphasizing the sacredness and orderliness of worship.<p><b>one for each corner</b><br>The mention of each corner having a handle suggests a design that ensures stability and balance. In biblical symbolism, corners can represent strength and foundation, as seen in the "cornerstone" metaphor for Christ (<a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>). The design of the stands, with handles at each corner, may symbolize the strength and stability of God's presence and the foundational role of the temple in Israel's spiritual life.<p><b>projecting from the stand</b><br>The projection of the handles from the stand indicates a design that is both functional and aesthetic. This detail highlights the craftsmanship of Hiram of Tyre, who was renowned for his skill in bronze work (<a href="/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13-14</a>). The projecting handles could also symbolize the outreach of God's presence from the temple to the people, much like how the church is called to extend the message of Christ to the world. The design reflects the beauty and grandeur of Solomon's temple, which was a physical representation of God's glory and majesty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple and his palace, including the construction of various furnishings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram.htm">Hiram (Huram)</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman from Tyre, hired by Solomon to create the bronze works for the temple, including the stands mentioned in this verse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_of_solomon.htm">Temple of Solomon</a></b><br>The first temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bronze_stands.htm">Bronze Stands</a></b><br>Part of the temple furnishings, these stands were used to support the basins for washing, showcasing the intricate craftsmanship and attention to detail in the temple's construction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/attention_to_detail_in_worship.htm">Attention to Detail in Worship</a></b><br>The detailed description of the temple furnishings, including the stands, highlights the importance of reverence and care in our worship practices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_of_skilled_workers.htm">God's Provision of Skilled Workers</a></b><br>Just as God provided Hiram to Solomon, He equips individuals with unique skills and talents for His purposes today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_purity_and_cleansing.htm">Symbolism of Purity and Cleansing</a></b><br>The stands supported basins for washing, symbolizing the need for spiritual cleansing and purity in approaching God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_community_in_building_god's_kingdom.htm">The Role of Community in Building God's Kingdom</a></b><br>The construction of the temple involved many skilled workers, illustrating the importance of community and collaboration in serving God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_of_faithful_service.htm">Legacy of Faithful Service</a></b><br>The enduring legacy of the temple's construction serves as a reminder of the lasting impact of faithful service to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_7_34_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 7:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_7_34_God_s_detailed_craft.htm">How does 1 Kings 7:34 reflect God's attention to detail in craftsmanship?

Uniformity reflects God&#8217;s order&#8212;mirroring the consistent pattern He gave Moses for the tabernacle furnishings (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Every piece served the same holy purpose, reminding us that God expects steadfast obedience from all His servants, not selective faithfulness (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording this detail, Scripture underscores its historical accuracy; the Holy Spirit inspired the writer to note even construction repetition so we would trust the whole account (<a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Had four handles</b><p>&#8226; Handles imply weight. These stands were solid bronze, supporting basins that held &#8220;forty baths&#8221; of water (about 240 gallons, <a href="/1_kings/7-38.htm">1 Kings 7:38</a>). Mobility required sturdy grips.<p>&#8226; Like the poles for the Ark (<a href="/exodus/25-12.htm">Exodus 25:12-15</a>) and the altar (<a href="/exodus/27-6.htm">Exodus 27:6-7</a>), handles kept human hands from touching consecrated surfaces, guarding reverence (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical design and spiritual symbolism meet: God equips His people to carry out worship without compromising holiness (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One for each corner</b><p>&#8226; Four corners distribute weight evenly, preventing tipping during transport&#8212;essential for preserving the purity of the water used by priests (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18-21</a>).<p>&#8226; The number four often signals completeness over the earth (<a href="/revelation/7-1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>). Placing a handle at every corner hints that cleansing is available to all who draw near (<a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Balance and symmetry showcase the Creator who &#8220;is not a God of disorder but of peace&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Projecting from the stand</b><p>&#8226; The handles were not separate add-ons but integral, &#8220;projecting from the stand.&#8221; In the same way, service to God isn&#8217;t an optional attachment to life; it grows out of our very identity (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Fixed handles meant the carts were always ready for duty, paralleling the unremovable poles of the Ark (<a href="/exodus/25-15.htm">Exodus 25:15</a>). God ordains lasting means for ongoing ministry (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>).<p>&#8226; Permanence in design foreshadows the unchanging character of Christ, the true cornerstone who supports every aspect of worship (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/7-34.htm">1 Kings 7:34</a>, though a single sentence about handles, reveals God&#8217;s meticulous care for worship. Uniform stands, weight-bearing handles, corner placement, and permanent projection all highlight order, holiness, accessibility, and steadfast service.
