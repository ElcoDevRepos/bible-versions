Solomon's reign is marked by wisdom and the establishment of peace and prosperity in Israel. Shimei, a member of the tribe of Benjamin, had previously cursed David during Absalom's rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-13</a>). David had spared Shimei's life, but on his deathbed, he instructed Solomon to deal with Shimei wisely (<a href="/1_kings/2-8.htm">1 Kings 2:8-9</a>). This summoning indicates Solomon's intention to fulfill his father's directive.<p><b>and said to him,</b><br>This phrase indicates a direct communication from Solomon to Shimei, emphasizing the personal nature of the king's command. It reflects the authority of the king and the seriousness of the situation. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a king's word was law, and direct communication from the king was a matter of grave importance.<p><b>&#8220;Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem</b><br>Solomon's command for Shimei to build a house in Jerusalem is significant. Jerusalem, the city of David, was the political and spiritual center of Israel. By instructing Shimei to reside there, Solomon is both restricting and protecting him. This command can be seen as a form of house arrest, ensuring Shimei's actions are monitored. The construction of a house also implies a degree of permanence and stability, suggesting a chance for Shimei to live peacefully if he obeys.<p><b>and live there,</b><br>Living in Jerusalem would place Shimei under the watchful eye of the king and his court. This command underscores the importance of obedience and the consequences of past actions. It also reflects the biblical theme of justice tempered with mercy, as Shimei is given a chance to live, albeit with restrictions. The city itself, being the site of the Temple, symbolizes God's presence and the centrality of worship in Israelite life.<p><b>but do not go anywhere else.</b><br>This restriction is a test of Shimei's loyalty and obedience. It serves as a protective measure for Solomon's reign, ensuring that Shimei, who had previously shown disloyalty, would not incite rebellion or cause trouble elsewhere. The command highlights the biblical principle of boundaries and the consequences of stepping outside them. It also foreshadows Shimei's eventual failure to comply, leading to his execution (<a href="/1_kings/2-39.htm">1 Kings 2:39-46</a>), illustrating the theme of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the king of Israel at this time.

The verse teaches that true repentance submits to rightful authority and that God-ordained rulers may set wise boundaries to restrain evil (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25-26</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">Called for Shimei</span>.--The command given to Shimei is in itself a reasonable precaution against treason, in one already powerful and of doubtful fidelity; and the reference to crossing the Kedron shows that it was designed to prevent his resorting to his native place, Bahurim. But it is difficult, in face of David's charge, to doubt that it was in some degree intended as a snare; and this view is confirmed by Solomon's words in <a href="/1_kings/2-44.htm" title="The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return your wickedness on your own head;">1Kings 2:44</a>, which refer back to the old offence of Shimei against David. The narrative gives no hint that Shimei's expedition to Gath was not made in good faith, simply to regain his slaves; and a command, which had its justification in the danger likely to result from his residence in Bahurim, among his own people, could hardly be disobeyed in spirit by a temporary journey to a foreign country. Legally the execution was justifiable, and it may have been politic; but it cannot stand examination on the ground of equity or generosity.
