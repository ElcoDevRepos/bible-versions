His summoning of Obadiah indicates a level of trust and reliance on Obadiah's capabilities. Obadiah, whose name means "servant of the LORD," held a significant position in Ahab's court despite the king's apostasy. This highlights the complex dynamics within the royal court, where even a faithful servant of God could serve under a wicked king. The summoning suggests an urgent or important task, likely related to the severe drought in the land, as described in the surrounding context of <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>.<p><b>who was in charge of the palace.</b><br>Obadiah's role as the palace administrator or steward was one of great responsibility, overseeing the king's household and affairs. This position required trustworthiness and competence, indicating that Obadiah was a man of integrity. His role can be compared to that of Joseph in Potiphar's house (<a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4</a>) or Daniel in the Babylonian court (<a href="/daniel/6-3.htm">Daniel 6:3</a>), where faithful men of God served in high positions within pagan governments. This demonstrates how God places His people in strategic positions to influence and protect His purposes, even in hostile environments.<p><b>(Now Obadiah greatly feared the LORD,</b><br>Obadiah's fear of the LORD signifies his deep reverence and commitment to God, contrasting with Ahab's idolatry. This fear is not terror but a profound respect and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and holiness. It aligns with the biblical principle that "the fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom" (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). Obadiah's faithfulness is further evidenced by his actions in hiding and providing for the prophets of the LORD during Jezebel's persecution (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>). His fear of the LORD sets him apart as a righteous man in a corrupt society, embodying the call to be "in the world but not of the world" (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his idolatry and marriage to Jezebel, which led Israel into sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/obadiah.htm">Obadiah</a></b><br>A devout believer in the LORD who held a high position as the overseer of Ahab's palace.
