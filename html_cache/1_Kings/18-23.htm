The choice of two bulls here sets the stage for a direct confrontation between the God of Israel and the pagan god Baal. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God demonstrating His power over false gods, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12).<p><b>Let the prophets of Baal choose one bull for themselves,</b><br>Allowing the prophets of Baal to choose their bull first demonstrates fairness and confidence in the true God's power. It also highlights the futility of Baal worship, as the prophets are given every advantage to succeed. This mirrors the biblical principle that God often allows His opponents to make the first move, only to reveal their powerlessness, as seen in the story of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17).<p><b>cut it into pieces,</b><br>The act of cutting the bull into pieces is a standard procedure in sacrificial rituals, as described in <a href="/leviticus/1-6.htm">Leviticus 1:6</a>. This process signifies preparation for a burnt offering, which was a common practice in both Israelite and Canaanite worship. The meticulous preparation underscores the seriousness of the challenge and the expectation of divine intervention.<p><b>and place it on the wood but not light the fire.</b><br>The instruction not to light the fire emphasizes the miraculous nature of the impending demonstration. In biblical narratives, fire often symbolizes God's presence and approval, as seen in the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) and the pillar of fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). This sets the stage for God to reveal Himself as the true source of power, contrasting with the impotence of Baal.<p><b>And I will prepare the other bull</b><br>Elijah's preparation of the second bull signifies his role as God's prophet and representative. This act of preparation is reminiscent of the meticulous care required in the Levitical sacrifices, highlighting the importance of obedience and reverence in worship. Elijah's actions foreshadow Christ's role as the ultimate sacrifice, prepared and offered for humanity's redemption.<p><b>and place it on the wood but not light the fire.</b><br>Repeating the instruction not to light the fire reinforces the challenge's fairness and the expectation of divine action. It underscores the theme of faith and reliance on God's power rather than human effort.

The challenge prepares Israel to witness that &#8220;the LORD, He is God&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/18-39.htm">1 Kings 18:39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/18-23.htm">1 Kings 18:23</a> details a fair, public test pitting the living God against Baal. By specifying two bulls, identical preparation, and a prohibition on man-made fire, Elijah removes every possibility of human manipulation. The verse spotlights God&#8217;s sovereignty over sacrifice, justice, and revelation. When fire falls only on Elijah&#8217;s altar, Israel sees unmistakably that the LORD alone is God&#8212;a timeless call to forsake idols and trust the Almighty who answers by fire.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces</span> [same word <a href="/exodus/29-17.htm">Exodus 29:17</a>; <a href="/leviticus/1-6.htm">Leviticus 1:6, 12</a>; <a href="/judges/20-6.htm">Judges 20:6</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and lay it on wood</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the woods</span>]<span class="accented">,<span class="cmt_word"></span> and put no fire under</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and fire they shall not set</span> to]: <span class="cmt_word">and I win dress</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">make</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x31;&#x46;&#x43;&#x30;&#x3b;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the LXX., is constantly used in a sacrificial sense = <span class="accented">offer</span>.
