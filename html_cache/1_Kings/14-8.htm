The kingdom was split into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. This division was a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). The tearing of the kingdom symbolizes God's judgment on Solomon's idolatry and disobedience (<a href="/1_kings/11-9.htm">1 Kings 11:9-13</a>). The "house of David" refers to the Davidic dynasty, which was promised an everlasting throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). However, due to Solomon's sins, God allowed the kingdom to be divided, though He preserved a remnant for David's sake.<p><b>But you have not been like My servant David,</b><br>David is often held as the standard for kingship in Israel due to his heart for God, despite his personal failings. The term "My servant" indicates a special relationship and covenant with God. David's life, characterized by repentance and a desire to follow God's will, contrasts sharply with Jeroboam's actions. Jeroboam led Israel into idolatry by setting up golden calves at Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>), which was a direct violation of the commandments.<p><b>who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart,</b><br>David's adherence to God's commandments is highlighted here, emphasizing his devotion and commitment to God's law. This phrase underscores the importance of wholehearted obedience and faithfulness to God. David's psalms often reflect his deep love for God's law (e.g., <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>). In contrast, Jeroboam's reign was marked by disobedience and a failure to trust in God's promises, leading to his downfall.<p><b>doing only what was right in My eyes.</b><br>This phrase indicates God's approval of David's overall conduct as king, despite his moral failures, such as the incident with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11). David's life is a testament to God's grace and forgiveness, as he repented and sought to restore his relationship with God (Psalm 51). The standard of "right in My eyes" is a recurring theme in the evaluation of Israel's kings, with many failing to meet this standard. Jeroboam's actions, in contrast, were seen as evil in God's sight, leading to judgment and the eventual downfall of his dynasty (<a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.
