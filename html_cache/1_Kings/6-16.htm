The measurement of twenty cubits (approximately 30 feet) indicates the size of this sacred space. The partitioning signifies the separation between the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place, emphasizing the sanctity and exclusivity of the latter. This design mirrors the tabernacle's structure, as described in <a href="/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>, where a veil separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place. The partitioning underscores the concept of holiness and the need for separation from sin, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>with cedar boards from floor to ceiling</b><br>Cedar wood was highly valued in ancient times for its durability, fragrance, and resistance to decay and insects. The use of cedar from floor to ceiling highlights the opulence and grandeur of the temple, reflecting the glory and majesty of God. Cedar was imported from Lebanon, as mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>, indicating the extensive trade networks and alliances Solomon established. The choice of cedar also connects to the construction of David's palace (<a href="/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>), symbolizing continuity and the fulfillment of God's promise to David regarding his son building the temple (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>).<p><b>to form within the temple an inner sanctuary</b><br>The inner sanctuary, or the Holy of Holies, was the most sacred part of the temple, where the Ark of the Covenant was placed. This space was considered the earthly dwelling place of God's presence among His people. Only the high priest could enter the inner sanctuary, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), as described in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>. This exclusivity underscores the holiness of God and the need for atonement and mediation between God and humanity.<p><b>the Most Holy Place</b><br>The Most Holy Place, or Holy of Holies, is a central theme in the temple's design, representing the ultimate meeting point between God and man. It prefigures the work of Jesus Christ, who, as the ultimate High Priest, entered the heavenly Most Holy Place once for all by His own blood, securing eternal redemption (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>). The tearing of the temple veil at Christ's crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>) symbolizes the removal of the barrier between God and humanity, granting believers direct access to God's presence through Jesus. This transformation from the physical temple to the spiritual access through Christ is a cornerstone of Christian theology.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem.

The cedar panelling was carved throughout with (see margin) "gourds and open flowers," probably festooned, as usual in ancient architecture.
