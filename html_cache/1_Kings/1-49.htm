The context is crucial here, as it marks a turning point in the narrative. Adonijah, who had declared himself king, was hosting a feast with his supporters. The sudden shift in power dynamics is a pivotal moment in the succession narrative of the Davidic kingdom.<p><b>all the guests of Adonijah</b><br>Adonijah's guests included influential figures who supported his claim to the throne. This gathering was a strategic move to consolidate power. The mention of "all the guests" underscores the widespread support Adonijah initially had, which included key leaders and military figures. This reflects the political tension and division within the kingdom at the time.<p><b>arose in terror</b><br>The reaction of terror indicates the fear of retribution from Solomon, now the legitimate king. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, a change in leadership often led to purges of the previous ruler's supporters. The guests' fear highlights the precariousness of political alliances and the potential for violence in royal successions.<p><b>and scattered</b><br>The scattering of Adonijah's guests signifies the collapse of his support base. This dispersal is symbolic of the failure of Adonijah's bid for the throne. It also reflects the broader theme of divine providence in the narrative, as Solomon's kingship was part of God's plan for Israel. The scattering can be seen as a fulfillment of divine justice, ensuring the continuation of the Davidic line through Solomon.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The son of King David who attempted to declare himself king without his father's blessing.

This is another indication that the royal power had been greatly consolidated during the last peaceful years of David's reign. Perhaps, moreover, the usurpation of Adonijah, not being viewed as a rebellion against David, but only a presumption on his favour, was accordingly crushed at once by the expression of his will. It is strange that of all the conspirators Adonijah alone seems to have feared punishment at this time; his accomplices, the other conspirators, are apparently allowed to disperse in safety, and their rebellion is ignored.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the guests</span> [Hebrews <span class="accented">called</span>, LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>] <span class="cmt_word">that were with</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">to</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Adonijah were afraid</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">trembled</span>] <span class="cmt_word">and rose up</span> [LXX. omits] <span class="cmt_word">and went every man his way.</span> [This fear and flight betray a consciousness of guilt.
