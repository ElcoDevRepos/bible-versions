Jeroboam's actions are compared unfavorably to those of previous leaders, highlighting the severity of his sins. Historically, Jeroboam's reign marked a significant departure from the worship of Yahweh, as he established alternative centers of worship in Bethel and Dan to prevent his people from going to Jerusalem. This act of setting up golden calves was a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). The phrase underscores the increasing moral and spiritual decline of Israel's leadership, setting a precedent for future kings.<p><b>You have proceeded to make for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke Me,</b><br>Jeroboam's creation of other gods and molten images was a deliberate act of idolatry, reminiscent of the sin of the golden calf in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>. This act was not only a political maneuver to consolidate his rule but also a spiritual betrayal of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The use of "molten images" indicates the crafting of idols, which was strictly forbidden (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>). This provocation is a direct affront to God, who is a jealous God (<a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>), and it reflects the broader cultural influences of surrounding nations that often worshipped multiple deities through physical representations.<p><b>and you have flung Me behind your back.</b><br>This vivid imagery suggests a complete disregard and rejection of God. To "fling" something behind one's back implies treating it as worthless or irrelevant. In the context of the covenant, this action symbolizes Israel's abandonment of their unique relationship with God, choosing instead to follow their own desires and the practices of pagan nations. This phrase echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16-18</a>, where God foretells Israel's future unfaithfulness and the resulting consequences. It also contrasts with the call to keep God's commandments and teachings at the forefront of one's life (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

The guilt, indeed, of Jeroboam's act was enhanced by the presumptuous contempt of the special promise of God, given on the sole condition of obedience. In respect of this, perhaps, he is said below--in an expression seldom used elsewhere--to have "cast God Himself behind his back." But probably the reference is mainly to the unprecedented effect of the sin, coming at a critical point in the history of Israel, and from that time onward poisoning the springs of national faith and worship. Other idolatries came and passed away: this continued, and at all times "made Israel to sin."<p><span class= "bld">Other gods and molten images.</span>--See in <a href="/1_kings/11-28.htm" title="And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.">1Kings 11:28</a> the repetition of the older declaration in the wilderness, "These be thy gods, O Israel." Jeroboam would have justified the use of the calves as simply emblems of the true God; Ahijah rejects the plea, holding these molten images, expressly forbidden in the Law, to be really objects of worship--"other gods,"--as, indeed, all experience shows that such forbidden emblems eventually tend to become. Moreover, from <a href="/1_kings/14-15.htm" title="For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.">1Kings 14:15</a> it appears that the foul worship of the <span class= "ital">Asherah</span> ("groves") associated itself with the idolatry of Jeroboam.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But hast done evil above all that were before thee</span> [perhaps preceding <span class="accented">kings</span> are not meant, so much as judges - <span class="accented">judices et duces Israelis</span> (Le Clerc).
