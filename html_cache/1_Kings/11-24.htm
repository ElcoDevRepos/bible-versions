This reflects a common practice where individuals with military prowess or leadership skills attracted others seeking protection or gain. This gathering of men can be seen as a precursor to forming a political or military faction, similar to how David gathered his mighty men (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>).<p><b>When David killed the Zobaites</b><br>This refers to David's military campaigns against various groups, including the Zobaites, who were likely part of the Aramean confederation. David's victories over these groups are recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3-8</a>, where he expanded Israel's territory and influence. The defeat of the Zobaites would have created a power vacuum, allowing figures like Rezon to rise.<p><b>Rezon captained a band of raiders</b><br>Rezon's role as a captain of raiders indicates his leadership and tactical skills. Bands of raiders were common in the ancient Near East, often surviving by plundering settlements and caravans. This activity would have been disruptive to established powers, similar to the raids conducted by David before he became king (<a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8-11</a>).<p><b>and went to Damascus</b><br>Damascus, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, was a strategic location in the ancient Near East. By moving to Damascus, Rezon positioned himself in a key trade and military hub. This move mirrors the strategic relocations of other biblical figures, such as Abraham's journey to Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-5</a>).<p><b>where they settled and gained control</b><br>Rezon's settlement and control of Damascus suggest a successful establishment of power, likely through both military strength and political alliances. This control foreshadows the later prominence of Damascus as a center of Aramean power, which would become a significant adversary to Israel (<a href="/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>).

The kingdom of Zobah was evidently a powerful state at that time, at war with the Syrian kingdom of Hamath, but holding supremacy over the Syrians of Damascus, and the "Syrians beyond the river" Euphrates; and (as the record shows) accumulating vast treasures of gold, silver, and brass. The establishment of Rezon (and Hadad?) at Damascus must have taken place later; for at the time we find that David "put governors in Damascus," and reduced its inhabitants to a tributary condition. Possibly there may have been some rising early in the reign of Solomon; for in <a href="/2_chronicles/8-3.htm" title="And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.">2Chronicles 8:3</a>, we find that Solomon had to "go up against Hamath-zobah," with which expedition the foundation of Tadmor seems to be connected. But it is probable that the establishment of an independent power in Damaseus dated only from the later days of Solomon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band</span> [either of rebels before or of fugitives after the defeat], <span class="cmt_word">when David slew them of Zobah</span> [<span class="accented">Of Zobah</span>, not in Hebrews "Them" must mean the Syrian army]: <span class="cmt_word">and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein</span> [As David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus (<a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>), this must have been some time <span class="accented">after</span> the defeat of the Syrians. But Keil argues that it cannot have been in the middle or later part of Solomon's reign, inasmuch as Solomon must have been lord of Damascus, or he could not have built Palmyra. But it is not so incontrovertibly settled that Solomon did build Palmyra (see on 1 Kings 9:18) as to make this argument of much weight.

The word "reigned," however (plural), is somewhat remarkable. It may perhaps be accounted for by the plurals which precede it. The insertion of one "yod" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5db;&#x5d5;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5db;&#x5d5;</span>) gives the sense "<span class="accented">they</span> <span class="accented">made him king</span>," which would certainly be preferable, if the emendation were not purely conjectural. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/11-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and had gathered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;b&#333;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
