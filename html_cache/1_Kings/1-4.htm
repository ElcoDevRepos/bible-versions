In biblical times, physical beauty was often noted as a significant attribute, as seen with figures like Sarah, Rebekah, and Esther. Abishag's beauty is emphasized to underscore her suitability for the role she was to play in King David's court. The mention of her beauty also sets the stage for later events involving Adonijah's request to marry her, which Solomon interprets as a political maneuver (<a href="/1_kings/2-22.htm">1 Kings 2:22</a>). The Shunammite origin suggests she was from Shunem, a town in the territory of Issachar, which is in the northern part of Israel, indicating the widespread recognition of her beauty.<p><b>she cared for the king and served him,</b><br>Abishag's role was to care for King David in his old age, providing warmth and companionship. This reflects the cultural practices of the time, where a young woman might be brought in to serve an elderly or ailing king. Her service was likely multifaceted, involving personal care and attending to the king's needs. This role is reminiscent of the care provided by Ruth to Naomi, highlighting themes of loyalty and service. The use of the term "served" indicates a position of humility and dedication, which is a recurring theme in Scripture, pointing to the ideal of servanthood exemplified by Jesus Christ (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>but he had no relations with her.</b><br>This clarifies that the relationship between David and Abishag was not sexual, which is significant given the cultural context where kings often had multiple wives and concubines. The statement preserves David's integrity in his final days and distinguishes Abishag's role from that of a concubine. This detail is crucial in understanding the later political implications when Adonijah seeks to marry Abishag, as it would have been seen as a claim to the throne. The restraint shown by David here can be contrasted with his earlier life, where his relationships with women led to significant personal and political turmoil (2 Samuel 11). This phrase underscores the theme of purity and the importance of intentions in relationships, aligning with biblical teachings on sexual morality.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The aging king of Israel, who is in need of care due to his frailty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abishag_the_shunammite.htm">Abishag the Shunammite</a></b><br>A young and beautiful woman chosen to care for King David in his old age.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shunem.htm">Shunem</a></b><br>The town from which Abishag hails, located in the territory of Issachar.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_royal_court.htm">The Royal Court</a></b><br>The setting where the events unfold, highlighting the political and personal dynamics at play.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_succession_crisis.htm">The Succession Crisis</a></b><br>The broader context of the chapter, where the question of who will succeed David as king is a pressing issue.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_service.htm">The Role of Service</a></b><br>Abishag's role highlights the importance of serving others, especially those in need.

Such physical description is rare and always purposeful, highlighting how the Lord sometimes uses outward attributes to move events forward (<a href="/esther/2-7.htm">Esther 2:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/24-16.htm">Genesis 24:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Her beauty magnifies the contrast between youthful vigor and David&#8217;s frailty (<a href="/1_kings/1-1.htm">1 Kings 1:1</a>), reminding us that &#8220;all flesh is like grass&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-24.htm">1 Peter 1:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the Word is true, we take this statement literally: Abishag truly stood out among Israel&#8217;s women, positioning her as a significant yet unintended symbol in the coming succession drama (<a href="/1_kings/2-13.htm">1 Kings 2:13&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she cared for the king</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Cared&#8221; conveys practical, compassionate attention&#8212;she nursed, comforted, and kept the aged monarch warm (<a href="/1_kings/1-2.htm">1 Kings 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; God often provides human agents to meet physical needs, a pattern seen with Ruth and Naomi (<a href="/ruth/4-15.htm">Ruth 4:15</a>) and the women who ministered to Jesus (<a href="/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; David, once the shepherd-king caring for others (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70&#8211;72</a>), now receives care, illustrating the biblical principle that seasons of strength and weakness both lie under God&#8217;s sovereign hand (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and served him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Served&#8221; points to loyal attendance in the royal household, similar to the service of the Levites in the temple (<a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6</a>) or Elisha&#8217;s service to Elijah (<a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Her role was honorable, not degrading; Scripture elevates humble service as greatness (<a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26&#8211;28</a>).<p>&#8226; Abishag&#8217;s faithful presence underscores David&#8217;s continued dignity as king&#8212;even in decline the Lord preserved order around His anointed (<a href="/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he had no relations with her</b><p>&#8226; The text plainly states there was no sexual intimacy.

Her beauty frames the moment; her care and service reveal the Lord&#8217;s provision; David&#8217;s abstinence both protects her and spotlights his infirmity. Taken together, the verse underscores human frailty, divine ordering of events, and the moral clarity Scripture consistently affirms.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the damsel was very fair</span> [lit. <span class="accented">,fair to exceeding</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and cherished</span> [see on ver. 2] <span class="cmt_word">the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.</span> [This is mentioned to explain the history of <a href="/1_kings/2-13.htm">1 Kings 2:13-25</a>. Had it been otherwise, Adonijah could never have presumed to seek her in marriage, and Bathsheba would never have promised her help in his suit. Such an incestuous alliance would not only have been contrary to the law (<a href="/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8</a>), but abhorrent to all true Israelites (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>). In this fact, which the court knew, and which the nation at large did not know - <span class="accented">they</span> could only suppose that such a "search" for one so exceeding "fair" meant the increase of the seraglio - Adoni-jah found his <span class="accented">point d'appui</span> for a second attempt on the throne. The older expositors and some of the modern, notably Wordsworth, assume that Abishag was David's wife, in the sense of being legally married to him. (Corn. A Lap. discusses the question at considerable length, and with needless pruriency.) But this idea finds no support in Scripture, which represents her as simply an attendant. It is idle to remark, consequently, that "the Jewish law allowed polygamy" (Rawlinson). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/1-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The girl</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;han&#183;na&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
