Bronze was a common material for tools and weapons in the ancient Near East, symbolizing strength and durability. The four wheels suggest mobility, indicating that these stands could be moved as needed within the temple complex. This mobility may symbolize the dynamic nature of God's presence among His people, reminiscent of the wheels in Ezekiel's vision (<a href="/ezekiel/1-15.htm">Ezekiel 1:15-21</a>), which also signify divine movement and presence.<p><b>with bronze axles</b><br>The axles, also made of bronze, highlight the craftsmanship and attention to detail in the temple's construction. The use of bronze for both wheels and axles ensures durability and functionality. This detail underscores the importance of the temple as a place of worship and the need for its furnishings to be both beautiful and practical. The strength of bronze may also symbolize the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>and a basin resting on four supports</b><br>The basin, or laver, was used for ceremonial washing, an essential part of the temple rituals. The four supports indicate stability and balance, ensuring the basin remained secure. This reflects the importance of purity and cleanliness in worship, as seen in the instructions for the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17-21</a>). The number four often represents completeness in the Bible, suggesting the comprehensive nature of the cleansing provided by God.<p><b>with wreaths at each side</b><br>The decorative wreaths add an element of beauty and artistry to the stands, reflecting the glory and majesty of God. Wreaths are often associated with victory and honor, possibly symbolizing the triumph of God's presence and the honor due to Him in worship. This detail connects to the broader biblical theme of God's beauty and the splendor of His creation, as seen in the intricate designs of the tabernacle and temple (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-40</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple and its furnishings, including the stands described in this verse.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram_of_tyre.htm">Hiram of Tyre</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman who was brought in to create the bronze works for the temple, including the stands with wheels.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where these bronze stands were used as part of the temple furnishings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bronze_stands.htm">Bronze Stands</a></b><br>These were part of the temple furnishings, used to hold basins for washing, symbolizing purification and preparation for worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wheels_and_axles.htm">Wheels and Axles</a></b><br>The practical design elements that allowed the stands to be moved, indicating the importance of mobility and adaptability in worship practices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_purity.htm">Symbolism of Purity</a></b><br>The bronze stands and basins were used for washing, symbolizing the need for spiritual cleansing before approaching God.

The four wheels made each stand movable, letting the priests roll the heavy bronze basins to wherever cleansing was needed.<p>&#8226; The mobility points to an ever-present provision of purification&#8212;echoing how God made living water available in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>) and how He now brings cleansing to every willing heart (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>).<p>&#8226; Because there are four wheels, the image hints at completeness&#8212;water ready on every side of the altar court. Ezekiel later pictures four wheels beside the living creatures (<a href="/ezekiel/1-15.htm">Ezekiel 1:15-21</a>), again underscoring God&#8217;s readiness to act in any direction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bronze axles</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;with bronze axles&#8221;<p>&#8226; The axles, forged from the same metal as the wheels, underline durability. Bronze, produced by fire, stands for righteous judgment that has endured the flame (<a href="/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8-9</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The unbroken bronze construction assures the worshiper that God&#8217;s cleansing provision rests on His unchanging, fire-tested character (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Since the axles connected wheel to stand, they picture the link between God&#8217;s holiness and His ministry of mercy: judgment borne allows cleansing to roll freely to His people (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Basin on four supports</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and a basin resting on four supports&#8221;<p>&#8226; The basin (about 40 gallons each, <a href="/1_kings/7-38.htm">1 Kings 7:38</a>) held water for washing the sacrificed animals, fulfilling the same purpose as the larger &#8220;Sea&#8221; but on a smaller, more accessible scale (<a href="/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Four supports kept the basin stable, reminding us that God&#8217;s sanctifying work is firmly established. Just as the Gospel stands on the fourfold witness of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the laver&#8217;s water was upheld on all sides.<p>&#8226; Cleansing precedes fellowship: the priests could not approach the altar without washing, foreshadowing Christ who &#8220;loved the church and gave Himself up for her, to sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Wreaths at each side</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;with wreaths at each side.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Decorative wreaths (garlands or festoons) encircled the stand, transforming a utilitarian piece into something beautiful. God makes even practical obedience lovely (<a href="/psalms/29-2.htm">Psalm 29:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Wreath imagery throughout Scripture signals victory and honor (<a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>). Here, the adornment celebrates the triumph of holiness&#8212;sin washed away, sacrifice made acceptable.<p>&#8226; The Spirit adorns believers in the same way: &#8220;He has clothed me with garments of salvation&#8230; as a bride adorns herself with her jewels&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>). Purity is never drab; it is resplendent with God&#8217;s artistry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/7-30.htm">1 Kings 7:30</a> records far more than architectural details. The four bronze wheels and axles picture God&#8217;s cleansing mercy on the move; the basin on four supports shows that mercy securely anchored; the wreaths proclaim the beauty and victory of holiness. Every element invites us to trust the finished work of Christ, draw near, and live washed, mobile, and adorned for the service of our King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And every base had four brazen wheels</span> [As the lavers were used for washing "such things as they offered for burnt offering" (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-6.htm">2 Chronicles 4:6</a>), and consequently would require to be continually emptied and refilled, they must of necessity be moveable, so that they could be taken, now to the sea, or other reservoir, now to the altar], <span class="cmt_word">and plates</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">axles</span>] <span class="cmt_word">of brass: and the four corners</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">feet</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> signifies <span class="accented">step</span>, thence <span class="accented">foot</span>, and is here used of artificial feet.

He thus understands the "shoulder" to extend from the foot, or axletree, to the bottom of the laver. But it seems quite as likely that these shoulders were <span class="accented">within</span> the stand; that they started from its upper corners, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "from under the laver" (as in the Hebrew), passed down along its inner angles, and emerged below - the stand may well have had no bottom - in the shape of feet or forks, which rested on the axletrees, and supported both stand and ]aver. Over against this internal shoulder blade or support was placed externally a wreath. But Bahr despairs of arriving at any just and adequate understanding of this arrangement, and, in the absence of drawings, it is perhaps hopeless that we shall ever interpret the words with certainty.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/7-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Each</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
