The old prophet's actions highlight the theme of false prophecy and deception, which is a recurring issue in Israel's history. The phrase also underscores the importance of discernment and obedience to God's word, as seen in other biblical narratives such as the deception of Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>he said, &#8220;It is the man of God who disobeyed the command of the LORD.</b><br>The man of God is identified as having disobeyed a direct command from the LORD, emphasizing the seriousness of his transgression. This reflects the biblical principle that disobedience to God's commands, especially by those who are His messengers, carries severe consequences. This theme is echoed in the story of Saul's disobedience in <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>, where partial obedience is shown to be inadequate.<p><b>Therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion,</b><br>The lion is often a symbol of God's judgment in the Bible, as seen in other passages like <a href="/daniel/6.htm">Daniel 6</a> and <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>. The use of a lion here signifies divine intervention and the fulfillment of God's word. The phrase "delivered him to the lion" indicates that the judgment was not random but a direct act of God, reinforcing the idea of divine sovereignty and justice.<p><b>and it has mauled him and killed him,</b><br>The mauling and killing by the lion serve as a physical manifestation of the spiritual consequences of disobedience. This act of judgment is both immediate and final, illustrating the seriousness with which God views the violation of His commands. It also serves as a warning to others about the dangers of straying from God's instructions.<p><b>according to the word that the LORD had spoken to him.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase confirms the fulfillment of God's prophetic word, underscoring the reliability and authority of divine revelation. It serves as a reminder that God's words are not to be taken lightly and that His promises and warnings will come to pass. This is consistent with the broader biblical narrative, where God's word is always fulfilled, as seen in the prophecies concerning Jesus Christ in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>A prophet from Judah who was sent by God to deliver a message against the altar at Bethel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_old_prophet.htm">The Old Prophet</a></b><br>An older prophet living in Bethel who deceived the man of God into disobeying God's command.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant location in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, where King Jeroboam set up a golden calf for worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lion.htm">The Lion</a></b><br>An instrument of God's judgment, used to fulfill the prophecy against the man of God for his disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_the_lord.htm">The Word of the LORD</a></b><br>The divine command given to the man of God, which he ultimately disobeyed due to deception.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Obedience to God's word is paramount, even when faced with conflicting messages from others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_spiritual_matters.htm">Discernment in Spiritual Matters</a></b><br>Believers must exercise discernment and seek confirmation from God when receiving messages that contradict His known will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Disobedience to God can lead to severe consequences, as seen in the man of God's fate.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_deception.htm">The Role of Deception</a></b><br>Deception can come from unexpected sources, even those who appear to be spiritual authorities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God's justice is perfect, and His sovereignty is evident in how He fulfills His word, even through unexpected means.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_13_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 13:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_13_26_Disobedience_s_outcome.htm">How does 1 Kings 13:26 illustrate the consequences of disobedience to God's commands?
