This moment occurs after Elijah has traveled a day's journey into the desert, seeking refuge and solace. His looking around signifies a moment of awakening and realization, as he is in a state of despair and exhaustion. This phrase highlights the human aspect of Elijah, who, despite his great faith and previous victories, experiences fear and doubt.<p><b>and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals</b><br>The provision of bread baked over hot coals is reminiscent of God's miraculous provision for His people throughout the Bible, such as the manna provided to the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 16). The bread signifies sustenance and God's care for Elijah's physical needs. The use of hot coals suggests a simple, yet effective means of preparation, indicating the immediacy and practicality of God's provision. This also foreshadows the provision of Christ, the Bread of Life, who sustains believers spiritually.<p><b>and a jar of water</b><br>Water, a symbol of life and purification, is provided alongside the bread. In the arid wilderness, water is a precious resource, emphasizing God's ability to provide abundantly even in desolate circumstances. This provision mirrors the living water that Jesus offers, as seen in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, where He speaks to the Samaritan woman at the well. The jar of water represents God's ongoing care and the refreshment He offers to those who are weary.<p><b>So he ate and drank</b><br>Elijah's act of eating and drinking demonstrates his acceptance of God's provision and care. It is a moment of obedience and trust, as he allows himself to be nourished and restored. This act can be seen as a precursor to the Last Supper, where Jesus provides bread and wine to His disciples, symbolizing His body and blood given for the salvation of humanity. Elijah's physical nourishment parallels the spiritual nourishment that believers receive through Christ.<p><b>and lay down again</b><br>After receiving sustenance, Elijah lays down again, indicating his continued need for rest and recovery. This highlights the importance of physical rest in conjunction with spiritual renewal. It also reflects the human condition of needing repeated restoration, a theme echoed in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where the Lord is described as a shepherd who makes His people lie down in green pastures. Elijah's rest signifies a temporary reprieve, pointing to the ultimate rest found in Christ, who invites all who are weary to come to Him for rest (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who is fleeing from Queen Jezebel after a great victory over the prophets of Baal.
