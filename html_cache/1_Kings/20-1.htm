The name "Ben-hadad" means "son of Hadad," with Hadad being the storm god worshiped in the region. This particular Ben-hadad is likely Ben-hadad II, who reigned during the time of King Ahab of Israel. The assembling of his entire army indicates a significant military campaign, suggesting a major threat to Israel. Aram was a frequent adversary of Israel, and their conflicts are well-documented throughout the Old Testament, highlighting the ongoing struggle for power and dominance in the region.<p><b>Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots,</b><br>The mention of thirty-two kings suggests a coalition of smaller city-states or tribal leaders allied with Ben-hadad. This coalition would have provided a formidable force, as each king would contribute troops, horses, and chariots, which were the premier military technology of the time. Horses and chariots symbolize strength and speed in warfare, often giving an army a significant advantage. The use of chariots is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament, underscoring their importance in ancient Near Eastern military strategy. This coalition reflects the political landscape of the time, where alliances were crucial for military success.<p><b>he marched up, besieged Samaria,</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, established by King Omri and fortified by his son Ahab. The city's strategic location made it a prime target for invading forces. A siege was a common military tactic used to cut off a city from supplies and reinforcements, often leading to surrender due to starvation or lack of resources. The siege of Samaria indicates the seriousness of Ben-hadad's campaign and his intent to subdue Israel. This event is part of a larger narrative of conflict between Israel and Aram, illustrating the constant threat faced by the Northern Kingdom from its neighbors.<p><b>and waged war against it.</b><br>The act of waging war against Samaria signifies a direct and aggressive attempt to conquer the city and, by extension, the kingdom of Israel. This conflict is part of the broader theme of warfare in the Old Testament, where nations often clashed over territory, resources, and power. The wars between Israel and Aram are chronicled in several biblical accounts, reflecting the turbulent history of the region. This phrase also sets the stage for the subsequent events in the chapter, where God's intervention and the role of the prophet play a crucial part in the unfolding narrative. The warfare here can be seen as a backdrop for demonstrating God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His purposes through the history of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria), who is leading a coalition of kings against Israel.

Each detail&#8212;the powerful king, the total mobilization, the thirty-two allied rulers, the upward march, the encirclement of Samaria, and the active warfare&#8212;piles up evidence of hopeless odds. By recording the threat so vividly, Scripture prepares us to see the LORD&#8217;s saving power displayed in the rest of the chapter, reminding believers that no coalition of earthly forces can thwart God&#8217;s faithful purposes for His people (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-19</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Ben-hadad.</span>--This is the inherited title of the Syrian kings. (See <a href="/amos/1-4.htm" title="But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.">Amos 1:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-27.htm" title="And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.">Jeremiah 49:27</a>.) From the allusion in <a href="/1_kings/20-34.htm" title="And Ben-hadad said to him, The cities, which my father took from your father, I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send you away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.">1Kings 20:34</a> it appears that this Ben-hadad was the son of a king who had been victorious against Omri--possibly pushing still further the advantage gained in the time of Baasha. It is evident that he assumed, perhaps by inheritance, a sovereignty over Israel.<p><span class= "bld">Thirty and two kings.</span>--All the notices of Syria show it as divided into small kingdoms, confederated from time to time under some leading power. In the days of David this leading power was that of Hadadezer of Zobah (<a href="/context/2_samuel/8-3.htm" title="David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.">2Samuel 8:3-13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-19.htm" title="And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.">2Samuel 10:19</a>), although Hamath was apparently independent. Now Damascus, under the dynasty of Hadad, assumes a most formidable predominance. Ahab cannot stand before it, but shuts himself up, probably after defeat, within the strong walls of Samaria. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ben-hadad</span> [See on 1 Kings 11:14 and 1 Kings 15:18.

But Ben-hadad was clearly a vain and overbearing and tyrannical prince, and the only crime of Israel may have been that it was independent of him, or had refused to do him homage.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/20-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;en-)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">Ben-hadad</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1491;&#1463;&#1443;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;&#7695;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
