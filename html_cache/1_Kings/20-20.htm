The context is a battle between the Israelites and the Arameans, where God promised victory to Ahab despite the odds. This mirrors other biblical instances where God grants victory to His people, such as David's triumph over Goliath (1 Samuel 17). The personal nature of the combat underscores the courage and skill of the Israelite soldiers, reminiscent of the judges like Gideon who led Israel to victory against overwhelming forces (Judges 7).<p><b>So the Arameans fled,</b><br>The flight of the Arameans signifies a turning point in the battle, demonstrating the fulfillment of God's promise to deliver the Arameans into the hands of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13</a>). This retreat is a common motif in biblical battles where God intervenes, as seen in the Exodus narrative when the Egyptians fled before the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/14-25.htm">Exodus 14:25</a>). The Arameans' retreat also reflects the fear and confusion that often accompany divine intervention in warfare.<p><b>with the Israelites in pursuit.</b><br>The pursuit by the Israelites indicates their complete dominance in the battle, a common practice in ancient warfare to ensure a decisive victory. This pursuit can be compared to Joshua's campaigns, where the Israelites chased their enemies to secure the land promised by God (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>). The relentless pursuit underscores the Israelites' obedience to God's command to defeat their enemies completely.<p><b>But Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with the cavalry.</b><br>Ben-hadad's escape highlights the incomplete nature of the victory, as the enemy king survives. This escape sets the stage for future conflicts between Israel and Aram. The use of cavalry indicates the wealth and military sophistication of the Arameans, as horses were valuable assets in ancient warfare. Ben-hadad's survival can be seen as a test for Ahab, who later fails to fully obey God's command regarding Ben-hadad, leading to future consequences (<a href="/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>). This escape also foreshadows the recurring theme of incomplete obedience leading to future troubles, as seen in Saul's failure to fully destroy the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) who led a coalition against Israel.

By chasing the Syrians, Israel obeyed fully, like Joshua pressing the advantage at Gibeon (<a href="/joshua/10-19.htm">Joshua 10:19</a>). Their chase underscores the principle, &#8220;Resist the devil, and he will flee&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>), yet resistance must continue until the threat is removed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ben-hadad Escapes on Horseback with the Cavalry</b><p>&#8220;But Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with the cavalry&#8221; (v. 20 c) shows:<p>&#8226; Human pride still plotting: the king trusted swift horses (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>) instead of submitting to the LORD who had just exposed his weakness.<p>&#8226; A test for Ahab: God allowed Ben-hadad to survive so He could measure Israel&#8217;s faithfulness later (<a href="/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>).

Probably, as in these cases, the Israelites may have risen from various lurking-places to join in the pursuit and slaughter. It does not necessarily follow that the event was miraculous.
