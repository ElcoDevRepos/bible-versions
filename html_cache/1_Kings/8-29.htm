Solomon's request for God's eyes to be open signifies a desire for God's continual attention and protection over the temple. The temple in Jerusalem was the central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The idea of God's eyes being open is also found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, which speaks of the Lord's eyes being on the righteous. This request for divine attention underscores the importance of the temple as a place of ongoing communication and relationship with God.<p><b>toward the place of which You said, &#8216;My Name shall be there,&#8217;</b><br>The phrase "My Name shall be there" indicates God's promise to dwell among His people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>. The temple was not just a physical structure but a representation of God's covenantal presence. In ancient Israel, a name was more than a label; it represented character and authority. God's name being in the temple signifies His ownership and the manifestation of His divine presence. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus refers to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), indicating the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence among His people through Christ.<p><b>so that You may hear the prayer that Your servant prays toward this place</b><br>Solomon's prayer emphasizes the temple as a focal point for prayer and divine-human interaction. The act of praying toward the temple signifies a directed and intentional communication with God, acknowledging His presence and authority. This practice is mirrored in <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>, where Daniel prays toward Jerusalem despite being in exile. The temple serves as a symbol of hope and a reminder of God's promises. In the New Testament, Jesus teaches about prayer in <a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9-13</a>, highlighting the importance of approaching God with reverence and faith, principles rooted in the temple worship of the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem.

Just as <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a> affirms, &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous,&#8221; he trusts that God literally watches over His dwelling. The temple is not a mere symbol; it is the chosen spot where God promises to focus His gaze (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-20.htm">2 Chronicles 6:20</a>). Because God&#8217;s Word is true, Solomon can confidently ask that the divine eyes remain fixed on this house.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s &#8220;open eyes&#8221; imply protection (<a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>) and favor (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; The petition recognizes that any blessing on Israel flows from God&#8217;s active oversight (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Night and day</b><p>The request spans every moment. Daylight hours bring sacrifices and gatherings; nighttime brings individual cries and silent supplication. In <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21&#8211;22</a> God guided Israel &#8220;day and night,&#8221; so Solomon expects unbroken vigilance here too. <a href="/isaiah/27-3.htm">Isaiah 27:3</a> later echoes this, &#8220;I, the LORD, watch over it; I water it continually. I guard it night and day.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Continuous attention assures Israel that no hour is off-limits for seeking help (<a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This around-the-clock coverage foreshadows Christ&#8217;s promise to be &#8220;with you always&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Toward the place of which You said, &#8216;My Name shall be there&#8217;</b><p>God Himself selected Jerusalem as the geographic center of worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>). &#8220;My Name&#8221; represents His character, authority, and covenant faithfulness. By anchoring His Name to the temple, the LORD offers a physical guarantee of His invisible reality.<p>&#8226; The temple&#8217;s holiness derives from God&#8217;s declaration, not human craftsmanship (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Later exiles like Daniel faced Jerusalem when praying (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>), showing they believed this promise remained in force even when far away.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that You may hear the prayer that Your servant prays toward this place</b><p>The ultimate goal is answered prayer. Solomon acts as &#8220;servant,&#8221; trusting the covenant Lord to respond (<a href="/1_kings/8-52.htm">1 Kings 8:52</a>). God&#8217;s hearing is relational, not mechanical; proximity to the temple signifies alignment with His revealed will.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-15.htm">2 Chronicles 7:15</a> records God&#8217;s immediate reply: &#8220;Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Believers today draw near through Christ, the true Temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19&#8211;21</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>), confident that God still hears.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a> points to a real, chosen location where God promises to watch, dwell, and respond. Solomon&#8217;s plea&#8212;rooted in God&#8217;s own words&#8212;invites Israel to approach with assurance that the LORD sees every moment, honors His Name, and hears every prayer directed toward His designated house. For all who stand on the unchanging truth of Scripture, the verse still calls us to seek the God who attentively watches &#8220;night and day&#8221; and delights to answer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That thine eyes may be open</span> [This anthropomorphism does not conflict with what was said under ver. 27] <span class="cmt_word">toward this house night and day</span> [not so much to watch over it as to see the worship and prayer offered there], <span class="cmt_word">even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there</span> [cf. <a href="/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>, and vers. 18. 19, 20, etc. When had God said this?
