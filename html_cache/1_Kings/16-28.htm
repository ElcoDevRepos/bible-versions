And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and turned not from it, <i>even</i> from doing right in the eyes of the Lord: only they removed not <i>any</i> of the high places; they sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places. Now the engagements which Josaphat made with the king of Israel, and all his mighty deeds which he performed, and the enemies whom he fought against, behold, <i>are</i> not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? and the remains of the prostitution which they practiced in the days of Asa his father, he removed out of the land: and there was no king in Syria, <i>but</i> a deputy. and king Josaphat made a ship at Tharsis to go to Sophir for gold: but it went not, for the ship was broken at Gasion Gaber. Then the king of Israel said to Josaphat, I will send forth thy servants and my servants in the ship: but Josaphat would not.

The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a joining with ancestors in the afterlife. Omri's reign was significant for establishing a powerful dynasty and for his political and military achievements, including the establishment of Samaria as the capital. His death marks the end of his influence and the beginning of his son Ahab's reign, which would be marked by significant religious and political challenges.<p><b>and was buried in Samaria</b><br>Samaria, the city Omri founded, became the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Its strategic location and fertile surroundings made it a significant center of power. Archaeological excavations have uncovered evidence of Omri's building projects, which contributed to the city's prominence. Being buried in Samaria signifies Omri's lasting legacy and the importance of the city as a royal burial site, reflecting the practice of kings being interred in their capital cities.<p><b>and his son Ahab reigned in his place</b><br>Ahab's ascension to the throne marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history. Known for his marriage to Jezebel and the introduction of Baal worship, Ahab's reign is characterized by religious apostasy and conflict with the prophet Elijah. This transition of power highlights the dynastic continuity established by Omri, yet it also sets the stage for the spiritual and moral decline that would lead to divine judgment. Ahab's reign is extensively documented in the biblical narrative, illustrating the consequences of turning away from the covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/omri.htm">Omri</a></b><br>The sixth king of Israel, known for establishing Samaria as the capital of the Northern Kingdom.

It illustrates three truths: every ruler dies, earthly achievements cannot mask spiritual failure, and ungodly legacies often deepen across generations.

THE REIGN OF AHAB. - With the accession of Ahab a new main section of our history begins - the section which has its close in the destruction of the house of Omri by Jehu, as related in <a href="/2_kings/10.htm">2 Kings 10</a>. And this reign is recorded at unusual length; in fact, it occupies nearly all the remaining portion of this volume, whereas the reigns of preceding kings have in several instances been dismissed in a few verses. It owes this distinction to the ministry of the great prophet Elijah by which it was marked, and, indeed, was profoundly influenced; but this ministry, it must be remembered, was necessitated by the critical circumstances of the time. It may be that "every age thinks itself a crisis," but no one can fail to see that this was one of the veritable turning points of Jewish history. One of the real "decisive battles of the world" - that between the Lord and Baal - was then fought out. No wonder that our historian felt constrained to chronicle at length the transactions of a reign so pregnant both with good and evil for the people of the Lord and for the faith with which they had been put in trust. Indeed, the same guiding principle which led him to devote so many of his pages to the reign of Solomon, when the theocratic kingdom was at its highest, impelled him to linger over the reign of Ahab when religion was at its lowest ebb. The secular historian, too often like the sundial which "counts no hours save those serene," draws a veil over the time of his country's decadence, or touches its misfortunes with a light hand. It is only in the inspired records that we have an impartial register both of the glory and shame of a common. wealth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/16-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Omri</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6018.htm">Strong's 6018: </a> </span><span class="str2">Omri -- a king of Israel, also several other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rested</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;ka&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
