His father, Jehoiada, was a priest, indicating Benaiah's noble lineage. The phrase "went up" suggests a deliberate and authoritative action, as Benaiah was executing a royal command. This reflects the transition of power from David to Solomon, where loyalty and justice were paramount.<p><b>struck down Joab</b><br>Joab, the commander of David's army, was a complex figure known for his military prowess and political maneuvering. Despite his service, Joab's actions, including the murders of Abner and Amasa, were seen as threats to the stability of Solomon's kingdom. Striking down Joab was a fulfillment of David's instructions to Solomon to deal with Joab's past transgressions, ensuring justice and the consolidation of Solomon's rule.<p><b>and killed him</b><br>The execution of Joab was a significant act of justice and retribution. Joab had sought asylum at the altar, a place of refuge, but his past crimes warranted this severe action. This reflects the biblical principle that justice must be served, even against those who seek sanctuary. It underscores the importance of righteousness and the consequences of sin, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of divine justice.<p><b>He was buried at his own home in the wilderness</b><br>Joab's burial in the wilderness, rather than in a place of honor, signifies his fall from grace and the consequences of his actions. The wilderness often symbolizes desolation and judgment in the Bible. This burial location contrasts with the honor typically given to military leaders, highlighting the disgrace associated with Joab's end. It serves as a reminder of the biblical theme that one's legacy is determined by their faithfulness and obedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benaiah_son_of_jehoiada.htm">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</a></b><br>A loyal and valiant warrior in King David's army, later serving as the commander of Solomon's army.
