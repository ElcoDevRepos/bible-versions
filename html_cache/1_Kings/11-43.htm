"Rested with his fathers" suggests a peaceful passing and continuity with his ancestors. It reflects the belief in an afterlife and the hope of being gathered with one's forebears. This phrase is used throughout the Old Testament to denote the death of the kings of Israel and Judah, emphasizing the continuity of the Davidic line despite human failings.<p><b>and was buried in the city of his father David.</b><br>Solomon was buried in Jerusalem, the city of David, which was the political and spiritual center of Israel. This burial location underscores the importance of Jerusalem as the city chosen by God for His temple and the seat of the Davidic dynasty. Archaeological evidence supports Jerusalem's significance during this period, though Solomon's specific burial site remains unidentified. The burial in the city of David also highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to David regarding his descendants.<p><b>And his son Rehoboam reigned in his place.</b><br>Rehoboam's succession marks the continuation of the Davidic line, a central theme in the biblical narrative. However, Rehoboam's reign is immediately marked by division, as the kingdom splits into Israel and Judah due to his harsh policies (1 Kings 12). This division fulfills the prophecy given to Solomon about the kingdom being torn from his son due to Solomon's idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>). Rehoboam's reign serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's commandments, contrasting with the ideal kingship that points to Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the First Temple in Jerusalem.
