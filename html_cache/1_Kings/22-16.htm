Ahab was the seventh king of Israel and is often remembered for his idolatry and marriage to Jezebel. The context of this passage is a council of war where Ahab and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, are deciding whether to go to battle against Ramoth-gilead. Ahab's character is often contrasted with that of Jehoshaphat, who sought the counsel of the LORD.<p><b>&#8220;How many times must I make you swear</b><br>This indicates a repeated interaction between Ahab and Micaiah, suggesting a history of tension and mistrust. In ancient Israel, oaths and swearing were serious matters, often invoking the name of God to affirm truthfulness. Ahab's frustration may stem from Micaiah's previous prophecies, which likely did not align with Ahab's desires or plans.<p><b>not to tell me anything but the truth</b><br>Ahab's demand for truth is ironic, given his history of ignoring prophetic warnings. This reflects a common biblical theme where leaders seek validation rather than genuine divine guidance. The truth in biblical terms is often associated with God's word and His prophets, contrasting with false prophets who tell leaders what they want to hear.<p><b>in the name of the LORD?&#8221;</b><br>Invoking the name of the LORD (Yahweh) signifies the seriousness and sacredness of the oath. In the Old Testament, the name of the LORD is associated with His covenant relationship with Israel and His authority. This phrase underscores the tension between Ahab's superficial desire for truth and his unwillingness to heed God's true message. The use of the divine name also highlights the spiritual conflict between the worship of Yahweh and the idolatry promoted by Ahab and Jezebel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahab.htm">King Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his idolatry and wickedness, who seeks counsel about going to war against Ramoth-gilead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/micaiah.htm">Micaiah</a></b><br>A prophet of the LORD who is known for speaking the truth, even when it is unpopular or dangerous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah, who allies with Ahab and insists on seeking the counsel of a true prophet of the LORD.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/ramoth-gilead.htm">Ramoth-gilead</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Gad, east of the Jordan River, which is the subject of the military campaign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>A group of prophets who falsely assure Ahab of victory, contrasting with Micaiah's truthful prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_truth.htm">The Importance of Truth</a></b><br>Micaiah's commitment to speaking the truth, even under pressure, underscores the importance of truth in our lives.

The setting is the threshing floor by the gate of Samaria, where Ahab of Israel and Jehoshaphat of Judah sit on thrones, weighing whether to attack Ramoth-gilead (<a href="/1_kings/22-10.htm">1 Kings 22:10</a>). Ahab has already heard 400 court prophets promise victory (22:6), yet he knows Micaiah alone has a track record of genuine revelation (22:8). His words here reveal:<p>&#8226; Ahab&#8217;s awareness that prophetic messages ought to come from God, not human flattery (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/18-21.htm">Deuteronomy 18:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; His frustration at Micaiah&#8217;s previous sarcasm&#8212;&#8220;Go up and triumph&#8221; (22:15)&#8212;which echoes Elijah&#8217;s taunt of Baal&#8217;s prophets (18:27).<p>&#8226; A conflict between political desire and divine authority, similar to Saul&#8217;s treatment of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How many times must I make you swear</b><p>Ahab treats truth as a commodity to be extracted by oath rather than embraced by faith.

Carmel&#8217;s proof of Yahweh&#8217;s supremacy (18:39).<p>&#8226; Like Balaam (<a href="/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18-19</a>), Ahab thinks extra insistence might bend God&#8217;s word to his preference.<p>&#8226; The tension between what leaders say they want and what they actually receive appears again with Zedekiah confronting Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/37-17.htm">Jeremiah 37:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the name of the LORD?</b><p>Invoking the covenant name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; adds solemn weight, underscoring that:<p>&#8226; True prophecy carries divine authority (<a href="/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Speaking falsely in that Name brings judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>; <a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Ahab&#8217;s appeal to the Name contrasts with his tolerance of Baal worship (<a href="/1_kings/16-32.htm">1 Kings 16:32-33</a>), highlighting hypocrisy&#8212;seeking God&#8217;s stamp without yielding to God&#8217;s reign.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/22-16.htm">1 Kings 22:16</a> unveils the tragic irony of King Ahab: he demands truth &#8220;in the name of the LORD&#8221; while his heart remains set against it. His repeated oaths expose a conscience that recognizes prophetic authority yet refuses submission. The verse challenges readers to examine whether we, like Ahab, ask for God&#8217;s word only when it aligns with our desires&#8212;or whether we receive it with obedient faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king said unto him How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord?</span> [Rawlinson concludes from these words that "this mocking manner was familiar to Micaiah, who had used it in some former dealing with the Israelite monarch." But we must remember that Ahab's words were really addressed to Jehoshaphat. He is so manifestly playing a part, that we need not assume that he is strictly truthful. His great desire evidently is to discredit Micah's predictions, which he clearly perceives, from the bitter and ironical tone of the latter, will be adverse to him.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/22-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
