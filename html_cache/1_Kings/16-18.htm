His reign was short-lived, lasting only seven days. The city referred to here is Tirzah, the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel at the time. The capture of the city by Omri, another military leader, signified the end of Zimri's brief rule. This event highlights the instability and frequent power struggles in the northern kingdom, contrasting with the more stable Davidic line in Judah.<p><b>he entered the citadel of the royal palace</b><br>The citadel was a fortified part of the palace, designed to be a last line of defense. Zimri's retreat to this stronghold indicates his desperation and the hopelessness of his situation. The royal palace in Tirzah would have been a significant structure, symbolizing the authority and power of the king. This act of retreating to the citadel shows Zimri's final attempt to hold onto power, even as it slipped away.<p><b>and burned it down upon himself</b><br>Zimri's decision to burn the palace down upon himself is a dramatic and tragic end, reflecting the chaos and moral decline in Israel during this period. This act of self-destruction can be seen as a form of suicide, which was rare and considered dishonorable in ancient Israelite culture. It underscores the desperation and lack of hope in Zimri's final moments. The destruction of the palace also symbolizes the end of his short-lived dynasty and the futility of his rebellion.<p><b>So he died</b><br>Zimri's death marks the conclusion of his failed attempt to establish himself as king. His demise serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of ambition and treachery. In the broader biblical narrative, Zimri's death is part of the ongoing judgment against the house of Jeroboam, as prophesied by Ahijah the Shilonite. It also foreshadows the eventual downfall of the northern kingdom due to its persistent idolatry and rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zimri.htm">Zimri</a></b><br>A military commander who became king of Israel by assassinating King Elah.

The episode warns that rebellion, however briefly successful, ends in ruin, while urging hearts today to seek refuge not in citadels of our own making but in the Lord who offers mercy to all who repent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">The palace of the king's house.</span>--The same phrase is found in <a href="/2_kings/15-25.htm" title="But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.">2Kings 15:25</a>. The word here rendered "palace" evidently means (as is clear from its derivation) "the high place," or "citadel," of the building. Some render it the "harem," with which the curious rendering (<span class= "greekheb">??????</span>) of the LXX.--signifying properly a cave or "lurking-place"--may perhaps, agree. But this is not suggested by the word itself. This desperate act of Zimri, which has many parallels in Eastern history, seems to indicate that there was held to be something especially treasonable, and therefore unpardonable, in his assassination of Elah. (See <a href="/1_kings/16-20.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he worked, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">1Kings 16:20</a>, and <a href="/2_kings/9-31.htm" title="And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?">2Kings 9:31</a>.)<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken</span> [the meaning is probably that which Josephus gives: "When he saw that the city had none to defend it," or possibly, "when he saw that a breach was made"], <span class="cmt_word">that he went into the palace</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> citadel, fortress, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5da;&#x5e2;&#x5d8;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5e2;&#x5ea;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>. So Gesen., Keil, Bight, <span class="accented">al</span>. The palace, no doubt, consisted of a string of buildings (<a href="/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-9</a>) of which this was the highest and strongest part. Ewald thinks that the harem - a word which has almost the same radicals ? or women's apartment, is meant - the <span class="accented">most secluded</span> portion of the great palace (Josephus understands it to mean "the inmost part"), and hence infers, as also from <a href="/2_kings/9-31.htm">2 Kings 9:31</a>, that the women of the palace had willingly submitted to the effeminate murderer of their lord, and that even the queen-mother had made advances towards him (vol. 4. p. 36). But, as Bight remarks there is nothing of this in the text, and Zimri's desperate act rather shows daring and contempt of death than effeminacy or sensuality. And <a href="/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/122-7.htm">Psalm 122:7</a>) seems to point to a stronghold rather than a seraglio] <span class="cmt_word">of the king's house, and burnt the king's house</span> [probably the palace which Jereboam had built. Ewald thinks it was this structure gave Tirzah its reputation for beauty; <a href="/songs/6-4.htm">Song of Solomon 6:4</a>] <span class="cmt_word">over him with fire</span> [According to the Syriac, the besiegers set fire to the palace. Similarly Jarchi. But the text is decisive. The parallel deed of Sardanapalus will occur to all readers. Rawlinson also refers to Herod. 1:176, and 7:107], <span class="cmt_word">and died.</span> [This word is intimately connected with the verse following. But there is no need to rearrange the verses. The text, as it stands, conveys clearly enough that Zimri's tragical death was a retribution for his sins.
