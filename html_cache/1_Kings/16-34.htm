Ahab, influenced by his wife Jezebel, promoted the worship of Baal, leading the nation further away from the worship of Yahweh. This period is characterized by spiritual apostasy and sets the stage for the events described.<p><b>Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho</b><br>Hiel is identified as being from Bethel, a city known for its association with idolatry, particularly after Jeroboam set up a golden calf there. The rebuilding of Jericho, a city that had been cursed by Joshua, signifies a blatant disregard for God's commands and a challenge to His authority. Jericho's strategic location made it a valuable city, but its reconstruction was an act of defiance against divine decree.<p><b>At the cost of Abiram his firstborn he laid its foundation</b><br>This phrase indicates the fulfillment of a curse pronounced by Joshua in <a href="/joshua/6-26.htm">Joshua 6:26</a>, where he declared that whoever rebuilt Jericho would do so at the cost of his firstborn. The death of Abiram as Hiel laid the foundation underscores the seriousness of God's word and the consequences of disobedience. It serves as a stark reminder of the cost of defying God's commands.<p><b>and at the cost of Segub his youngest he set up its gates</b><br>The death of Segub, Hiel's youngest son, as he completed the city's gates, further fulfills Joshua's curse. This tragic outcome highlights the completeness of God's judgment and the fulfillment of prophecy. It also serves as a warning to future generations about the dangers of ignoring God's warnings and the reality of divine retribution.<p><b>according to the word that the LORD had spoken through Joshua son of Nun</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and reliability of God's word as spoken through His servant Joshua. It connects the events of Hiel's time back to the conquest of Canaan, showing the continuity of God's promises and judgments. The fulfillment of Joshua's curse centuries later demonstrates the enduring nature of God's word and serves as a testament to His sovereignty and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel during whose reign Hiel rebuilt Jericho.

His firstborn dies when the foundation is laid, and his youngest dies when the gates are set in place&#8212;just as God had said centuries earlier. The verse stands as a sober testimony that ignoring God&#8217;s clear word invites real, painful consequences, while simultaneously underscoring the absolute reliability of every promise and warning spoken by the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Did Hiel . . . build Jericho.</span>--This marks both the growth of prosperity and power, and the neglect of the old curse of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/6-26.htm" title="And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that rises up and builds this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.">Joshua 6:26</a>). The place had not, it would appear, been entirely deserted.

But it was now made--what it continued to be even down to the time of Herod--an important place. Its natural advantages were great. It stood in a position well watered, and accordingly of great beauty and fruitfulness ("the city of palm trees"), and was, moreover, a city of military consequence, as commanding the pass from the valley of the Jordan to the high ground of Ai and Bethel. Having been assigned to Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-21.htm" title="Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,">Joshua 18:21</a>), it should have properly belonged to the kingdom of Judah. Its being rebuilt by a Bethelite, evidently under the patronage of Ahab, is one of the indications of a half-dependent condition of the Southern kingdom at this time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In his days did Hiel the Bethelite</span> [Observe the form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, and see note on 1 Kings 2:8. It is noticeable that it was reserved for a man of <span class="accented">Bethel</span> to commit this act of impiety. It was to such results the worship of the calves contributed] <span class="cmt_word">build</span> [<span class="accented">i.e., rebuild, fortify</span>, as in <a href="/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>; cf. <a href="/1_kings/9-17.htm">1 Kings 9:17</a>. It is clear from <a href="/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/10-5.htm">2 Samuel 10:5</a> that it had not been entirely uninhabited. But the Arab village was now converted into a town with gates and bars] <span class="cmt_word">Jericho</span> [We learn from <a href="/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21</a> that Jericho then belonged to Benjamin. It had evidently passed, however, at this date into the possession of Israel. It has been suggested that the transference took place in the reign of Baasha (Rawlinson). But it would seem that from the very first, parts of Benjamin (notably Bethel, <a href="/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13</a>) belonged to the northern kingdom. See Ewald, "Hist. Israel," 4:2, 3. It is not quite clear whether the rebuilding of Jericho is mentioned as a proof of the daring impiety of that age and of the utter contempt with which the warnings of the law were treated, or as showing the ignorance and consequent disregard of law which prevailed. But, on the whole, it seems to be implied that Hiel knew of the threatening of Joshua, and treated it with defiance. It has been suggested that the rebuilding had really been instigated by Ahab, and for his own purposes, hoping thereby to "secure to himself the passage across the Jordan" (Keil), but the text affords but slight warrant for this conjecture]: <span class="cmt_word">he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, at the cost of, in the life of, Abiram], <span class="cmt_word">and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the Lord</span> [<a href="/joshua/6-26.htm">Joshua 6:26</a>], <span class="cmt_word">which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.</span> [The exact fulfilment of the prophecy is mentioned, as showing that even in those dark and troublous times God did not leave Himself without witness, and that law could never be violated with impunity.] <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/16-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In [Ahab's] days,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1438;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
