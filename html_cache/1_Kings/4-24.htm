The Euphrates was a significant geographical boundary in the ancient Near East, often marking the limits of empires. Solomon's dominion over this area fulfilled the promise given to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, where God promised his descendants land from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates.
