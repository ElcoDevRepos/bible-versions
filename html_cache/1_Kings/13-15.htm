The term "man of God" is often used in the Old Testament to describe someone who is a spokesperson for God, such as Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>) or Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-18.htm">1 Kings 17:18</a>). This encounter highlights the tension between true and false prophecy, a recurring theme in the Bible. The old prophet's actions raise questions about his motives and the authenticity of his message.<p><b>Come home with me</b><br>The invitation to "come home" suggests hospitality, a significant cultural value in ancient Near Eastern societies. Hospitality was a way to show respect and build relationships, often involving sharing a meal. However, in this context, the invitation carries a deeper implication. The man of God had been explicitly instructed by God not to eat bread or drink water in Bethel (<a href="/1_kings/13-9.htm">1 Kings 13:9</a>). The old prophet's invitation tests the man of God's obedience to God's command, illustrating the challenges prophets faced in remaining faithful to their divine mission.<p><b>and eat some bread.</b><br>Bread, a staple food in ancient Israel, symbolizes sustenance and fellowship. Sharing a meal was a sign of peace and acceptance. However, the man of God's refusal to eat bread in Bethel was a symbolic act of rejecting the idolatry and false worship associated with Jeroboam's altar. This phrase also foreshadows the man of God's eventual downfall due to his disobedience. The narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of adhering to God's instructions, even when faced with seemingly benign temptations. This theme of obedience is echoed in other scriptures, such as the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>), where Jesus resists the devil's offers by adhering to God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophet_from_bethel.htm">The Prophet from Bethel</a></b><br>An old prophet living in Bethel who invites the man of God to his home.

here is the older prophet from Bethel who had just pursued the younger man of God from Judah (<a href="/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11&#8211;14</a>).<p>- Scripture presents him as a genuine prophet by office, yet, in this moment, his words do not come from the LORD. This reminds us that a title alone never guarantees current obedience (cf. <a href="/numbers/22-12.htm">Numbers 22:12, 20</a>&#8211;21; <a href="/1_kings/18-22.htm">1 Kings 18:22</a>).<p>- The narrative highlights personal responsibility: each servant of God must test every message against what God has previously and clearly spoken (<a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the man of God</b><p>- The younger messenger is repeatedly called &#8220;the man of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1, 4, 6, 11</a>), underscoring his divinely authorized mission.<p>- His earlier fidelity&#8212;denying King Jeroboam&#8217;s offer of hospitality in obedience to God&#8217;s direct command (vv. 7&#8211;9)&#8212;sets up the tension: will he remain steadfast?<p>- The phrase mirrors Moses&#8217; title (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-1.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>), urging the reader to see how high the stakes are when a representative of God faces subtle temptation rather than open hostility (cf. <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16&#8211;17</a>, where &#8220;the man of God&#8221; is called to be &#8220;fully equipped&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Come home with me</b><p>- Hospitality in ancient Israel typically signaled fellowship and endorsement (<a href="/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/luke/24-29.htm">Luke 24:29&#8211;30</a>).<p>- For the old prophet to invite him &#8220;home&#8221; means more than a meal; it is an appeal to relax the clear boundary God set: &#8220;You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/13-9.htm">1 Kings 13:9</a>).<p>- Temptation often approaches through what looks innocent, even pious (<a href="/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22&#8211;23</a>; <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29&#8211;30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and eat some bread.&#8221;</b><p>- Bread is ordinary, yet in this context it becomes the test of loyalty. God had said no eating or drinking in that place; any bread would be disobedience bread (cf. <a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>).<p>- The scene illustrates that a single act&#8212;however small&#8212;can either honor or dishonor the clear word of God (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>; <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>- Later, when the man of God accepts a similar invitation after hearing, &#8220;I too am a prophet,&#8221; divine judgment falls (<a href="/1_kings/13-18.htm">1 Kings 13:18&#8211;22</a>). The verse before us is the opening lure; it shows how compromise starts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/13-15.htm">1 Kings 13:15</a> records the old prophet&#8217;s seemingly harmless invitation, yet the verse exposes a spiritual crossroads. The young man of God carries a non-negotiable command from the LORD; the old prophet&#8217;s words, though spoken by someone with religious credibility, directly challenge that command. The lesson is straightforward: God&#8217;s prior revelation always outweighs any later, conflicting counsel, no matter who gives it. Fidelity to Scripture in the smallest detail guards us from deception and preserves our usefulness for the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he said unto him, Come home with me</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">Come with me to the house</span>] and eat bread.
