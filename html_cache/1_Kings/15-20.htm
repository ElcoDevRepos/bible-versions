This alliance was formed through a treaty, which Asa secured by sending treasures from the temple and his own palace (<a href="/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18-19</a>). This reflects the political maneuvering common in the ancient Near East, where smaller kingdoms often sought alliances with stronger powers to counterbalance threats. Asa's actions demonstrate a reliance on human alliances rather than solely on divine intervention, a recurring theme in the history of Israel and Judah.<p><b>and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel</b><br>The northern kingdom of Israel, under King Baasha, was a threat to Judah. By sending his commanders, Ben-hadad effectively shifted the balance of power. This military action highlights the constant state of conflict between the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The involvement of foreign powers like Aram in these conflicts was typical, as they sought to expand their influence and control over the region.<p><b>conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah</b><br>These cities were located in the northern part of the kingdom of Israel. Ijon and Dan were strategic locations, with Dan being one of the northernmost cities of Israel, often associated with the phrase "from Dan to Beersheba" to describe the entire land of Israel (<a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20:1</a>). Abel-beth-maacah was also a significant city, known for its wisdom and counsel (<a href="/2_samuel/20-14.htm">2 Samuel 20:14-22</a>). The conquest of these cities by Ben-hadad's forces weakened Israel's northern defenses and demonstrated the effectiveness of Asa's alliance.<p><b>and the whole land of Naphtali</b><br>Naphtali was one of the tribes of Israel, located in the northern region. The mention of the whole land of Naphtali being conquered indicates a significant loss for Israel, as this area was fertile and strategically important. The tribe of Naphtali is also mentioned in prophecies concerning the coming of the Messiah, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which is later referenced in <a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13-16</a>, highlighting the region's future significance in the ministry of Jesus Christ.<p><b>including the region of Chinnereth</b><br>Chinnereth, also known as the Sea of Galilee, was a vital area due to its fertile land and access to water. The region's conquest would have had economic and strategic implications for Israel. The Sea of Galilee later becomes significant in the New Testament as the site of many of Jesus' teachings and miracles, emphasizing its continued importance throughout biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) who formed an alliance with King Asa of Judah.
