His reign was relatively short, lasting only three years, which suggests a period of instability or challenges during his rule. Jerusalem, the capital city of Judah, was the political and spiritual center for the southern kingdom. The brevity of his reign contrasts with the longer reigns of other kings, indicating possible internal strife or external threats. Historically, this period was marked by ongoing conflict between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, as well as the influence of surrounding nations. The short reign may also reflect divine judgment or a lack of adherence to God's commandments, as seen in the broader narrative of the kings of Judah.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.</b><br>Maacah, the mother of Abijam, is identified as the daughter of Abishalom, which is another name for Absalom, the son of King David. This connection to David's lineage is significant, as it underscores the Davidic line's continuation in Judah's monarchy. Maacah's influence is noted in the biblical text, as she held a position of power as queen mother, a role that often carried significant political and religious influence. Her lineage from Absalom, who rebelled against his father David, may suggest a complex family dynamic and potential for political intrigue. The mention of her name highlights the importance of maternal lineage in the royal succession and the potential impact of her influence on Abijam's reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijam.htm">Abijam (Abijah)</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned for three years in Jerusalem.

Her idolatry shows the depth of compromise that filtered down to her son.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Abishalom&#8221; is another form of &#8220;Absalom,&#8221; David&#8217;s rebellious son (<a href="/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a>).

Mentioning Maacah, daughter of Absalom, exposes the ungodly influence surrounding Abijah and warns how parental patterns shape a nation&#8217;s spiritual temperature. Together these details call us to faithful obedience, confident that the Lord remains sovereign over both the length of kings and the legacy of families.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.</span>--The <span class= "ital">Abishalom</span> of this passage, called, in <a href="/2_chronicles/11-20.htm" title="And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.">2Chronicles 11:20</a>, <span class= "ital">Absalom</span>, is in all probability the rebel son of David, whose mother (<a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm" title="And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;">2Samuel 3:3</a>) was also named Maachah. In <a href="/context/2_chronicles/11-21.htm" title="And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and three score concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and three score daughters.)">2Chronicles 11:21-22</a>, it seems that of all the wives ("eighteen wives and threescore concubines") whom ?ehoboam, following the evil traditions of his father, took, she was the favourite, and that even in his lifetime Rehoboam exalted Abijam "to be ruler among his brethren." In <a href="/2_chronicles/13-2.htm" title="He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.">2Chronicles 13:2</a> she is called Michaiah, and said to be the daughter of "Uriel of Gibeah." This shows that, as indeed chronological considerations would suggest, she must have been the granddaughter of Absalom. She is mentioned below (<a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm" title="And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.">1Kings 15:13</a>) as prominent in the evil propensity to idolatry.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Three years</span> [The Alex.

The" three years" are not to be interpreted strictly. As he ascended the throne in the eighteenth and died in the twentieth year of Jeroboam's reign, he cannot have completed three years. But it does not follow that "he cannot have reigned much more than two years" (Rawlinson, and similarly Keil). He may have reigned all but three] <span class="cmt_word">reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah</span> [in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a> called <span class="accented">Michaiah</span>, Heb. <span class="accented">Michajahu</span>. That the same person is meant is proved as well by the context as by <a href="/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>, where the name is given as here. Keil (cf. Dict. Bib. 2:162) ascribes the discrepancy to an error of the copyist; but the names are so unlike in the original as to discountenance this assumption. I venture to suggest that <span class="accented">Michajahu</span> was the significant form - the word means "Who is like Jehovah?" - which the name Maachah, "oppression," borne by the Geshurite princess who married David (<a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>) assumed when she joined the <span class="accented">Lord's peo</span>ple, and embraced, as no doubt she would <span class="accented">do</span>, the religion of Jehovah. Such a change would be quite in accordance with the genius and traditions of the Semitic races (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5, 15</a>; <a href="/genesis/30.htm">Genesis 30</a>. <span class="accented">passim</span>; 32:28; 41:45; <a href="/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>, etc. Cf. <a href="/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>; <a href="/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4, 6</a>), and there may well have been special reasons in this case, apart from the piety of David, why it should be made. For the name Maachah appears to have been taken Iron the town and district of that name near Geshur - a part of Syria was called <span class="accented">Syria Maachah</span> (<a href="/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a>; cf. <a href="/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6-8</a>). In <a href="/2_samuel/20-14.htm">2 Samuel 20:14, 15</a> we read of a district of <span class="accented">Beth Maachah -</span> and it not improbably witnessed to unhappy memories. How natural it would be that David's bride should take a name of better omen and of a religious import, and how natural that the grand-daughter who bore her name should be called by that name in both its forms. Since writing the above, I find that a somewhat similar idea has occurred long since to others. Both Kimchi and Jarchi hold that she had two names. It is supposed by some that she assumed the name <span class="accented">Michaiah</span>, as more dignified, on becoming queen. Wordsworth thinks that Michaiah was her real name, and that it was degraded into Maachah when she was deposed for idolatry. This latter view dovetails with the one suggested above. It would be quite in accordance with Jewish usages and habits of thought that the name which had been changed into <span class="accented">Michaiah</span> when the grandmother became a proselyte, should be changed back into <span class="accented">Maachah</span> when this princess apostatized], <span class="cmt_word">the daughter</span> [rather, grand-daughter. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> includes all female descendants, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> (see ver. 10) all anxestresses] <span class="cmt_word">of Abishalom.</span> We can hardly doubt that Absalom, the son of David, is meant here.
