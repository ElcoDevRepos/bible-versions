The context is a confrontation between the prophet Elijah and the prophets of Baal, a Canaanite deity. Baal was often associated with storms and fertility, making the challenge particularly poignant as it involved fire from heaven. The phrase highlights the futility of idolatry, as these gods are powerless compared to the God of Israel. This moment underscores the biblical theme of the impotence of false gods, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, which describes idols as having mouths but not speaking.<p><b>and I will call on the name of the LORD.</b><br>Elijah's invocation of the LORD (Yahweh) emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The use of "LORD" in all capitals signifies the divine name Yahweh, the personal name of God revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>. This phrase underscores the exclusivity and supremacy of Yahweh over other deities. Elijah's confidence in calling upon the LORD reflects his faith in God's power and willingness to act on behalf of His people, a theme echoed throughout the Old Testament, such as in the deliverance narratives of Exodus.<p><b>The God who answers by fire, He is God.&#8221;</b><br>Fire is a recurring symbol of God's presence and power in the Bible. It represents divine judgment, purification, and the presence of God, as seen in the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) and the pillar of fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). The challenge to answer by fire is significant because it directly confronts Baal's supposed domain over storms and lightning. This phrase foreshadows the miraculous demonstration of God's power, affirming His sovereignty and the truth of Elijah's prophetic ministry. It also prefigures the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who baptizes with the Holy Spirit and fire (<a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>).<p><b>And all the people answered, &#8220;What you say is good.&#8221;</b><br>The people's response indicates their willingness to witness the contest and judge the outcome. This reflects the cultural context of ancient Israel, where public demonstrations and signs were often used to validate prophetic claims. The phrase suggests a moment of decision for the Israelites, who had been wavering between worshiping Yahweh and following Baal. It sets the stage for a dramatic revelation of God's power, intended to turn the hearts of the people back to Him, reminiscent of Joshua's challenge to choose whom they will serve (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of the LORD, Elijah is central to this account.

God&#8217;s fiery answer will declare His exclusive deity, expose false worship, and call the wavering people back to wholehearted allegiance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">And call ye on the name of your gods.</span>--This gift of a "sign from heaven"--not unfamiliar to Israelite experience (see <a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm" title="And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed on the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.">Leviticus 9:24</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-26.htm" title="And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire on the altar of burnt offering.">1Chronicles 21:26</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-1.htm" title="Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.">2Chronicles 7:1</a>)--which may not, as our Lord teaches us (<a href="/context/matthew/12-38.htm" title="Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from you.">Matthew 12:38-39</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/16-1.htm" title="The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven.">Matthew 16:1-4</a>), be craved for or demanded as a ground of faith, is, like all other miracles, granted unasked when it is seen by God's wisdom to be needed, in order to startle an ignorant and misguided people into serious attention to a message from heaven. In this instance the worship of Baal was a worship of the power of Nature, impersonated perhaps in the sun; and the miracle therefore entered (so to speak) on the visible sphere, especially usurped in his name, in order to claim it for the Lord Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And call ye on the name of your gods</span> [As Elijah is still addressing the people, not the prophets of Baal (see ver. 25), this change of person is significant.

Cf. ver. 39. Not only was a "sign from heaven" (<a href="/mark/8-11.htm">Mark 8:11</a>) ever esteemed a more powerful and direct proof of Divine energy - perhaps as being less liable to be counterfeited, and as excluding the idea of the operation of infernal powers (<a href="/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>) - but it must be remembered that Baal claimed to be the Sun god and Lord of the elements and forces of nature; while Jehovah bad already, according to the law, identified Himself with this token (<a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>). Indeed, this sign had a double fit. ness as a test of the true religion. It would not only put the <span class="accented">powers</span> of the rival deities to the proof; it would also at the same time decide which of the rival systems of worship was acceptable to the Supreme Being. It is observable that there is no mention of rain. We might have expected, after the long drought, that this would be the test. But that could not be promised until the Lord had first been recognized as God.] <span class="cmt_word">And all the people answered and said, Is well spoken.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">Good the word</span>. They accepted Elijah's proposition, but whether eagerly or reluctantly it is difficult to say. The Hebrew merely conveys that they admitted its fairness and reasonableness. Having gained the assent of the people, for whose verdict he and the Baal prophets were now contending, and who were, consequently, entitled to be consulted as to the sign which would satisfy them, he turns to the band of 400 prophets, who, probably in all the bravery of their sacrificial vestments (<a href="/2_kings/10-22.htm">2 Kings 10:22</a>), occupied a separate position on the hill top, between the king and the people, and repeats his proposal to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/18-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then you may call</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1462;&#1438;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;q&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7791;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
