Ahab was known for his idolatry and alliance with Jezebel, which led Israel into sin. Jehoshaphat, in contrast, was a king who sought to follow the ways of the Lord, though he made alliances that were sometimes questionable. This alliance between the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah was politically motivated, aiming to strengthen their military position against common enemies. The unity of these two kings, despite their differing spiritual paths, highlights the complex political landscape of the time.<p><b>went up to Ramoth-gilead</b><br>Ramoth-gilead was a strategically important city located east of the Jordan River in the territory of Gilead. It was a city of refuge and a Levitical city, indicating its religious significance. Historically, it was a contested site between Israel and Aram (Syria). The decision to go up to Ramoth-gilead was driven by Ahab's desire to reclaim it from the Arameans, as it was previously under Israelite control. This military campaign was significant as it demonstrated the ongoing conflict between Israel and Aram, and it set the stage for the fulfillment of prophetic words spoken by Micaiah, the prophet, regarding Ahab's fate. The journey "up" to Ramoth-gilead also reflects the geographical elevation of the region, which was common in biblical descriptions of travel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel (Ahab)</a></b><br>Ahab was the king of the northern kingdom of Israel, known for his idolatry and opposition to the prophets of Yahweh.

We can hardly doubt that Jehoshaphat at least would have been well content to abandon the expedition. After the solicitude he had manifested for the sanction of one of the prophets of Jehovah, and after that the one who had been consulted had predicted the defeat of the army, the king of Judah must have had re,my misgivings. But it is not difficult to understand why, notwithstanding his fears, he did not draw back. For, in the first place, he had committed himself to the war by the rash and positive promise of ver. 4. In the next place, he was Ahab's guest, and had been sumptuously entertained by him, and it would therefore require some moral courage to extricate himself from the toils in which he was entangled. Moreover he would have subjected himself to the imputation of cowardice had he deserted his ally because of a prophecy which threatened the latter with death. The people around him, again, including perhaps his own retinue, were possessed with the spirit of battle, and treated the prophecy of Micaiah with contempt, and it would be difficult for him to swim alone against the current. It is probable, too, that he discounted the portentous words of Micaiah on account of the long. standing quarrel between him and Ahab. And, finally, we must remember that his own interests were threatened by Syria, and he may well have feared trouble from that quarter in case this war were abandoned. Rawlinson suggests that he may have conceived a personal affection for Ahab; but <a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a> affords but slender ground for this conclusion.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/22-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1435;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Jehoshaphat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1445;&#1496;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
