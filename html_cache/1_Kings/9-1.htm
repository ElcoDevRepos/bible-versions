The construction of the temple took seven years (<a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>) and was a fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would build a house for God's name (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). The temple served as the central place of worship for the Israelites and housed the Ark of the Covenant. It symbolized God's presence among His people and was a place where sacrifices and offerings were made. The temple's completion also signifies a period of peace and prosperity under Solomon's reign, as God had granted him wisdom and wealth to accomplish this task.<p><b>and the royal palace</b><br>Solomon's royal palace, also known as the House of the Forest of Lebanon, took thirteen years to complete (<a href="/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a>). This palace complex included the king's residence, the Hall of Justice, and other administrative buildings. The construction of the palace alongside the temple highlights Solomon's dual role as both a spiritual and political leader. The palace's grandeur reflected Solomon's wealth and the stability of his kingdom. It also served as a symbol of the Davidic dynasty's enduring legacy, as God had promised David that his throne would be established forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<p><b>and had achieved all that he had desired to do</b><br>This phrase indicates that Solomon had accomplished his major building projects and other initiatives he set out to complete. Solomon's achievements extended beyond construction; he was known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive trade networks (<a href="/1_kings/10-23.htm">1 Kings 10:23-29</a>). His reign was marked by peace and prosperity, fulfilling God's promise to give Israel rest from their enemies (<a href="/1_kings/5-4.htm">1 Kings 5:4</a>). However, this phrase also foreshadows the potential for complacency and spiritual decline, as Solomon's later years were marred by idolatry and turning away from God (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4-6</a>). Solomon's accomplishments can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate builder of God's spiritual house, the Church (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>), and who perfectly fulfills all that He sets out to do (<a href="/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites, which Solomon built as a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_royal_palace.htm">The Royal Palace</a></b><br>Solomon's own residence, which he constructed alongside the Temple, showcasing his wealth and the prosperity of Israel during his reign.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, chosen by God as the place for His name to dwell, and the location of both the Temple and the royal palace.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_completion_of_building_projects.htm">The Completion of Building Projects</a></b><br>This event marks a significant achievement in Solomon's reign, symbolizing the fulfillment of God's promises to David and the establishment of a central place of worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_fulfillment.htm">Faithfulness in Fulfillment</a></b><br>Solomon's completion of the Temple and palace demonstrates God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises.

The work spanned seven full years, underscoring God&#8217;s faithfulness to the detailed instructions He had given David (1 Chron 28:11&#8211;19).<p>&#8226; Completion means every element&#8212;foundation to furnishings&#8212;was set in place (2 Chron 5:1). Israel now had a permanent, God-ordained center of worship, fulfilling the divine promise of <a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10&#8211;11</a> that the LORD would choose a dwelling &#8220;for His Name.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s faith-driven obedience shines. The text assumes a literal, historical temple that would later be filled with the LORD&#8217;s glory cloud (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10&#8211;11</a>), illustrating God&#8217;s willingness to dwell among His people in tangible form.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the royal palace</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and the royal palace&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1&#8211;12</a> describes this house.

Solomon&#8217;s authority was legitimate only as he remained submitted to the God whose temple stood beside his throne room (<a href="/psalms/72-1.htm">Psalm 72:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-12.htm">Proverbs 16:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The palace&#8217;s completion fulfilled God&#8217;s earlier promise to establish David&#8217;s line (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). It also provided a venue for royal justice (<a href="/1_kings/7-7.htm">1 Kings 7:7</a>), previewing the coming King whose reign will perfectly blend righteousness and peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and had achieved all that he had desired to do</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and had achieved all that he had desired to do,&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase gathers every royal project under one sweeping statement of success (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:4-9</a>).

The verse confirms literal fulfillment&#8212;promises made, promises kept.<p>&#8226; Yet the clause also sets the stage for God&#8217;s sober warning in the verses that follow (<a href="/1_kings/9-3.htm">1 Kings 9:3-9</a>). Material success can never replace covenant faithfulness. History soon proves that when Solomon&#8217;s desires drifted toward foreign wives and their gods (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-8</a>), the nation reaped division.<p>&#8226; Cross references such as <a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-14</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a> remind us that satisfaction in accomplishment must yield to steadfast dependence on the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1</a> marks a watershed: Solomon has finished the temple, erected his palace, and completed every ambitious project. The verse celebrates God&#8217;s tangible faithfulness and Solomon&#8217;s remarkable achievements, but it also prepares the reader for a crucial truth&#8212;the real measure of success is continued covenant loyalty. God fulfilled every promise literally; now He will call Solomon to live in grateful, obedient response.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">And it came to pass.</span>--The obvious <span class= "ital">prima facie </span>meaning of this verse would land us in much difficulty. By <a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm" title="And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.">1Kings 6:38</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-1.htm" title="But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.">1Kings 7:1</a>, we find that, while the Temple was built in seven years, the erection of the palace and the other buildings occupied thirteen years; and from <a href="/1_kings/5-10.htm" title="So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.">1Kings 5:10</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,">2Chronicles 8:1</a> it appears that these works were successive, and therefore that the completion of the palace could not have taken place till thirteen years after the completion of the Temple. Hence we should have to conclude, either that the dedication was postponed for thirteen years, till all the buildings were finished--which is in itself infinitely improbable, and contradicts the express declaration of Josephus--or that a similar period intervened between Solomon's prayer and the Divine answer to it, which is even more preposterous. The variation in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-11.htm" title="Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.">2Chronicles 7:11</a> probably suggests the true key to the difficulty: viz., that the notice in this verse is merely a summary of the history of 1 Kings 6-8, which records the whole of the building works of Solomon, and is not intended to fix the date of the vision of <a href="/context/1_kings/9-2.htm" title="That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.">1Kings 9:2-9</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord, and the king's house</span> [<a href="/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do</span> [By "desire" we are not to understand "pleasure buildings" (cf. vers. 10, 19). The chronicler gives the true meaning: "all that came into Solomon's heart." It is, however, somewhat doubtful what works are comprehended under this term. <a href="/2_chronicles/7-11.htm">2 Chronicles 7:11</a> limits it to the two great erections already described - "all that came into his heart to make <span class="accented">in</span> the house of the Lord and in his own house." But it is by no means certain that our author intended the word to be thus restricted; it is quite possible, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., that some of the buildings mentioned below (vers. 15-19) are to be included. But another question of much greater importance presents itself here. In the Divine communication of vers. 3-9 there is constant and unmistakeable reference to the prayer of dedication (see especially ver. 3); in fact, this message is the <span class="accented">answer</span> to that prayer. It has been held, consequently, that the answer must have followed, if not immediately, yet soon after the petitions were uttered; if so, the dedication must clearly have taken place, not on the completion of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>), but on the completion of the palace, etc.; in other words, the temple must have been finished fully thirteen years before it was consecrated and occupied. Rawlinson suggests that the delay was perhaps occasioned by the circumstance that the furniture of the temple was not till then ready; but <a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>, Hebrews, seems to state distinctly that <span class="accented">all</span> the vessels and appointments of the sanctuary were finished at the date there given. Reasons have been given elsewhere (see note on 1 Kings 8:1) in support of the position that the dedication possibly have been delayed for so long a period, especially after the strenuous efforts which had been made to hurry on the undertaking. Nor does the text, when carefully examined, really require this hypothesis; indeed, it suggests some reasons for thinking that a considerable period must have intervened between the prayer and the response. For the tone of this response is unmistakeably foreboding, if not minatory. Vers. 6-9 contain a stern warning. But there was nothing, so far as we know, in the attitude of Solomon or of Israel at the time of the dedication to call for any such denunciation. At that time, as the prayer surely proves, Solomon's heart was perfect with the Lord his God. But the response has unmistakeably the appearance of having been elicited by signs of defection. The wide difference, consequently, between the spirit of the prayer and the tone of the answer suggests that some time must have elapsed between them, and so far supports the view that the dedication was not delayed until the palace, etc., was completed. And it is also to be remembered that the prayer of dedication had not been without acknowledgment at the time. The excellent glory which filled and took possession of the house was itself a significant and sufficient response. No voice or vision could have said more plainly, "I have heard thy prayer, I have hallowed this house."
