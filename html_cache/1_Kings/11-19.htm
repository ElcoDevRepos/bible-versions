His favor with Pharaoh indicates a political alliance, as Egypt often provided refuge to foreign dignitaries. This reflects the complex political landscape of the ancient Near East, where Egypt was a significant power. The favor Hadad found suggests he was seen as valuable, possibly due to his royal lineage or potential to destabilize Israel, which was a common strategy among rival nations.<p><b>that he gave to him in marriage the sister of Queen Tahpenes, his own wife</b><br>Marriage alliances were common in the ancient world to secure political ties. By marrying the sister of Queen Tahpenes, Hadad was integrated into the Egyptian royal family, indicating a high level of trust and honor. This alliance would have strengthened Hadad's position and influence, potentially providing him with resources to challenge Solomon's rule. The mention of Queen Tahpenes highlights the importance of women in royal diplomacy, as they often played crucial roles in maintaining alliances.
