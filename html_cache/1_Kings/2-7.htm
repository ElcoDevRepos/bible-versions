His support for David during Absalom's rebellion is recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27-29</a>, where he provided sustenance for David and his men. This act of loyalty and kindness is significant in the cultural context of ancient Israel, where hospitality and allegiance were highly valued. The directive to show "loving devotion" reflects the Hebrew concept of "chesed," which encompasses loyalty, kindness, and covenant faithfulness. This phrase underscores the importance of honoring commitments and showing gratitude to those who have been faithful allies.<p><b>and let them be among those who eat at your table</b><br>Eating at the king's table was a sign of favor, honor, and close relationship. In the ancient Near Eastern context, sharing a meal signified trust and fellowship. This privilege was often reserved for family members and trusted advisors, indicating a special status. The inclusion of Barzillai's sons at the royal table symbolizes the continuation of the covenant relationship and the reward for their father's loyalty. This practice of rewarding loyalty can be seen in other biblical narratives, such as Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, who also ate at David's table (<a href="/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7-13</a>).<p><b>because they stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom</b><br>Absalom's rebellion against King David is a pivotal event in the history of Israel, detailed in <a href="/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15-18</a>. During this time, David fled Jerusalem to escape Absalom's forces, and Barzillai's support was crucial for David's survival and eventual return to power. The phrase "stood by me" highlights the loyalty and courage of Barzillai and his family during a time of crisis. This loyalty is contrasted with the betrayal of others, such as Ahithophel, who sided with Absalom. The narrative of Absalom's rebellion serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and the importance of faithfulness, themes that resonate throughout the biblical text.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is giving final instructions to his son Solomon before his death.

It also warns against forgetting benefactors once stability returns (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of Absalom reminds Solomon of the dangers of rebellion and the blessing of those who support God-ordained authority (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/2-7.htm">1 Kings 2:7</a> records David&#8217;s heartfelt directive to Solomon: honor the family that showed unwavering kindness when he was vulnerable.

Presence <span class="accented">at</span> the table is expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> (<a href="/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11, 12</a>). It was esteemed an essential part of royal munificence throughout the East that the king should feed a large number of retainers and dependants. Cf. the account of Solomon's daffy provision in <a href="/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22, 23</a>; also <a href="/2_samuel/19-28.htm">2 Samuel 19:28</a>; <a href="/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>]; <span class="cmt_word">for so</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in like manner, with <span class="accented">food</span>]; <span class="cmt_word">they came to me</span> [lit., "<span class="accented">came near."</span> The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> often includes, as here, the idea of succour. Cf. <a href="/psalms/69-19.htm">Psalm 69:19</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-57.htm">Lamentations 3:57</a>. Barzillai certainly came (<a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>), and probably Chimham, but the Speaker's Commentary is mistaken when it says that "Chimham is mentioned as present." He was present at the return of David (<a href="/2_samuel/19-31.htm">2 Samuel 19:31, 38</a>, but not necessarily before] <span class="cmt_word">when I fled because of</span> [lit., "from the face of "] <span class="cmt_word">Absalom</span> <span class="cmt_word">thy brother.</span> The mention of Absalom, and those terrible days of revolt and anarchy, when he was constrained to flee for his life, seems to have reminded the dying king of one of the bitterest ingredients of that bitter cup of shame and suffering - the cruel curses of Shimei. He remembers that the sin of Shimei, which was nothing else than treason and blasphemy, has so far escaped punishment. In a moment of generous enthusiasm, he had included Shimei in the general amnesty which he proclaimed on his return (<a href="/2_samuel/19-23.htm">2 Samuel 19:23</a>). He had thought, no doubt, at the time only of the offence against himself; he had forgotten his sacred and representative character as "the Lord's anointed;" or if he had remembered it (ver. 21) the emotions of that memorable day had obscured or perverted his sense of justice and duty. But he has since realized - and the thought weighs upon his conscience in the chamber of death - that he then pardoned what he had no power to pardon, viz., a sin to which the Mosaic law attached the penalty of death. For blasphemy, as for murder, there was no expiation short of the death of the blasphemer (<a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14-16</a>; cf. <a href="/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10, 13</a>); and blasphemy, like murder, though not perhaps to the same extent, involved those who heard it in its guilt, until they had discharged themselves of their sin upon the head of the guilty (<a href="/leviticus/14-14.htm">Leviticus 14:14</a>; cf. <a href="/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). But Shimei, so far from having suffered the penalty of the law, had been twice protected against it; twice preserved alive, in defiance of law, by the supreme magistrate, the executor of law. And David, who has been charging his son to keep the law, now realizes that he himself has been a law breaker. He has kept his oath, sworn to his own or his people's hurt, and he will keep it to the end. But Solomon is under no such obligation. <span class="accented">He</span> can demand the long arrears of justice, none the less due because of the time that has elapsed and the royal <span class="accented">laches</span> (<span class="accented">"nullum tempus occurrit regi"</span>); he can deal with the blasphemer as the law directs, and this David now charges him to do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But show</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;eh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">loving devotion</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1428;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;e&#183;se&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2617.htm">Strong's 2617: </a> </span><span class="str2">Kindness, piety, reproof, beauty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;li&#7687;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124;
