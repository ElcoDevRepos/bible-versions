It contained the stone tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and a pot of manna. The phrase "brought up" indicates the movement from the City of David to the newly constructed Temple in Jerusalem, signifying a transition from a temporary to a permanent dwelling place for God's presence. This act fulfilled the promise of a centralized place of worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-11</a>).<p><b>and the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God used by the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt. It was a precursor to the Temple and represented God's presence among His people. The transition from the Tabernacle to the Temple marks a significant shift in Israel's worship practices, from a nomadic to a settled form of worship.<p><b>with all its sacred furnishings</b><br>The sacred furnishings included items such as the altar of incense, the table for the showbread, and the golden lampstand. Each piece had specific instructions given by God (Exodus 25-30) and held symbolic meaning, pointing to aspects of worship and the coming Messiah. For example, the lampstand symbolized the light of God, fulfilled in Jesus as the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><b>So the priests and Levites carried them up</b><br>The priests and Levites were responsible for the care and transport of the Ark and the Tabernacle's furnishings, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/4.htm">Numbers 4</a>. Their role highlights the importance of holiness and reverence in handling sacred objects. This act of carrying the Ark and furnishings up to the Temple signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to establish a permanent place for His name (<a href="/1_kings/8-20.htm">1 Kings 8:20-21</a>).

As Israel carries these symbols &#8220;up,&#8221; we are reminded that the Lord who once traveled in a tent now reigns from His heavenly throne, inviting His people to draw near in reverence and joy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">The tabernacle of the congregation</span> (see <a href="/context/1_chronicles/16-39.htm" title="And Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,">1Chronicles 16:39-40</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/1-3.htm" title="So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.">2Chronicles 1:3</a>) was still at Gibeon; and the priests and Levites had hitherto been divided between it and the lesser tabernacle over the ark on Mount Zion. Probably each section of the priests and Levites now brought up in solemn procession the sacred things entrusted to them. According to the order of the Mosaic law (<a href="/context/numbers/3-25.htm" title="And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,">Numbers 3:25-37</a>), the Kohathites had charge on the march of the ark and the vessels, the Gershonites of the Tabernacle and its hangings, and the Merarites of the boards and pillars of the Tabernacle and the outer court. This order, no doubt, was followed, as far as possible, on this its last journey. What became of the Tabernacle and its furniture (so far as this was disused), we are not told; but all was probably deposited, as a sacred relic of antiquity, somewhere in the precincts of the Temple. This seems to be implied in the famous Jewish tradition (see <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/2-4.htm" title="It was also contained in the same writing, that the prophet, being warned of God, commanded the tabernacle and the ark to go with him, as he went forth into the mountain, where Moses climbed up, and saw the heritage of God.">2 Maccabees 2:4-6</a>), that Jeremiah was enabled to hide by miracle "the Tabernacle and the ark and the altar of incense" on the destruction of the Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they brought up the ark of the Lord</span> [which had now been for nearly 40 years "in the tabernacle that David had pitched for it" on the Mount Zion (<a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>) ], <span class="cmt_word">and the tabernacle of the congregation</span> [Heb, "the tabernacle of <span class="accented">meeting"</span> (<a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42, 46</a>.

The tabernacle of Mount Zion is never called "the tabernacle of the congregation" - indeed, it is expressly dis-tingnished from it, <a href="/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3, 4</a>.
