His decision to send Adoram, also known as Adoniram, reflects his attempt to assert authority over the northern tribes. Adoram's role as overseer of forced labor connects to the labor policies instituted by Solomon, which had become burdensome to the people (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-14</a>). This act of sending Adoram can be seen as a continuation of Solomon's policies, which were resented by the northern tribes, contributing to the division of the kingdom. The use of forced labor was common in ancient Near Eastern monarchies, often leading to social unrest.<p><b>but all Israel stoned him to death</b><br>The stoning of Adoram by "all Israel" signifies a collective rejection of Rehoboam's authority and the oppressive policies he represented. Stoning was a method of execution prescribed in the Mosaic Law for certain offenses (<a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>), symbolizing communal judgment. This violent act marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history, as it demonstrates the tribes' determination to break away from the Davidic monarchy's control. The stoning also fulfills the prophecy given to Jeroboam by Ahijah the Shilonite, indicating the division of the kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31-35</a>).<p><b>And King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste and escaped to Jerusalem</b><br>Rehoboam's hasty retreat to Jerusalem underscores the immediate threat to his reign and the seriousness of the rebellion. Jerusalem, the capital of the united kingdom and the city of David, served as a stronghold for Rehoboam. His escape highlights the vulnerability of his position and the loss of control over the northern tribes. This event marks the beginning of the divided monarchy, with Rehoboam ruling over Judah and Benjamin, while Jeroboam becomes king over the northern tribes. The division of the kingdom fulfills the prophecy of Ahijah and sets the stage for the subsequent history of Israel and Judah, with Jerusalem remaining the spiritual and political center for the southern kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_rehoboam.htm">King Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Judah, whose harsh policies led to the division of the united kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/adoram.htm">Adoram</a></b><br>An official in charge of forced labor under King Rehoboam.

The Adoram here mentioned must be identical with the officer of Solomon; but, though it is possible, it is not likely that he could have held office in David's time. Probably the name and office were hereditary<span class= "greekheb"></span>. The mission of Adoram shows that, too late, Renoboam desired to deal through him with the grievance of forced labour. But the sight of the man, who had been the taskmaster of their oppression, naturally stirred the multitude to a fresh burst of fury, venting itself in his murder, and perhaps threatening his master also, had he not fled hastily at once to Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute</span> [Probably the same officer as the Adoniram of ch. <a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>. For "Adoram," the LXX. and other versions read "Adoniram" here. It is curious that a person of the same name, Adoram (LXX. Adoniram), was over David's levy (<a href="/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>). That there was a relationship, and that the office had descended from father to son, can hardly be doubted, but whether two persons or three are indicated it is impossible to say. It is of course just possible, though hardly likely that one and the same person (Ewald) can have been superintendent of servile work under David, Solomon, and Rehoboam. It is generally assumed that the young king sent this officer "to treat with the rebels and to appease them, as Josephus expressly says" (Bahr). It seems quite as likely that he was sent to coerce them, or to collect the taxes, as a summary way of showing that the king meant to enforce his rights and was not moved by their words. For it is hardly probable that such a proud and headstrong prince as Rehoboam would stoop, especially after the confident threats which he had just uttered, to parley with rebels. Such a man, guided by such counsellors, and inflated with a sense of his own power and importance, would naturally think of force rather than of conciliation or concessions. He would be for trying his whips of scorpions. And if conciliation had been his object, it is hardly likely that he would have employed Adoram, the superintendent of the levy, a man who would naturally be obnoxious to the people, to effect it. Moreover the sequel - Adoram's tragical end - also favours the supposition that he was sent, not "to arrange some alleviation of their burdens" (Rawlinson), but to carry out the high-handed policy Of the king]; <span class="cmt_word">and all Israel stoned him with stones</span> ["With one exception, this was a bloodless revolution" (Stanley). It has been remarked that the practice of stoning is first heard of in the stony desert (Arabia <span class="accented">Petraea</span>). But in reality it is older than the date of the Exodus, as <a href="/exodus/8-26.htm">Exodus 8:26</a> shows. And it is an obvious and ready and summary way of despatching obnoxious persons (cf. <a href="/exodus/17-4.htm">Exodus 17:4</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-6.htm">1 Samuel 30:6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a>). It is to this day a favourite method of the East for testifying hatred and intolerance], <span class="cmt_word">that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed</span> [So the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. The Hebrew literally means, as margin, "<span class="accented">strengthened himeself</span>." But the A.V. gives the practical force of the word. He bestirred himself; he lost no time; the death of Adoram showed him the danger of a moment's delay. "He saw those stones were thrown at him in his Adoram" (Hall).] <span class="cmt_word">to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/12-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
