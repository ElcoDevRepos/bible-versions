It was strategically positioned on the trade route between Egypt and Mesopotamia, making it a valuable asset for any ruler. The rebuilding of Gezer by Solomon indicates his efforts to fortify and secure his kingdom's borders. Historically, Gezer was given to Solomon as a dowry by Pharaoh, king of Egypt, after he captured and burned it (<a href="/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>). This act of rebuilding reflects Solomon's political alliances and his commitment to strengthening Israel's defenses. The archaeological excavations at Gezer have uncovered Solomonic gates, which align with the biblical account of Solomon's extensive building projects.<p><b>Lower Beth-horon</b><br>Lower Beth-horon, along with Upper Beth-horon, was part of a strategic pass that connected the coastal plain with the hill country of Ephraim and Jerusalem. This route was crucial for military and trade purposes. The rebuilding of Lower Beth-horon by Solomon was part of his broader strategy to fortify key locations throughout his kingdom. This area had historical significance, as it was the site of Joshua's victory over the Amorites (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10-11</a>), where God intervened with hailstones and extended daylight. Solomon's construction efforts here demonstrate his wisdom in maintaining control over important military routes and ensuring the security of his kingdom. The fortification of Beth-horon also symbolizes the peace and prosperity during Solomon's reign, as he could focus on building rather than constant warfare.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.

That larger construction campaign is the backdrop for verse 17.<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;rebuilt&#8221; shows that Solomon did more than patch walls; he completely fortified and renewed select cities (<a href="/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/8-2.htm">2 Chronicles 8:2&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; These projects followed God&#8217;s approval of Solomon&#8217;s prayer and the promise that obedience would secure Israel&#8217;s future (<a href="/1_kings/9-3.htm">1 Kings 9:3&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; By investing royal resources, labor, and wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-16</a>), Solomon protected both worship in Jerusalem and the nation&#8217;s daily life.<p>&#8226; The verse therefore signals covenant faithfulness expressed through tangible, well-planned civic works&#8212;evidence that the king&#8217;s allegiance to God produced order and security for God&#8217;s people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gezer</b><p>&#8220;Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer, burned it, killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon&#8217;s wife&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Gezer sat on the coastal highway linking Egypt and the north (<a href="/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3, 10</a>). Controlling it meant guarding Israel&#8217;s western flank.<p>&#8226; Earlier, Israel failed to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants (<a href="/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>), but Solomon finally secured and integrated the city, fulfilling the original conquest mandate (<a href="/joshua/10-33.htm">Joshua 10:33</a>).<p>&#8226; By fortifying Gezer, Solomon honored the gift from his Egyptian ally while preventing pagan resurgence&#8212;a reminder that God&#8217;s people are called to complete what earlier generations left unfinished.<p>&#8226; The renovation also echoes David&#8217;s victory at nearby Baal-perazim and Gezer (<a href="/2_samuel/5-25.htm">2 Samuel 5:25</a>), showing a continuity of God-given triumphs across generations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lower Beth-horon</b><p>&#8220;The LORD routed them before Israel and struck them with a great hailstorm down to Azekah and Makkedah&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10&#8211;11</a>).

By reclaiming formerly pagan ground and reinforcing strategic passes, the king advanced Israel&#8217;s security, fulfilled unfinished conquest goals, and modeled diligent stewardship under God&#8217;s blessing. The verse assures believers that when leadership honors God&#8217;s Word, both worship and daily life are safeguarded, and past victories become enduring strongholds for future generations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Beth-horon the nether.</span>--The name "Beth-horon" ("the house of caves,") was given to two small towns or villages (still called <span class= "ital">Beit--r</span>), near Gezer, commanding the steep and rugged pass from the maritime plain, celebrated for three great victories of Israel--the great victory of Joshua (Joshua , 10), the victory of Judas Maccabaeus (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/3-13.htm" title="Now when Seron, a prince of the army of Syria, heard say that Judas had gathered unto him a multitude and company of the faithful to go out with him to war;">1 Maccabees 3:13-24</a>), and the last victory of the Jews over the Roman army of Cestius Gallus, before the fall of Jerusalem (Josephus, <span class= "ital">Wars of the Jews</span>, ii. 19).

Like Megiddo and Gezer, this town, too, lay on a high road, viz., that between Jerusalem and the sea coast. The selection of Beth-horon for fortification by Solomon is also justified by history - three decisive battles having been fought here (see <a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>; 1 Macc. 3:13-24, and Jos., Bell Jud. 2.19.8. The object of the king in fortifying this place was to protect the uplands of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim against invasion from the Philistine plain. It is perhaps not unnoteworthy that, according to our author, it was Beth-horon the <span class="accented">nether</span> that Solomon "built," as this would naturally have suffered more than its loftier neighbour from war.
