The temple was to be the central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The foundation signifies the establishment of a permanent dwelling place for God, replacing the portable tabernacle used during the wilderness wanderings. The temple's construction fulfills God's promise to David that his son would build a house for His name (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>).<p><b>was laid in the fourth year of Solomon&#8217;s reign</b><br>Solomon's reign is marked by peace and prosperity, allowing him to undertake such a monumental project. The fourth year indicates a period of preparation and planning before the actual construction began. This timing also reflects Solomon's commitment to fulfilling his father David's vision for the temple. The number four in biblical numerology often signifies completeness and universality, suggesting the temple's role in unifying the nation under God's covenant.<p><b>in the month of Ziv</b><br>Ziv is the second month of the ancient Hebrew calendar, corresponding to April-May in the Gregorian calendar. This timing is significant as it falls in the spring, a season associated with new beginnings and renewal. The choice of this month for laying the foundation may symbolize a new era for Israel, with the temple serving as a focal point for religious and national identity. The month of Ziv is also mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>, linking the start of the temple's construction to the Exodus, as it marks 480 years since the Israelites left Egypt, highlighting God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was tasked with building the temple, fulfilling the promise God made to David, his father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites and a symbol of God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_foundation.htm">The Foundation</a></b><br>The beginning phase of the temple's construction, signifying the start of a significant spiritual and national project.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fourth_year.htm">The Fourth Year</a></b><br>Indicates the timeline of Solomon's reign when the construction began, showing the importance of timing in God's plans.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_month_of_ziv.htm">The Month of Ziv</a></b><br>Corresponds to the second month of the Hebrew calendar, highlighting the historical and cultural context of the event.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_foundations.htm">The Importance of Foundations</a></b><br>Just as the temple's foundation was crucial, our spiritual lives require a strong foundation in Christ and His teachings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_timing.htm">God's Timing</a></b><br>The construction began in the fourth year, reminding us that God's plans unfold in His perfect timing, and we must trust His schedule.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_faithfulness.htm">Generational Faithfulness</a></b><br>Solomon's work on the temple was a continuation of David's vision, illustrating the importance of passing down faith and responsibilities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_temple.htm">Symbolism of the Temple</a></b><br>The temple as a dwelling place for God points to the New Testament truth that believers are now the temple of the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_god's_work.htm">Commitment to God's Work</a></b><br>The dedication to building the temple challenges us to commit to the work God has called us to, with diligence and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_6_37_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 6:37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_6_37_God_s_promise_kept.htm">How does 1 Kings 6:37 demonstrate God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_patience_from_temple_timeline.htm">What can we learn about patience from the temple's construction timeline in 1 Kings 6:37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Temple_s_year_ties_to_David_s_covenant.htm">How does the temple's foundation year connect to God's covenant with David?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_1_Kings_6_37_dedication.htm">In what ways can we apply the dedication seen in 1 Kings 6:37 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_6_37_Trust_God_s_timing.htm">How does 1 Kings 6:37 encourage us to trust God's perfect timing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Solomon_s_temple_foundation.htm">What is the significance of Solomon's temple foundation being laid in 1 Kings 6:37?

Just as a life must rest on Christ, the future temple had to rest on a solid, prepared footing.<p>&#8226; By highlighting the foundation, the text reminds every reader that genuine worship begins with what is hidden under the surface&#8212;true obedience and reverence rather than outward show (<a href="/psalms/11-3.htm">Psalm 11:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; This is not merely &#8220;Solomon&#8217;s temple&#8221; but &#8220;the house of the LORD.&#8221; Ownership and purpose belong to God, not to the king or the nation (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/2-5.htm">2 Chronicles 2:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling it &#8220;house&#8221; underscores God&#8217;s desire to dwell among His people (<a href="/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>; <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).
