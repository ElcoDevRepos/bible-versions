This question reflects his uncertainty and reliance on prophetic insight, a common practice in ancient Israel where kings often consulted prophets for divine direction. Ahab's inquiry shows his dependence on God's word, despite his previous idolatrous actions.<p><b>And the prophet replied, &#8220;This is what the LORD says:</b><br>The prophet serves as God's mouthpiece, delivering a direct message from the LORD. This phrase underscores the role of prophets in Israel as intermediaries between God and His people. It highlights the authority of God's word, which is central to the narrative and decision-making process in Israel's history.<p><b>&#8216;By the young officers of the district governors.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The young officers, likely inexperienced and not the usual choice for leading a battle, are chosen by God to demonstrate His power and sovereignty. This choice emphasizes that victory comes from the LORD, not human strength or conventional military strategy. It parallels other biblical instances where God uses the unlikely to achieve His purposes, such as David's victory over Goliath.<p><b>&#8220;Who will start the battle?&#8221; asked Ahab.</b><br>Ahab's question reveals his concern about leadership and responsibility in the upcoming conflict. It reflects a common theme in Scripture where leaders seek assurance of God's presence and guidance before engaging in battle. This question also indicates Ahab's hesitance and need for confirmation of God's plan.<p><b>&#8220;You will,&#8221; answered the prophet.</b><br>The prophet's response places the responsibility directly on Ahab, signifying that he must take an active role in God's plan. This directive challenges Ahab to trust in God's promise and act in faith. It serves as a reminder that while God orchestrates events, human participation and obedience are often required to fulfill His purposes. This interaction can be seen as a test of Ahab's faith and willingness to follow God's command.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his idolatry and marriage to Jezebel.

[The local governors (cf. <a href="/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>), on the approach of Ben hadad, had apparently fled to the capital. Whether these "young men" were their "pages" (Thenius), or even were "young lads" (Ewald) at all, or, on the contrary, a "select body of strong young men" (Bahr), the bodyguard of the various governors (<a href="/2_samuel/18-15.htm">2 Samuel 18:15</a>) (Von Gerlach), may be doubtful; but when Bahr says that Ahab would not have consented to appoint weak boys to lead the van, at least without remonstrance, he must have forgotten that <span class="accented">all</span> the ordinary means at Ahab's disposal were equally insufficient, and that in themselves 200 or 2000 tried veterans would have been just as inadequate a force as 200 pages. The agency by which the victory was won was purposely weak and feeble (<span class="accented">per turbam imbellem</span>), in order that the work might be seen to be of God (cf. <a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27, 29</a>). And this consideration makes against the supposition that the attacking body was composed of tried and skilful warriors.] <span class="cmt_word">Then he said, Who shall order</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">bind</span>; we speak of "<span class="accented">joining</span> battle"] <span class="cmt_word">the battle?</span> [The meaning is - not, "who shall command this force," but, "which side shall begin the fray?"] <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, Thou</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, thy band of young men shall make the attack.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/20-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;By whom?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
