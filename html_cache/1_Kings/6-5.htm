The temple was the central place of worship for Israel, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The inner sanctuary housed the Ark of the Covenant, representing God's covenant with Israel. The temple's design reflects the tabernacle's layout, which was given to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 25-27). The temple's walls were significant as they separated the holy from the common, a theme seen throughout Scripture, highlighting the holiness of God (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<p><b>Solomon built a chambered structure around the temple</b><br>Solomon's construction of a chambered structure around the temple demonstrates his commitment to fulfilling his father David's vision (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11-12</a>). These chambers likely served practical purposes, such as storage for temple treasures and offerings, and living quarters for priests. The architectural style reflects the grandeur and complexity of Solomon's reign, which was marked by peace and prosperity (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20-25</a>). This construction also signifies the transition from a nomadic worship system to a permanent, centralized place of worship, foreshadowing the eternal dwelling of God with His people (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<p><b>in which he constructed the side rooms</b><br>The side rooms were integral to the temple's function, providing space for various activities related to temple service. These rooms may have been used for storing sacred items, priestly garments, and other necessities for temple rituals. The detailed planning and execution of these rooms reflect Solomon's wisdom and organizational skills, gifts from God (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>). The side rooms' presence around the temple can be seen as a type of the church, which surrounds and supports the worship of God, with each member serving a unique role (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>). Solomon's temple, with its side rooms, prefigures the spiritual temple, the body of Christ, where believers are built together as a dwelling place for God (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem.

Round three sides of the Temple was built a kind of aisle, opening, however, outwards and not into the Temple, having three storeys of low chambers (each only five cubits high), so arranged that the beams of their roofs were supported on rests on the outside of the wall (each rest being a cubit wide), leaving the wall itself intact. Thus <span class= "ital">the </span>chambers of the lowest storey were narrowest--five cubits broad; the second storey six cubits, and the highest storey seven cubits broad. The higher storeys (see <a href="/1_kings/6-8.htm" title="The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.">1Kings 6:8</a>), in which the chambers no doubt opened into one another, were approached by a staircase, having an external entrance on the right side of the building; the chambers of the lowest storey probably had external doors of their own. Above the highest storey were still five cubits of wall, which would give room for the windows (like clerestory windows) previously mentioned. Nothing is said of the use of these chambers; but they would be, no doubt, for residence of the priests, stores for the Temple, and furniture.<p>The word rendered "chambers" in the former part of <a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm" title="And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:">1Kings 6:5</a> is a singular noun, signifying the whole of this aisle or side building; the "chambers" in the latter part of the verse--properly, "side pieces." or "ribs denote the separate apartments, or perhaps each of the storeys of the building.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And against</span> [or upon, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>; they rested on the wall] <span class="cmt_word">the wall of the house</span> [here meaning both temple and oracle: see below] <span class="cmt_word">he built chambers</span> [Marg. <span class="accented">floors</span>.

The design of the word is clearly to convey that the floors were <span class="accented">"divided</span> by partitions into distinct compartments" (Merz). According to <a href="/ezekiel/41-6.htm">Ezekiel 41:6</a> (where, however, the reading is doubtful) there were thirty-three of these side chambers; according to Josephus (Ant. 8:08. 2) thirty. Thenius is probably not so far wrong when he sees in these chambers <span class="accented">bedrooms.</span> A sort of monastery would seem to have been attached to the temple. So many chambers could hardly have been required for the "preservation of temple stores and utensils" (Keil), or of offerings (Ewald). Whatever their use, we can hardly suppose that they were wholly without light, though nothing is said about windows. They may have had "fixed lattices." It is to be re. membered that the priests and Levites ministered "by night in the house of the Lord" (<a href="/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>)] round about. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/6-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Against</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the walls</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7023.htm">Strong's 7023: </a> </span><span class="str2">A wall</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the temple</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;ba&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
