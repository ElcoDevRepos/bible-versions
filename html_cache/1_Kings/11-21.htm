Egypt, during this period, was a place of refuge for political exiles. The mention of Egypt highlights the historical ties and tensions between Israel and Egypt, a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>that David had rested with his fathers</b><br>This phrase indicates David's death, a common biblical euphemism for dying. David's reign was marked by military success and the establishment of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel. His death marked the end of an era and a potential shift in political dynamics, which Hadad saw as an opportunity.<p><b>and that Joab, the commander of the army, was dead</b><br>Joab was a formidable military leader under David, known for his strategic prowess and sometimes ruthless actions. His death, along with David's, signaled a weakening of the established order, creating a power vacuum that Hadad hoped to exploit. Joab's death is significant as it removed a key figure who had been instrumental in maintaining Israel's dominance.<p><b>he said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Let me go,</b><br>Hadad's request to Pharaoh indicates the diplomatic relations between Egypt and Edom. Pharaoh's willingness to host Hadad suggests a strategic alliance or at least a mutual interest in countering Israel's influence. This reflects the complex political landscape of the ancient Near East, where alliances were often fluid and opportunistic.<p><b>that I may return to my own country.&#8221;</b><br>Hadad's desire to return to Edom signifies his intent to reclaim his heritage and possibly lead a revolt against Solomon, David's successor. This reflects the ongoing enmity between Israel and Edom, rooted in the ancestral conflict between Jacob and Esau. Hadad's return can be seen as part of the broader narrative of opposition to Solomon's reign, which included other adversaries raised by God as a consequence of Solomon's disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hadad.htm">Hadad</a></b><br>A member of the Edomite royal family who fled to Egypt as a child when David's army conquered Edom.

Interpreting the news as God-given opportunity, he seeks Pharaoh&#8217;s blessing to return and oppose Solomon. The verse highlights God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty: while Solomon compromises with idols, the LORD raises an external adversary to chasten him. Leadership changes, alliances shift, but God&#8217;s Word stands certain, accomplishing exactly what He declares.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21, 22) <span class= "bld">When Hadad heard.</span>--If (as the text seems to suggest) this took place on the news of the death of David and of Joab, the scourge of Edom, it belongs, of course, to the early part of the reign of Solomon, before his power was established. The courteous evasion by the Pharaoh of that time of Hadad's request for permission to return, may probably indicate the beginning of the change of attitude towards the powerful monarchy of Israel, which took effect in the subsequent close alliance of the kingdoms. As the text stands, the record here stops abruptly, and then recurs to Hadad by a curious allusion in <a href="/1_kings/11-25.htm" title="And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.">1Kings 11:25</a>. It can hardly be doubted that there is some omission or dislocation of the text. The LXX. (in the Vatican MS.) introduces after the words "Hadad the Edomite" in <a href="/1_kings/11-14.htm" title="And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.">1Kings 11:14</a>, the words "and Rezon the son of Eliadah . . . all the days of Solomon" from <a href="/context/1_kings/11-23.htm" title="And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:">1Kings 11:23-25</a>; and then, resuming the story of Hadad, adds, after the record of his request to Pharaoh, "and Hadad returned to his land. This is the mischief which Hadad did, and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over <span class= "ital">Edom</span>." Josephus, on the other hand, says that at the time of the original request, Pharaoh refused permission; but that in the declining years of Solomon it was granted, and that Hadad, finding it impossible to excite rebellion in Edom, which was strongly garrisoned, joined Rezon in Syria, and with him established an independent power, and did mischief to Israel. (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii.</span> 6, 6.) This account is itself probable enough; it accounts, moreover, for the close connection in the history (especially in the LXX. reading) between Hadad and Rezon, and for the insertion of the whole matter in this place; and accords also with the fact that, while Syria seems at once to become independent after the death of Solomon, we hear of no revolt of Edom till the time of Jelioshaphat (2 Chronicles 20).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead</span> [It comes out very significantly here what a name of terror Joab's had been in Edom and how deep was the impression which his bloody vengeance of a quarter of a century before had made] <span class="cmt_word">Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">send me away</span>]<span class="accented">,<span class="cmt_word"></span> that I may go to mine own country.</span> [Rawlinson cites Herod. 3:132-137;
