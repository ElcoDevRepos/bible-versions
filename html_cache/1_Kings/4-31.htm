Solomon's wisdom is unparalleled, surpassing that of all other men, which is a testament to the divine favor upon him. This wisdom is not just intellectual but also practical, as seen in his governance and judicial decisions.<p><b>wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite,</b><br>Ethan the Ezrahite is mentioned in <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, which is attributed to him. He is considered a wise man, and his inclusion here underscores the high regard for his wisdom. The comparison to Ethan emphasizes Solomon's superior wisdom, as Ethan was likely a well-known figure of wisdom in Israel.<p><b>and wiser than Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol.</b><br>Heman is also mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19</a> as a musician and in <a href="/1_chronicles/25-5.htm">1 Chronicles 25:5</a> as a seer, indicating his multifaceted talents and wisdom. Calcol and Darda are less known, but their mention suggests they were recognized for their wisdom in their time. The "sons of Mahol" could imply a family or school of wisdom, indicating a tradition of learning and knowledge. Solomon's wisdom surpasses even these esteemed figures, highlighting his exceptional understanding.<p><b>And his fame spread throughout the surrounding nations.</b><br>Solomon's wisdom was not confined to Israel; it became known internationally. This widespread fame is significant in the ancient Near Eastern context, where wisdom was highly valued. Solomon's renown attracted leaders and scholars from other nations, as seen in the visit of the Queen of Sheba (<a href="/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10:1-13</a>).

It reminds us of the breadth of Solomon&#8217;s God-given insight, echoing declarations such as <a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29</a>, &#8220;God gave Solomon wisdom, exceedingly deep insight, and understanding beyond measure,&#8221; and foreshadowing the worldwide amazement seen later in <a href="/1_kings/10-24.htm">1 Kings 10:24</a>.<p>&#8226; Taken literally, the verse asserts that no contemporary or predecessor surpassed Solomon&#8217;s God-granted discernment&#8212;setting the standard by which all subsequent human wisdom is measured.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite</b><p>&#8226; Ethan appears in <a href="/bsb/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>&#8217;s superscription (&#8220;A maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite&#8221;), marking him as a recognized sage and worship leader.<p>&#8226; By naming Ethan, the text provides a real-life benchmark. If Israel&#8217;s worshiping community considered Ethan a model of wisdom, Solomon&#8217;s superiority over him magnifies God&#8217;s gift.<p>&#8226; This comparison recalls <a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>, which says Moses was unparalleled as a prophet. Just as Moses was unique in revelation, Solomon is unique in wisdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;and wiser than Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol</b><p>&#8226; Heman is likely the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a>, another respected figure in Israel&#8217;s heritage of wisdom and worship (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17, 19</a>).<p>&#8226; Calcol and Darda are less familiar, yet their inclusion signals that the nation recognized a circle of esteemed thinkers.

By comparing him to renowned sages Ethan, Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the verse highlights the unmatched scope of his God-given understanding. That wisdom radiated beyond Israel&#8217;s borders, drawing the nations&#8217; attention to the LORD and previewing the ultimate revelation of divine wisdom in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">He</span> <span class= "bld">was wiser.</span>--The wisdom of "Heman, Ethan, Chalcol, and Darda," then rivals of Solomon's fame, is now only known to us from this passage. In the genealogy of <a href="/1_chronicles/2-6.htm" title="And the sons of Zerah; Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara: five of them in all.">1Chronicles 2:6</a>, "Ethan, Heman, Chalcol, and Dara" (or "Darda") are found as sons of Zerah, the son of Judah; and the coincidence is remarkable enough to suggest identification. But this identification can scarcely hold. This passage evidently implies that these rivals of Solomon were contemporary with him, not belonging, therefore, to a family many generations earlier. Now it happens that we know of a Heman and an Ethan (see <a href="/1_chronicles/6-33.htm" title="And these are they that waited with their children. Of the sons of the Kohathites: Heman a singer, the son of Joel, the son of Shemuel,">1Chronicles 6:33</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-44.htm" title="And their brothers the sons of Merari stood on the left hand: Ethan the son of Kishi, the son of Abdi, the son of Malluch,">1Chronicles 6:44</a>) set by David over the service of song in the Tabernacle, and called "Ezrahites" in the titles of Psalms 88, 89 ascribed to them. Heman is, moreover, designated as "the king's seer in the words of the Lord" (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-5.htm" title="All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.">1Chronicles 25:5</a>); and his Psalm (Psalms 88) is singularly full of thought, moral speculation, and sense of mystery in life and death. Chalcol and Darda are described as sous of Machol. The word <span class= "ital">Machol </span>may be a proper name. But it is curious that it signifies "dance," or "music"; and it is at least possible that they also, like Heman and Ethan, may have been thus designated, as connected with the music of the Temple. However this may be, it can hardly be wrong, in spite of the repetition of the group of names, to refer this passage to this Heman and this Ethan, and hold Chalcol and Darda to be, like them, contemporaries with Solomon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (Heb. <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">he was wiser than all men</span> [Keil adds "of his time," but we have no right to restrict the words to his contemporaries (see note on chap. 3:12). It is very doubtful whether the names mentioned presently are those of contemporaries] <span class="cmt_word">than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda</span> [It is impossible to say whether these are the same persons as the Ethan and Heman and Chalcol and Dara of <a href="/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>, or the Ethan and Heman who were David's singers. The resemblance is certainly remarkable. Not only are the names practically the same (<span class="accented">Dara</span> may well be a clerical error: many MSS., together with the Syr. and Arab., read <span class="accented">Darda</span>), but they occur in the same order. Our first impression, consequently, is that the two lists represent the same persons, and if so, these four sages were the "sons" of Zerah, the son of Judah (<a href="/genesis/38-30.htm">Genesis 38:30</a>). But against this it is urged that Ethan is here called the Ezrahite, as are both Ethan and Heman in the titles of <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, and 88. respectively. The resemblance, however, of Ezrahite (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) to Zerahite (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) is so close as to suggest identity rather than difference. There is, perhaps, more weight in the objection that Chalcol and Darda are here distinctly said to be "the sons of Mahol," though here again it has been observed that Mahol (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>) means <span class="accented">pipe</span> or <span class="accented">dance</span>, and the "sons of Mahol," consequently, may merely be a synonym, agreeably to Eastern idiom (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:4</a>, with which cf. <a href="/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a>), for "musicians." We may therefore allow that the four names may be those of sons (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, descendants) of Zerah. But the question now presents itself: Are Ethan and Heman to be identified with the well known precentors of David? Against their identity are these facts: <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That Ethan the singer (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-31.htm">1 Chronicles 6:31</a>) is described as the son of Kishi (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-44.htm">1 Chronicles 6:44</a>), elsewhere called Kushaiah (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17</a>), and of the family of Merari; as a Levite that is, instead of a descendant of Judah, and that Heman, who is called the singer, or musician (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a>), and the "king's seer" (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-5.htm">1 Chronicles 25:5</a>) is said to be a son of Joel, a grandson of the prophet Samuel, and one of the Kohathite Levites (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17</a>). The first impression in this case, therefore, is that they <span class="accented">must be</span> distinct. But it should be remembered <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the sons - in the strict sense - of Zerah are nowhere else named for their wisdom, whereas the royal singer and seer probably owed their appointments to their genius, and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that though Levites, they may have been incorporated (possibly like Jair, through marriage - see note on ver. 13 above, and cf. <a href="/ezra/2-61.htm">Ezra 2:61</a>) into the tribe of Judah. The Levite in <a href="/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7</a> is spoken of as belonging to the family of Judah, because he dwelt in Bethlehem of Judah, and Elkanah the Levite is called an Ephraimite in <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>, because in his civil capacity he was incorporated into the tribe of Ephraim" (Keil). It must be admitted, however, that the <span class="accented">natural</span> interpretation of <a href="/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a> is that the "sons" of Zerah there mentioned were his immediate and actual descendants, and not Levites who long centuries afterwards were somehow incorporated into his family.
