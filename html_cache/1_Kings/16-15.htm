Asa's reign is noted for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11-15</a>. His reign provides a contrast to the instability and idolatry in the northern kingdom of Israel, where Zimri's brief rule occurs. Asa's long reign of 41 years (<a href="/1_kings/15-10.htm">1 Kings 15:10</a>) underscores the relative stability in Judah compared to the frequent changes in leadership in Israel.<p><b>Zimri reigned in Tirzah for seven days</b><br>Zimri's reign is one of the shortest in the history of the Israelite monarchy, highlighting the political instability and turmoil in the northern kingdom. Tirzah was the capital of Israel before Samaria, and its mention here indicates the centrality of this city in the political affairs of the time. Zimri's brief rule is a result of his coup against King Elah, as described in <a href="/1_kings/16-9.htm">1 Kings 16:9-10</a>, where he assassinated the king and took the throne. His short reign fulfills the prophecy against the house of Baasha (<a href="/1_kings/16-3.htm">1 Kings 16:3-4</a>), demonstrating the swift judgment of God against those who lead Israel into sin.<p><b>Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon of the Philistines</b><br>Gibbethon was a city originally allotted to the tribe of Dan (<a href="/joshua/19-44.htm">Joshua 19:44</a>) but was under Philistine control during this period. The mention of the troops encamped there indicates ongoing conflict between Israel and the Philistines, a recurring theme throughout the history of Israel. This military campaign against Gibbethon was significant enough to leave the army vulnerable to internal political upheaval, as seen in Zimri's seizing of power. The Philistines were a persistent threat to Israel, and their presence in Gibbethon underscores the external pressures faced by the northern kingdom, compounding its internal strife.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zimri.htm">Zimri</a></b><br>A commander in the army of Israel who conspired against and assassinated King Elah, becoming king himself for a brief period of seven days.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his long reign and efforts to reform Judah and bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tirzah.htm">Tirzah</a></b><br>The capital of the northern kingdom of Israel at this time, where Zimri reigned briefly.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibbethon.htm">Gibbethon</a></b><br>A city that belonged to the Philistines, where the Israelite troops were encamped during Zimri's short reign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A neighboring people often in conflict with Israel, representing a constant threat and challenge to Israel's security and faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sinful_ambition.htm">The Consequences of Sinful Ambition</a></b><br>Zimri's ambition led him to murder and seize power, but his reign was short-lived.

Asa&#8217;s long reign in Judah (<a href="/1_kings/15-9.htm">1 Kings 15:9&#8211;24</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1&#8211;13</a>) provided relative stability in the south while Israel in the north cycled through kings rapidly.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word presents history with precise time markers, underscoring that these events unfolded in real places and real years (<a href="/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast between Judah&#8217;s steady monarchy under Asa and Israel&#8217;s turbulence anticipates the judgment pronounced earlier on Jeroboam&#8217;s line (<a href="/1_kings/14-14.htm">1 Kings 14:14&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zimri reigned in Tirzah for seven days</b><p>&#8226; Zimri&#8217;s coup (<a href="/1_kings/16-9.htm">1 Kings 16:9&#8211;10</a>) and self-destruction (<a href="/1_kings/16-18.htm">1 Kings 16:18</a>) fulfilled the prophetic word against Baasha&#8217;s house (<a href="/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1&#8211;4, 12</a>).<p>&#8226; Seven days&#8212;barely a week&#8212;showcases the fragility of human power. Like the grass that &#8220;fades when the breath of the LORD blows on it&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7&#8211;8</a>), ungodly leadership cannot stand.<p>&#8226; Other brief reigns (e.g., Shallum&#8217;s one month in <a href="/2_kings/15-13.htm">2 Kings 15:13</a>) highlight a pattern: when a nation rejects God, its rulers come and go with alarming speed (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Tirzah, once a royal residence for Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/14-17.htm">1 Kings 14:17</a>), becomes the backdrop for divine judgment, reminding us that no fortress or capital city can shield sin from accountability (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon of the Philistines</b><p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s army was away besieging Gibbethon when Zimri struck, echoing Baasha&#8217;s earlier coup at the same city against Nadab (<a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27</a>).

Repeated conflict over the city exposes the lingering consequences of failing to drive out idolatry fully.<p>&#8226; While soldiers fought an external enemy, internal rebellion erupted at home, illustrating that security problems often begin in the heart before they appear on the battlefield (<a href="/james/4-1.htm">James 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Omri, the army&#8217;s commander, quickly turned from besieging Philistines to besieging Tirzah (<a href="/1_kings/16-16.htm">1 Kings 16:16&#8211;17</a>), showing how easily national focus shifts when leaders pursue ambition over righteousness (<a href="/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/16-15.htm">1 Kings 16:15</a> compresses a dramatic week into one verse: during Asa&#8217;s twenty-seventh year, Zimri&#8217;s seven-day reign in Tirzah unfolded while Israel&#8217;s troops camped at Gibbethon. The precision of Scripture highlights God&#8217;s sovereign oversight, the brevity of ungodly power, and the dangers of incomplete obedience. The verse challenges readers to trust the Lord&#8217;s timings, pursue faithful leadership, and guard against both external and internal threats to covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign</span> [The same word elsewhere translated in A.V. <span class="accented">began to reign</span>.

But when the narrative is examined, its probability and consistency become at once apparent. Stanley assumes that the siege lasted over the whole of this period, but it is more likely that when Baasha found himself king, he discovered that he had domestic matters enough upon his hands, without a foreign war, and so he raised the siege. It is very probable that he feared opposition such as Zimri and Omri subsequently experienced. And his wars with Asa and with Syria may well have prevented his renewing the undertaking. On the accession of Elah, however, with the usual ambition and impetuosity of youth, it was decided to recommence the siege and to win this city back for Israel. But the fate of Nadab, and the consequent ill omen attaching to the place would not be forgotten, and this, as well as his voluptuous habits, may have deterred the <span class="accented">faineant</span> Elah from besieging it in person, while the conspiracy which marked the former siege may at the same time have suggested to Zimri and others the thought of conspiring against Elah.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/16-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the twenty-seventh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#347;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6242.htm">Strong's 6242: </a> </span><span class="str2">Twenty, twentieth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1514;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#353;&#183;na&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
