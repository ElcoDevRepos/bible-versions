The verse assures worshipers that God is personally invested in the place&#8212;and the people&#8212;where He chooses to dwell, watching over them with unwavering attention and steadfast love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3-9) <span class= "bld">And the Lord said unto him.</span>--This vision of the Lord presents a remarkable contrast with that recorded in <a href="/context/1_kings/6-11.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,">1Kings 6:11-13</a>, while the Temple was in building. Then all was promise and encouragement; now, not only is warning mingled with promise, but, as in Solomon's own prayer, the sadder alternative seems in prophetic anticipation to overpower the brighter. In this there is (as has been often remarked) a striking exemplification of the austere and lofty candour of the inspired narrative, sternly contradicting that natural hopefulness in the hour of unexampled prosperity, which would have shrunk from even entertaining the idea that the blessing of God on the Temple should be frustrated, and the glory of Israel should pass away.<p>It is notable that, in its reference to the two parts of the promise to David, there is a subtle and instructive distinction. As for the Temple, now just built in fulfilment of that promise, it is declared without reserve that, in case of unfaithfulness in Israel, it shall be utterly destroyed, and become an astonishment and a proverb of reproach before the world. But in respect of the promise of the perpetuity of David's kingdom--the true Messianic prediction, which struck the key-note of all future prophecies--it is only said that Israel shall be "cut off from the land," and so "become a proverb and a byword" in captivity. Nothing is said to contradict the original declaration, that, even in case of sin, the mercy of God would chastise and not forsake the house of David (<a href="/context/2_samuel/7-13.htm" title="He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.">2Samuel 7:13-14</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/89-30.htm" title="If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;">Psalm 89:30-37</a>). So again and again in prophecy captivity is denounced as a penalty of Israel's sin; but the hope of restoration is always held out, and thus the belief in God's unchanging promise remains unshaken. The true idea is strikingly illustrated by the prophet Amos (<a href="/context/1_kings/9-9.htm" title="And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold on other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore has the LORD brought on them all this evil.">1Kings 9:9-11</a>): "I will sift the house of Israel, among all nations . . . yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth . . . I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof."<p>(3) <span class= "bld">To put my name there for ever.</span>--The meaning of the words "for ever" is determined by the prayer which they answer. They simply mark the Temple as the "settled habitation to abide in for ever" (see <a href="/1_kings/8-13.htm" title="I have surely built you an house to dwell in, a settled place for you to abide in for ever.">1Kings 8:13</a>), in contradistinction from the movable tabernacle. Whether they were to have a larger <span class= "ital">significance</span> is expressly declared to depend on the faithfulness of Israel (see <a href="/context/1_kings/9-7.htm" title="Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:">1Kings 9:7-8</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said unto him</span> [This message is given at greater length in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-12.htm">2 Chronicles 7:12-22</a>.
