Their reply is significant as it reflects the wisdom accumulated from years of experience under Solomon's reign. The elders' counsel contrasts with the advice given by Rehoboam's younger peers, highlighting the biblical theme of valuing wisdom and experience (<a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>).<p><b>If you will be a servant to these people</b><br>The concept of leadership as servanthood is a recurring biblical theme. Jesus exemplified this in His ministry, teaching that the greatest among His followers must be a servant (<a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>). This advice to Rehoboam underscores the importance of humility and service in leadership, a principle that is countercultural both in ancient times and today.<p><b>and serve them this day</b><br>The immediate action suggested here emphasizes the urgency and importance of addressing the people's grievances. In the historical context, the Israelites were burdened by heavy taxes and labor under Solomon's rule, particularly for his building projects (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-18</a>). The elders' advice suggests a shift in policy to alleviate these burdens.<p><b>and if you will respond by speaking kind words to them</b><br>The power of words is a significant biblical theme. <a href="/proverbs/15.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a> states, "A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger." The elders advise Rehoboam to use gentle and kind words to win the people's loyalty, reflecting the importance of communication in leadership.<p><b>they will be your servants forever</b><br>This promise of loyalty is conditional upon Rehoboam's response to the people's needs. The historical context shows that the kingdom was at a critical juncture, with tensions high after Solomon's reign. The elders' advice implies that a compassionate and servant-hearted approach could secure the unity and loyalty of the tribes, preventing the division that eventually occurred (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16-19</a>).

They understand both history and human nature, and their answer flows from that wisdom. <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a> reminds us, &#8220;Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.&#8221; Rehoboam has access to seasoned counselors who have seen God&#8217;s hand guide Israel through his father&#8217;s reign. Their opening words signal that what follows is not opinion but time-tested insight that aligns with the pattern God consistently blesses (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If you will be a servant to these people</b><p>Real authority in God&#8217;s kingdom begins with servant-hearted leadership. Jesus later echoes this principle when He says, &#8220;Whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43-45</a>). The elders urge Rehoboam to flip the expected power dynamic: instead of demanding service, he must provide it. Servant leadership reflects God&#8217;s own character (<a href="/psalms/113-5.htm">Psalm 113:5-8</a>) and nourishes unity because people willingly follow a shepherd who puts their welfare first (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and serve them this day</b><p>The counsel stresses urgency. It isn&#8217;t enough to intend service &#8220;someday&#8221;; the king must act immediately. &#8220;Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7-8</a>). Delaying obedience often breeds distrust. <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a> urges believers to &#8220;do good to everyone&#8221; while opportunities exist. A timely gesture of service&#8212;reducing taxes, easing heavy labor&#8212;would have demonstrated that Rehoboam valued the people more than the throne itself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and if you will respond by speaking kind words to them,</b><p>Tone matters. &#8220;A gentle answer turns away wrath&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>). The Israelites approach with grievances; harsh replies would only inflame them. The elders prescribe speech marked by kindness, respect, and empathy. <a href="/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a> says, &#8220;Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.&#8221; <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a> applies the same truth: &#8220;Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt.&#8221; A servant-leader&#8217;s words should convey understanding and hope, inviting cooperation rather than confrontation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they will be your servants forever.</b><p>When leaders model humility, timely action, and gracious speech, they earn lasting loyalty. David experienced this when his servants declared, &#8220;Whatever my lord the king decides, behold, we are your servants&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/15-15.htm">2 Samuel 15:15</a>). Loyalty cannot be coerced; it grows from love and trust. <a href="/proverbs/27-18.htm">Proverbs 27:18</a> teaches, &#8220;Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,&#8221; and tending a nation with servant leadership yields the fruit of enduring allegiance. Had Rehoboam heeded this advice, Israel&#8217;s unity would have been preserved (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a> details the tragic split that followed his refusal).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/12-7.htm">1 Kings 12:7</a> shows that God values leaders who serve rather than dominate, act promptly for the people&#8217;s good, and speak with kindness. Such leadership fosters deep, lasting loyalty. Rehoboam&#8217;s failure to embrace this wisdom tore the kingdom apart, underscoring the timeless truth: those who humble themselves to serve will, in God&#8217;s economy, be honored with faithful followers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">If thou wilt</span> <span class= "bld">be a servant.</span>--Both the policies suggested show how corrupt and cynical the government of Israel had become. For the advice of the old counsellors has no largeness of policy or depth of wisdom. It is simply the characteristic advice of experienced and crafty politicians--who had seen the gradual development of despotic power, and had still remembrance of the comparative freedom of earlier days--understanding at once the dangerous vehemence of popular excitement, and the facility with which it may be satisfied by temporary concessions, and perhaps desiring to defeat that private ambition, which was making use for its own purposes of the natural sense of grievance. It is to give "good words," and to be for the moment "a servant to the people," with, perhaps, the intention of abolishing certain excessive grievances, but by no means of yielding up substantial power. Whether it was in itself more than superficially prudent, would depend on the seriousness of the grievances, and the social and political condition of the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them</span> [Keil questions the propriety and expediency of this advice. He says, "The king could not become the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> of the people without prejudicing the authority entrusted to him by God." But they do not propose that he should become their servant, except for one clay, and then only in the sense of making reasonable concessions. What they mean is this: "If thou wilt brook for once to accede to their terms instead of dictating thine own," etc. The form of their answer was probably suggested by the temper of the king. They saw what was passing in his mind, viz., that he would fain play the autocrat, and that he resented it exceedingly that his subjects, just as he had begun to taste the sweets of royalty, should presume to parley with him; and they say in effect, "You think that they are reversing your relations, that they are making you, their sovereign, their servant. Be it so. It is but for one day. Then they will be your slaves forever"], and answer them [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, favourably; grant their request; cf. <a href="/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/65-6.htm">Psalm 65:6</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and speak good words to them, then will they be thy servants forever.</span> ["Thy servants," in opposition to "a servant" above;
