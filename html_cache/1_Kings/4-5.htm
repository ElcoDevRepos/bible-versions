Nathan here is likely the prophet who served during the reigns of David and Solomon, known for his role in confronting David about his sin with Bathsheba (<a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-15</a>) and supporting Solomon's claim to the throne (<a href="/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11-45</a>). Azariah's position "in charge of the governors" indicates a high level of authority, overseeing regional officials who managed various districts of Israel. This reflects the administrative organization of Solomon's kingdom, which was divided into twelve districts, each responsible for providing supplies for the king's household for one month of the year (<a href="/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>). This system ensured efficient governance and resource management, contributing to the prosperity and stability of Solomon's reign. The role of governors in ancient Israel can be compared to provincial leaders or satraps in other ancient Near Eastern empires, highlighting the influence of surrounding cultures on Israel's administrative practices.<p><b>Zabud son of Nathan was a priest and adviser to the king;</b><br>Zabud, also a son of Nathan, held dual roles as both a priest and an adviser to King Solomon. The name Zabud means "given" or "endowed," suggesting a person of significant standing and favor. His dual role is notable, as it combines religious and political responsibilities, reflecting the theocratic nature of Israel's monarchy, where spiritual and governmental duties often intersected. As a priest, Zabud would have been involved in religious rituals and maintaining the spiritual well-being of the nation. As an adviser, he would have provided counsel to Solomon, contributing to the king's renowned wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>). This combination of roles underscores the importance of spiritual guidance in leadership, a theme echoed throughout the Bible, where leaders are often depicted as needing divine wisdom to govern justly (<a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). The presence of Nathan's sons in such prominent positions suggests the enduring influence of Nathan's legacy and the trust Solomon placed in his family, reflecting the importance of loyalty and faithfulness in the king's inner circle.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah_son_of_nathan.htm">Azariah son of Nathan</a></b><br>Azariah is identified as the son of Nathan, a significant figure in King Solomon's administration.

The twelve district governors gathered provisions and maintained order; Azariah oversaw them all.<p>&#8226; The name &#8220;Nathan&#8221; likely points to the respected prophet who confronted David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1&#8211;14</a>). By elevating Nathan&#8217;s son, Solomon honors prophetic integrity and keeps a godly voice close to the center of power&#8212;an outworking of <a href="/deuteronomy/17-15.htm">Deuteronomy 17:15</a>, which calls a king to rule &#8220;whom the LORD your God chooses.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Putting one leader over many governors builds accountability. Scripture models this layered arrangement elsewhere:<p>&#8211; Moses appoints chiefs &#8220;of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens&#8221; under Jethro&#8217;s counsel (<a href="/exodus/18-17.htm">Exodus 18:17&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8211; David sets over-seers for treasuries and army divisions (<a href="/bsb/1_chronicles/27.htm">1 Chronicles 27</a>).<p>&#8226; Wise structure blesses the people. <a href="/proverbs/29-4.htm">Proverbs 29:4</a> notes, &#8220;By justice a king brings stability to the land,&#8221; and justice is harder to secure without clear lines of responsibility.<p>&#8226; Azariah&#8217;s role foreshadows good leadership practices in the New Testament church, where elders and deacons share duties so that &#8220;all things be done decently and in order&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zabud son of Nathan was a priest and adviser to the king</b><p>&#8226; Zabud combines two titles&#8212;priest and royal counselor&#8212;showing that Solomon valued spiritual guidance as much as administrative skill. The Berean Standard Bible renders the phrase, &#8220;Zabud son of Nathan was a priest and adviser to the king,&#8221; highlighting both callings in one man.<p>&#8226; Earlier kings leaned on godly friends: David had Hushai &#8220;the king&#8217;s friend&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-33.htm">1 Chronicles 27:33</a>) who offered counsel when Absalom rebelled (<a href="/2_samuel/17-5.htm">2 Samuel 17:5&#8211;14</a>). Solomon follows that pattern, anchoring his throne in spiritually grounded advice.<p>&#8226; A priest in the royal court keeps the monarch mindful of covenant responsibilities (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>). This safeguards against the drift that later ruined Solomon&#8217;s kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The pairing of governing and priestly roles points forward to Christ, the ultimate &#8220;King of kings&#8221; and &#8220;great High Priest&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>). While Solomon needed separate officers, Jesus perfectly unites both offices in His own person.<p>&#8226; Proverbs, many of which Solomon penned, stress the value of wise counsel: &#8220;Plans are established by counsel&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/20-18.htm">Proverbs 20:18</a>). Zabud embodies that truth for the throne.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a> records two sons of Nathan entrusted with key posts: Azariah supervising regional governors, and Zabud serving as priestly adviser. Together they reveal Solomon&#8217;s commitment to godly oversight&#8212;administrative order under spiritual guidance&#8212;showing how a king who fears the Lord weaves practical governance and faithful counsel into one sturdy fabric for the good of God&#8217;s people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Son of Nathan.</span>--Probably Nathan, son of David, and own brother of Solomon (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-5.htm" title="And these were born to him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel:">1Chronicles 3:5</a>), is here intended; for the title <span class= "ital">Cohen, </span>here given to Zabud, is expressly ascribed in <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.">2Samuel 8:18</a> to the "sons of David;" and Nathan the prophet always has his title, "the prophet," appended to his name wherever first mentioned in this book.
