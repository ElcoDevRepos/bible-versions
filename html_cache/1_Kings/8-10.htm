This moment follows the completion of the temple, a significant event in Israel's history, as it was the first permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant. The priests exiting the Holy Place indicates the completion of their duties in preparing the temple for God's presence. This act parallels the Day of Atonement rituals, where the high priest would enter the Holy of Holies, emphasizing the sacredness of the temple service.<p><b>the cloud filled the house of the LORD</b><br>The cloud represents the Shekinah glory, a visible manifestation of God's presence. This phenomenon recalls the cloud that led the Israelites through the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>) and the cloud that descended upon Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>). The filling of the temple with the cloud signifies God's approval and His dwelling among His people. It also fulfills the promise that God would dwell in the midst of Israel (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>). This event foreshadows the incarnation of Christ, where God dwells among humanity in a more personal and intimate way (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The cloud's presence in the temple underscores the holiness and majesty of God, reminding the Israelites of His sovereignty and the need for reverence in worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple for the LORD, fulfilling the vision and instructions given to his father, David.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The Levitical priests who were responsible for ministering in the temple and performing the sacrifices and rituals as prescribed by the Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_place.htm">The Holy Place</a></b><br>The inner sanctuary of the temple where the priests ministered, distinct from the Most Holy Place where the Ark of the Covenant was kept.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cloud.htm">The Cloud</a></b><br>A manifestation of God's presence, often associated with His glory and guidance, as seen in the wilderness with the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>The temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites and a symbol of God's dwelling among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_is_tangible.htm">God's Presence is Tangible</a></b><br>The cloud filling the temple signifies God's real and tangible presence among His people.

In the visions of Ezekiel the same glory is seen, first filling the house of the Lord, and then departing from it, as polluted by manifold idolatry (<a href="/ezekiel/10-4.htm" title="Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory.">Ezekiel 10:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm" title="Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.">Ezekiel 10:18</a>). Its return to the restored Temple is solemnly promised by Haggai (<a href="/haggai/2-7.htm" title="And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, said the LORD of hosts.">Haggai 2:7</a>; <a href="/haggai/2-9.htm" title="The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, said the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, said the LORD of hosts.">Haggai 2:9</a>) in distinct reference to the coming of the Messiah; and it is declared that it shall be even greater than in the magnificence of Solomon's Temple. The symbol clearly implies a revelation of Divine glory, as it is seen, not in the unveiled brightness of heaven, but in the glorious cloud of mystery; through which it must always be seen on earth, and which, indeed, is all that the eye of man can bear to contemplate. Out of that glory comes the only revelation which can be distinct to man--the voice or the word of the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only you heard a voice.">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when the priests were come out</span> [Rather, <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="accented">the priests came out</span>] of <span class="cmt_word">the holy place</span> [It has been supposed that "the holy" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) is here put for the <span class="accented">most</span> holy place, as in <a href="/ezekiel/41-23.htm">Ezekiel 41:23</a>.

It is hardly correct to identify the cloud with the Shechinah of the Targums (Rawlinson), for it is noticeable that the Targums never render "the cloud" or "the glory" by "the Shechinah." In fact, as regards the use of the word by Jewish writers, it would seem to be a periphrasis for God (Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1241).
