The invocation of the LORD's life is a common oath formula in the Old Testament, underscoring the seriousness of the statement (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>). It reflects the deep-seated belief in the living God who actively intervenes in human affairs. This phrase also highlights the continuity of God's covenantal presence, as seen throughout the history of Israel.<p><b>the One who established me,</b><br>Solomon acknowledges that his kingship is divinely ordained. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders (e.g., <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). The establishment of Solomon as king was not merely a political maneuver but a fulfillment of divine will, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5-7</a>, where David speaks of God's choice of Solomon.<p><b>who set me on the throne of my father David,</b><br>The reference to David's throne connects Solomon's reign to the Davidic Covenant, where God promised David that his descendants would rule Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This continuity is crucial for understanding the messianic expectations that develop later in the biblical narrative, as Jesus is often referred to as the "Son of David" (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><b>and who founded for me a dynasty as He promised&#8212;</b><br>This phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to David regarding a lasting dynasty. The Hebrew term for "dynasty" can also mean "house," indicating a stable and enduring lineage. This promise is central to the hope of a future Messiah, as it is believed that the Messiah would come from David's line (<a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1-10</a>).<p><b>surely Adonijah shall be put to death today!&#8221;</b><br>Adonijah's execution is a direct consequence of his attempt to usurp the throne, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5-10</a>. This act of justice is necessary to secure Solomon's reign and fulfill God's promise. The swift execution reflects the seriousness of rebellion against God's anointed king, a theme that resonates with the broader biblical narrative of divine justice and order. Solomon's actions here can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate judgment against rebellion and sin, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the newly anointed king of Israel.
