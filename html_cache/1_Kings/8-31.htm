The Mosaic Law provided guidelines for resolving disputes, emphasizing justice and reconciliation (Exodus 21-23). The concept of sinning against one's neighbor underscores the relational aspect of sin, which not only offends God but also harms community harmony. This reflects the broader biblical principle of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>), which Jesus later affirmed as a central commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>).<p><b>and is required to take an oath</b><br>Oaths were serious legal and religious commitments in ancient Israel. They were often used to affirm truthfulness or resolve disputes (<a href="/numbers/5-19.htm">Numbers 5:19-22</a>). The requirement to take an oath indicates a formal process of seeking justice, where the truth of the matter is solemnly declared before God. This practice highlights the importance of integrity and accountability, as breaking an oath was considered a grave sin (<a href="/leviticus/19-12.htm">Leviticus 19:12</a>).<p><b>and he comes to take an oath before Your altar</b><br>The altar in the temple was a sacred place where sacrifices and offerings were made to God. Coming before the altar to take an oath signifies seeking divine witness and judgment. This reflects the belief that God is the ultimate arbiter of truth and justice. The altar's centrality in the temple underscores its role as a place of atonement and reconciliation, pointing to the need for divine intervention in human affairs.<p><b>in this temple</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem, built by Solomon, was the focal point of Israelite worship and the dwelling place of God's presence (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). It served as the central location for religious and judicial matters, symbolizing God's covenant with Israel. The temple's significance is further emphasized by its role in mediating between God and His people, foreshadowing the ultimate mediation through Jesus Christ, who referred to Himself as the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem and is offering this prayer of dedication.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>A sacred place within the temple where sacrifices and oaths are made, representing a direct connection to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor.htm">Neighbor</a></b><br>Refers to fellow Israelites, emphasizing the community and relational aspect of the law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/oath.htm">Oath</a></b><br>A solemn promise or declaration, often invoking God as a witness to the truth of one's words.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin_and_oaths.htm">The Seriousness of Sin and Oaths</a></b><br>Sin against a neighbor is not just a personal matter but a community and spiritual issue.

Of these oaths, and the sophistical distinctions between the various forms of them, we have Our Lord's notice in <a href="/context/matthew/23-16.htm" title="Woe to you, you blind guides, which say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!">Matthew 23:16-22</a>. Such an oath has a twofold force--a force purely spiritual, inasmuch as it solemnly recognises the Presence of God, and by such recognition shames all falsehood as a kind of sacrilege; and a force which is "of the Law," inasmuch as the invocation of God's punishment in case of falsehood appeals to godly fear. Solomon prays that God will accept the oath under both aspects, and by His judgment distinguish between the innocent and the guilty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If any man trespass</span> [The force of the Hebrew (which begins somewhat abruptly) <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>) is probably, <span class="accented">As for that which, or in all cases in which, i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">when</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> Ewald, 333 a).
