The elders were likely experienced advisors who had served under Solomon, Rehoboam's father. Their counsel was rooted in wisdom and experience, reflecting the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, "Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety." This decision to reject their advice demonstrates a lack of humility and discernment, qualities that are essential for godly leadership. Historically, this rejection led to the division of the united kingdom of Israel, fulfilling the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah in <a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>.<p><b>instead, he consulted the young men</b><br>Rehoboam's choice to consult the young men highlights a generational divide and a preference for peers over seasoned wisdom. These young men, likely his contemporaries, lacked the experience and insight necessary for such a critical decision. This reflects a broader biblical theme where youthful arrogance and inexperience can lead to folly, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." The cultural context of the time placed great value on the wisdom of elders, making Rehoboam's decision even more striking and countercultural.<p><b>who had grown up with him</b><br>The phrase indicates that these young men shared Rehoboam's upbringing and social environment, suggesting they were influenced by the same royal court culture. This shared background may have led to a narrow perspective, lacking the broader understanding necessary for effective governance. The influence of one's upbringing and peers is a recurring biblical theme, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>, "Do not be deceived: 'Bad company ruins good morals.'" This choice reflects a failure to seek diverse counsel, which is often necessary for balanced decision-making.<p><b>and served him.</b><br>The young men who served Rehoboam were likely part of his inner circle, possibly holding positions of influence due to their proximity to the king. Their service to him might have been more about personal loyalty than objective counsel. This situation underscores the danger of surrounding oneself with advisors who prioritize personal allegiance over truth and wisdom. In contrast, Jesus Christ, as the ultimate King, surrounded Himself with disciples who were often challenged and corrected, demonstrating the value of truth over mere loyalty. This serves as a type of Christ's perfect leadership, which is characterized by wisdom, humility, and a willingness to listen to diverse voices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, whose decision-making is central to this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders.htm">Elders</a></b><br>Experienced advisors who served under Solomon and offered wise counsel to Rehoboam.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/y/young_men.htm">Young Men</a></b><br>Rehoboam's contemporaries who grew up with him and provided advice contrary to that of the elders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The united kingdom under Solomon, which faced division due to Rehoboam's decisions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>The place where Rehoboam went to be crowned king and where the events of this chapter unfold.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_wise_counsel.htm">The Value of Wise Counsel</a></b><br>Rehoboam's rejection of the elders' advice serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of seeking and valuing experienced and godly counsel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_peer_pressure.htm">The Danger of Peer Pressure</a></b><br>The influence of Rehoboam's peers highlights the potential pitfalls of succumbing to peer pressure, especially when it contradicts wise and godly advice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_poor_leadership_decisions.htm">Consequences of Poor Leadership Decisions</a></b><br>Rehoboam's decision led to the division of the kingdom, illustrating how poor leadership can have far-reaching and devastating consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_wisdom.htm">Seeking God's Wisdom</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to seek God's wisdom in decision-making, as human wisdom alone can be flawed and misleading.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_humility_in_leadership.htm">The Role of Humility in Leadership</a></b><br>Rehoboam's account underscores the need for humility in leadership, recognizing that leaders do not have all the answers and should be open to counsel.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_12_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 12:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Rehoboam_reject_elders_advice.htm">Why did Rehoboam reject "the advice that the elders had given him"?

Ignoring them meant spurning seasoned insight, much like Pharaoh dismissed Moses&#8217; warnings in <a href="/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1-3</a>.<p>&#8211; <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14 and 15</a>:22 remind us that safety and success flourish where many godly counselors speak.

The verse warns that rejecting seasoned, godly advice in favor of self-affirming voices invites division and loss&#8212;exactly what followed when ten tribes rebelled. Today, the Spirit still calls believers to weigh counsel by Scripture, honor the wisdom of the mature, and guard against the flattering chorus of unchecked peers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">counselled</span>] him ["We can easily imagine that their proposal was not very agreeable to the rash and imperious young king, in whose veins Ammonite blood flowed" (Bahr) ], <span class="cmt_word">and consulted with the young men</span> [see on ver. 1.
