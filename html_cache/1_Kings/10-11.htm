The wood of the "almug" tree, called (apparently more properly) the "algum" tree in <a href="/2_chronicles/9-10.htm" title="And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.">2Chronicles 9:10</a>, is (see Note on <a href="/1_kings/9-25.htm" title="And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the LORD, and he burnt incense on the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.">1Kings 9:25</a>) the red sandal-wood found in China and the Indian Archipelago, and still used for precious utensils in India. The "pillars for the house of the Lord" could not have been any of the larger supports of the Temple. They are usually supposed to have been (see margin) "rails" or "balustrades" for stairs. (See <a href="/2_chronicles/9-11.htm" title="And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.">2Chronicles 9:11</a>.) For the harps and the "psalteries" (which appear to have been like our guitars) the beauty and hardness of the word would be especially appropriate. These represent the stringed instruments chiefly in use in the service of the Temple. The harp (kinnor) is the more ancient, traced (see <a href="/genesis/4-21.htm" title="And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.">Genesis 4:21</a>) even to antediluvian times. The psaltery (nebel) is first mentioned (generally with the harp) in the Psalms.
