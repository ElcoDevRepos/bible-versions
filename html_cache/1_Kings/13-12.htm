The father here is the old prophet, who is inquiring about the direction taken by the man of God. This question reflects the urgency and determination of the old prophet to find the man of God. In biblical narratives, questions often serve to advance the plot and reveal character intentions. The old prophet's inquiry suggests a desire to engage with the man of God, possibly to test or challenge his prophetic message. This reflects a broader biblical theme where prophets often face opposition or scrutiny, as seen in the lives of Elijah and Jeremiah.<p><b>And his sons showed him the way taken by the man of God,</b><br>The sons of the old prophet play a crucial role in this narrative by providing the information needed to locate the man of God. This action sets the stage for the subsequent encounter between the old prophet and the man of God. The phrase highlights the importance of familial relationships and communication in biblical stories. The sons' knowledge of the man of God's path suggests they were either witnesses to his departure or had heard of his journey, indicating the man of God's actions were of public interest. This mirrors other biblical accounts where the actions of God's messengers are closely observed by the community, such as Jonah's mission to Nineveh.<p><b>who had come from Judah.</b><br>The man of God is identified as coming from Judah, emphasizing the division between the northern kingdom of Israel, where Bethel is located, and the southern kingdom of Judah. This geographical detail is significant, as it underscores the political and religious tensions of the time. The division of the kingdom after Solomon's reign led to differing religious practices, with Jeroboam establishing alternative worship centers in Bethel and Dan. The man of God's origin from Judah aligns him with the Davidic line and the Jerusalem temple, contrasting with the idolatrous practices in Bethel. This distinction foreshadows the conflict between true worship and idolatry, a recurring theme in the prophetic literature. The man of God from Judah can be seen as a type of Christ, who also came from Judah and confronted false religious practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_old_prophet.htm">The Old Prophet</a></b><br>An older prophet living in Bethel who seeks out the man of God from Judah.

Scripture often uses physical movement to highlight moral or spiritual paths (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13&#8211;14</a>). By asking for the exact road, the prophet signals he intends a face-to-face meeting&#8212;one that will test the man of God&#8217;s obedience to the Lord&#8217;s earlier command not to eat or drink in Bethel (<a href="/1_kings/13-8.htm">1 Kings 13:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their father asked</b><p>The speaker is not a random inquirer; he is &#8220;their father,&#8221; a seasoned prophet whose authority and curiosity drive the scene. Fathers in Israel were charged to instruct their households in God&#8217;s ways (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>), yet here the father&#8217;s intention is mixed. He represents religious influence that can either guide or mislead (cf. Eli&#8217;s sons in <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12</a>). His question shows how spiritual leadership can become compromised when divine revelation is treated casually.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his sons showed him the way</b><p>The sons had watched the earlier encounter between Jeroboam and the man of God (<a href="/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11</a>). They become eyewitnesses, passing information to their father.<p>&#8226; Their quick response reveals familial loyalty, but it also demonstrates how easily bystanders can aid a misguided mission.<p>&#8226; Their report underscores a biblical principle: testimony spreads quickly and can influence decisions for good or ill (<a href="/proverbs/18-8.htm">Proverbs 18:8</a>; <a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>).<p>&#8226; By cooperating, the sons inadvertently propel events that will expose the man of God&#8217;s vulnerability to deceptive counsel (vv. 18-19).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>taken by the man of God</b><p>The phrase points back to the prophet&#8217;s earlier obedience. He had followed God&#8217;s specific travel route, refusing King Jeroboam&#8217;s hospitality (<a href="/1_kings/13-7.htm">1 Kings 13:7-10</a>). His path symbolized unwavering commitment to God&#8217;s word (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>). Yet it also sets the stage for a looming test: will he keep following God&#8217;s directive once a fellow prophet urges a detour? The verse reminds us that past obedience does not guarantee future faithfulness (<a href="/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who had come from Judah</b><p>The man of God is an outsider in the northern kingdom, sent from Judah to confront Bethel&#8217;s altar and Jeroboam&#8217;s idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1-2</a>; cf. <a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15-18</a>, where his prophecy is later fulfilled).<p>&#8226; His southern origin highlights Israel&#8217;s divided kingdom and the Lord&#8217;s ongoing concern for the north despite its rebellion.<p>&#8226; It underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty: He can raise a messenger from anywhere to challenge sin (<a href="/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail also intensifies the upcoming conflict&#8212;two prophets, both claiming divine authority, but only one truly aligned with God&#8217;s word (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/13-12.htm">1 Kings 13:12</a> captures a pivotal moment: an anxious prophet seeks the exact route of God&#8217;s messenger, relying on his sons&#8217; eyewitness account. The verse emphasizes how quickly information&#8212;and influence&#8212;travels, how spiritual leadership can drift, and how even faithful servants remain vulnerable when they deviate from God&#8217;s explicit commands. It sets the stage for a sobering lesson: staying on God&#8217;s path requires continual discernment and uncompromising adherence to His revealed word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And their father said unto them, What way went he?</span> [The question shows that the old prophet throughly understood the import of those "words," and that his first thought was that the interdict must be removed at any cost.] <span class="cmt_word">For his sons had seen</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and his sons saw</span>, or <span class="accented">showed</span>.
