His reply here is part of a strategic move following his failed bid for kingship. In the context of ancient Near Eastern customs, the request he is about to make carries significant political implications.<p><b>Please speak to King Solomon</b><br>Adonijah approaches Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, to intercede on his behalf. This reflects the cultural practice of using influential intermediaries to make requests to a king. Bathsheba's position as the queen mother gives her a unique status and influence in the royal court, which Adonijah hopes to leverage.<p><b>since he will not turn you down</b><br>Adonijah assumes that Solomon will honor a request made by his mother, Bathsheba. This assumption is based on the respect and authority typically afforded to the queen mother in the royal hierarchy. It also reflects Adonijah's understanding of familial dynamics and the potential influence Bathsheba holds over Solomon.<p><b>Let him give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife</b><br>Abishag was a young woman who served King David in his old age, providing him with warmth and care. Although she was not David's wife, her association with the king gives her a status that could be seen as a claim to the throne. In the ancient Near East, taking a former king's concubine or attendant could be interpreted as a claim to his throne. Adonijah's request is thus politically charged, as marrying Abishag could be seen as an attempt to legitimize his previous claim to kingship. This request is reminiscent of Absalom's actions in <a href="/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21-22</a>, where he took his father David's concubines to assert his claim to the throne.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The son of King David who previously attempted to claim the throne before Solomon was anointed king.

Like Absalom before him, he masks ambition beneath polite words (<a href="/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative reminds us that the human heart, apart from God&#8217;s transforming grace, clings to self-exaltation (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Please speak to King Solomon</b><p>Bathsheba, as queen mother, enjoys unique access to the throne (<a href="/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226;

He misreads Solomon&#8217;s discernment (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>) and underestimates the king&#8217;s awareness of political threats.<p>&#8226; Pretending innocence, he couches his bid as a simple favor, echoing how Satan presents temptation as harmless (<a href="/genesis/3-4.htm">Genesis 3:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let him give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife</b><p>Abishag was David&#8217;s final attendant and, by custom, part of the royal household (<a href="/1_kings/1-3.htm">1 Kings 1:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226;

Solomon will recognize the hidden agenda and act decisively, protecting the God-ordained succession. <a href="/1_kings/2-17.htm">1 Kings 2:17</a> thus serves as a sober lesson on the persistence of prideful ambition and the need for godly discernment in leadership.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the ring; for he will not say thee nay,</span> [will not repulse thee.
