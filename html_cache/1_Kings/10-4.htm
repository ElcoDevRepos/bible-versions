Sheba is generally identified with the region of modern-day Yemen, known for its wealth and trade. The queen's journey underscores the international recognition of Solomon's wisdom, which was a gift from God (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>). This wisdom is not merely intellectual but encompasses governance, justice, and understanding of the natural world (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>). The visit fulfills the promise that Solomon's wisdom would be renowned (<a href="/1_kings/4-31.htm">1 Kings 4:31</a>). The queen's recognition of Solomon's wisdom prefigures the Gentiles' acknowledgment of Christ's wisdom, as Jesus refers to this event in <a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>, indicating that He is greater than Solomon.<p><b>the palace he had built</b><br>Solomon's palace, part of a larger complex that included the Temple, was a symbol of his wealth, power, and the stability of his reign. The construction of the palace took thirteen years (<a href="/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a>), reflecting its grandeur and the resources available to Solomon. The palace's architecture and opulence would have been impressive to foreign dignitaries, showcasing the prosperity and divine favor upon Israel during Solomon's reign. This palace, along with the Temple, represented the zenith of Israel's united monarchy and foreshadowed the eternal kingdom of Christ, who is building a spiritual house (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). Solomon's palace also serves as a reminder of the temporary nature of earthly kingdoms, as it was later destroyed, pointing to the eternal kingdom established by Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/q/queen_of_sheba.htm">Queen of Sheba</a></b><br>A monarch from the region of Sheba, often associated with the area of modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia.

The queen had heard reports about Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>), yet hearing could never equal seeing. When she finally &#8220;saw,&#8221; the testimony became undeniable (<a href="/2_chronicles/9-6.htm">2 Chronicles 9:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Her long, costly journey from the Arabian peninsula underlines the worth she placed on firsthand truth. Jesus later highlights her diligence as a rebuke to spiritual complacency (<a href="/luke/11-31.htm">Luke 11:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly stresses the value of personal encounter with what God has done (<a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>; <a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>), reminding us that faith is strengthened when we step out to &#8220;come and see.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the wisdom of Solomon</b><p>&#8226; What she witnessed was not mere intelligence but God-given wisdom promised in <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a> and showcased in Solomon&#8217;s breadth of understanding (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>).<p>&#8226; Wisdom was visible in:<p>&#8211; Just decisions (<a href="/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16-28</a>)<p>&#8211; Skillful administration (<a href="/1_kings/4-1.htm">1 Kings 4:1-19</a>)<p>&#8211; Inspired writing&#8212;Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs (<a href="/1_kings/4-32.htm">1 Kings 4:32</a>)<p>&#8226; The queen&#8217;s reaction anticipates <a href="/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>, where wisdom &#8220;from above&#8221; is recognized by its pure, peace-loving fruit.<p>&#8226; Her amazement also foreshadows the greater wisdom of Christ (<a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>), inviting us to treasure the One &#8220;greater than Solomon.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the palace he had built</b><p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s residence took thirteen years to complete (<a href="/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a>).

Buildings, furnishings, and court organization all proclaimed God&#8217;s order and blessing.<p>&#8226; While the palace impressed, Solomon himself pointed beyond it to the LORD who established the throne (<a href="/2_chronicles/9-8.htm">2 Chronicles 9:8</a>). In the same way, every earthly blessing is meant to direct hearts to the Giver (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/10-4.htm">1 Kings 10:4</a> records a threefold revelation: a seeker&#8217;s open eyes, the God-given wisdom of Israel&#8217;s king, and the tangible splendor that wisdom produces. Together they demonstrate that when God&#8217;s gifts are fully embraced, outsiders glimpse His glory and are moved to acknowledge Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4, 5) <span class= "bld">And when the queen of Sheba had seen.</span>--There is something curiously inartificial and true to nature in the accumulation of different impressions as made upon the imagination of the queen. First of all comes the primary impression of Solomon's wisdom, known by his answering all her questions, and "seen" in the various ordinances of his court and his government. Then the magnificence of the palace and all the arrangements of its service are referred to in detail, as especially likely to tell on one whose own splendour was probably of a simpler and more barbaric sort. Lastly, if our translation be correct, the record singles out the ascent or viaduct crossing the valley from the palace to Mount Moriah, and forming the royal entrance into the Temple (see <a href="/1_chronicles/26-16.htm" title="To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward.">1Chronicles 26:16</a>;<a href="/2_kings/16-18.htm" title="And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.">2Kings 16:18</a>), evidently a unique and remarkable structure. But it must be noticed that the LXX. and Vulgate and other versions render here, "the burnt offerings, which he offered in the house of the Lord," and Josephus has the same interpretation. The magnificent scale of his sacrifices is illustrated in <a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm" title="And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.">1Kings 8:63</a>, and it is certainly natural that this point should not be left unmentioned in the description of the wonders of his court. This rendering, therefore, which the Hebrew will well bear, has much probability to recommend it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house he had built</span> [ver. 5 compels us to understand this of the palace, not of the temple.
