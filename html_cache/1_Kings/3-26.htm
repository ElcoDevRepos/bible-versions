The woman whose son was alive is directly appealing to the king, demonstrating the practice of seeking justice from the highest authority. This reflects the biblical principle of seeking wisdom and justice from God-appointed leaders, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-13</a>, where difficult cases are brought before the priests and judges.<p><b>because she yearned with compassion for her son.</b><br>The phrase underscores the natural maternal instinct and deep compassion a mother has for her child. This compassion is a reflection of God's own compassion for His children, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>, where God compares His love to that of a mother's. The Hebrew word for compassion here is "racham," which is often used to describe God's mercy.<p><b>&#8220;Please, my lord,&#8221; she said,</b><br>The woman's plea is respectful and earnest, addressing Solomon as "my lord," which indicates her recognition of his authority and wisdom. This respect for authority is consistent with biblical teachings on honoring leaders, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>.<p><b>&#8220;give her the living baby. Do not kill him!&#8221;</b><br>Her willingness to give up her child to save his life is a profound act of selflessness and love. This mirrors the sacrificial love that is central to Christian teachings, exemplified by Jesus Christ's sacrifice for humanity (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>). Her plea also reflects the biblical principle of valuing life, as seen in the commandment "You shall not murder" (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>).<p><b>But the other woman said,</b><br>The introduction of the second woman's response sets up a stark contrast between the two women. This contrast is a literary device used throughout Scripture to highlight moral and ethical differences, similar to the parables of Jesus that contrast the righteous and the wicked (e.g., the parable of the wise and foolish virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>).<p><b>&#8220;He will be neither mine nor yours. Cut him in two!&#8221;</b><br>This shocking statement reveals the hardness of the second woman's heart and her lack of maternal compassion. Her willingness to see the child killed rather than belong to the other woman illustrates the destructive nature of envy and bitterness, akin to the destructive power of sin described in <a href="/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14-16</a>. This moment also serves as a test of Solomon's wisdom, as he discerns the true mother through their responses, fulfilling the divine promise of wisdom given to him in <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, which he received from God.
