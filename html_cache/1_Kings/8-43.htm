This reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of gods residing in the heavens, yet the God of Israel is unique in His accessibility and willingness to hear prayers from His people and foreigners alike. The concept of God hearing from heaven is also seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/6-21.htm">2 Chronicles 6:21</a>, where Solomon asks God to hear the prayers made toward the temple.<p><b>and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You</b><br>This highlights the inclusivity of God's covenant, extending beyond Israel to all nations. It reflects the Abrahamic promise in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a> that all peoples on earth will be blessed through Abraham's descendants. The foreigner, or "stranger," is often mentioned in the Old Testament as someone who should be treated with justice and compassion (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>). This anticipates the New Testament revelation that salvation through Christ is available to all, Jew and Gentile alike (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-22</a>).<p><b>Then all the peoples of the earth will know Your name and fear You</b><br>This phrase underscores the missional aspect of Israel's faith, where the knowledge of God and reverence for Him is not limited to Israel but intended for all nations. The fear of the Lord is a recurring theme in wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, and signifies a deep respect and awe for God's power and holiness. This anticipates the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>as do Your people Israel</b><br>Here, the relationship between God and Israel is highlighted as a model for other nations. Israel's unique covenant relationship with God is meant to be a testimony to the world, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6-8</a>, where the laws and wisdom of Israel are to be a witness to the surrounding nations. This foreshadows the role of the Church as the body of Christ, called to be a light to the world (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>).<p><b>and they will know that this house I have built is called by Your Name</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem is central to Israel's worship and identity, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The phrase "called by Your Name" indicates ownership and divine endorsement, similar to the way God's name is associated with His people (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The temple serves as a type of Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), signifying that He is the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem and is offering this prayer of dedication to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigner.htm">Foreigner</a></b><br>A non-Israelite who comes to the temple to pray, seeking God's favor and acknowledging His sovereignty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>Described as God's dwelling place, from where He hears and answers prayers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are meant to be a light to the nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The physical structure in Jerusalem built by Solomon, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_universal_invitation.htm">God's Universal Invitation</a></b><br>God's invitation to know Him is extended to all people, not just Israel.
