This action reflects Solomon's wisdom and ambition to enhance trade and wealth, aligning with his reputation for prosperity and wisdom. The fleet was likely used for trade expeditions, particularly to Ophir, known for its gold. This initiative demonstrates Solomon's ability to leverage Israel's geographical position for economic gain, similar to how he utilized alliances and marriages to secure political stability.<p><b>at Ezion-geber</b><br>Ezion-geber is identified as a port city on the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba, part of the Red Sea. Archaeological evidence suggests it was a significant center for copper smelting and trade during Solomon's reign. The location was strategically chosen for its access to maritime routes, facilitating trade with distant lands. This site underscores Solomon's strategic acumen in selecting locations that would maximize Israel's trade potential.<p><b>which is near Eloth</b><br>Eloth, or Elat, is another port city close to Ezion-geber. Its mention highlights the importance of this region as a hub for trade and commerce. Historically, Eloth was a key location for trade routes connecting the Arabian Peninsula with the Levant. The proximity of Ezion-geber to Eloth suggests a network of ports that Solomon utilized to control and expand trade operations.<p><b>in Edom</b><br>Edom was a neighboring kingdom to the south of Israel, often in conflict with Israel. However, during Solomon's reign, Edom was under Israelite control, allowing Solomon to exploit its resources and strategic locations. This control over Edom reflects the extent of Solomon's kingdom and his ability to maintain peace and stability through political and military means.<p><b>on the shore of the Red Sea</b><br>The Red Sea was a crucial maritime route for ancient trade, connecting the Mediterranean with the Indian Ocean. By establishing a fleet here, Solomon tapped into the lucrative trade networks of the ancient world, including those reaching as far as Africa and India. This move not only increased Israel's wealth but also its influence in international trade. The Red Sea's mention emphasizes the global reach of Solomon's economic policies and the fulfillment of God's promise to make Israel a prosperous nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.

It lies at the head of the Gulf of Akabah, the nearest point of the Red Sea, on the edge of the mountain country of Edom. Its very name ("the giant's backbone") indicates the nature of the country around it, which (it has been noted) could hardly have itself supplied timber for ship-building. But from <a href="/2_chronicles/8-18.htm" title="And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.">2Chronicles 8:18</a> it appears that the ships, or the materials from which they were built, were sent from Tyre.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And king Solomon made a navy of ships</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, a collective noun, <span class="accented">classis</span>. The chronicler paraphrases by <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, plural. This fact finds a record here, probably because it was to the voyages of this fleet that the king was indebted for the gold which enabled him to erect and adorn the buildings recently described. (As to form, etc., of the ships, see Dict. Bib. 2. p. 1014). But no historian could pass over without notice an event of such profound importance to Israel as the construction of its first ships, which, next to the temple, was the great event of Solomon's reign] <span class="cmt_word">in Ezion-geber</span> [lit., the <span class="accented">backbone of a man</span> (or <span class="accented">giant</span>).

The name is probably due, like Shechem (see note on 1 Kings 12:25) to a real or fancied resemblance in the physical geography of the country to that part of the human body. Stanley (S. and P. p. 84) speaks of "the jagged ranges on each side of the gulf." <span class="accented">Akaba</span>, the modern name, also means <span class="accented">back</span>. 2 Chronicles <span class="accented">l.c.</span> says Solomon went to Ezion-geber, which it is highly probable he would do], <span class="cmt_word">which is beside</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> = aloud (Gesen., Lex. <span class="accented">s.v.</span>)] <span class="cmt_word">Eloth</span> [lit., <span class="accented">trees</span> akin to Elim, where were <span class="accented">palm</span> trees (<a href="/exodus/15-27.htm">Exodus 15:27</a>; <a href="/exodus/16-1.htm">Exodus 16:1</a>). The name is interesting as suggesting that Solomon may have found some of the timber for the construction of his fleet here. A grove of palm trees "still exists at the head of the gulf of Akaba" (Stanley S. and P. p. 20). Palms, it is true, are not adapted to shipbuilding, but other timber may have grown there in a past age. But see note on ver. 27. For Elath, see Porter, p. 40; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-8.htm">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a> (which shows how it passed into the hand of Israel); <a href="/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>.
