Each official was responsible for one month of the year. The name "Ben-hesed" means "son of Hesed," indicating a lineage or family connection, which was common in ancient Israelite society. Arubboth is a location in the tribal territory of Judah, though its exact location is not definitively known today. This appointment reflects the administrative organization and the centralized governance under Solomon's reign, showcasing the prosperity and order during his rule.<p><b>(Socoh and all the land of Hepher belonged to him);</b><br>Socoh is a town in the lowlands of Judah, mentioned in other biblical passages such as <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>, where the Philistines camped before the battle with David and Goliath. This indicates its strategic importance. The land of Hepher is less clearly identified but is thought to be in the region of Manasseh, suggesting that Ben-hesed's jurisdiction covered a significant and possibly diverse area. This allocation of land to officials highlights the extensive reach of Solomon's kingdom and the need for effective governance over various regions. The mention of these specific locations underscores the historical and geographical context of Solomon's administration, reflecting the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hesed.htm">Ben-Hesed</a></b><br>One of Solomon's twelve district governors, responsible for providing provisions for the king and his household for one month each year.
