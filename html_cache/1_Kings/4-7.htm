This system ensured efficient governance and resource management across the diverse tribes of Israel. The number twelve is significant in biblical terms, often symbolizing completeness or divine order, as seen with the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles in the New Testament. This structure may have been influenced by Egyptian or other Near Eastern administrative practices, as Solomon's reign was marked by international alliances and cultural exchanges.<p><b>to provide food for the king and his household</b><br>The provision of food for the king and his household indicates the wealth and prosperity of Solomon's reign. The king's household would have been extensive, including family, servants, and officials. This system of provision highlights the centralization of resources and the importance of hospitality and sustenance in ancient Near Eastern cultures. It also underscores the responsibility of the governors to support the king's court, reflecting the hierarchical nature of the society.<p><b>Each one would arrange provisions for one month of the year</b><br>This rotational system of provision ensured a steady supply of resources and prevented any single region from being overburdened. It reflects a well-organized and fair distribution of responsibilities among the governors. This method of governance can be seen as a precursor to modern systems of taxation and resource allocation. The monthly rotation also mirrors the agricultural calendar, aligning with the cycles of planting and harvest, which were crucial for sustaining the kingdom's economy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.
