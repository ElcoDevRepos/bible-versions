The use of "LORD" in all caps signifies the divine name YHWH, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This expression of blessing is a recognition of God's active role in the affairs of Israel, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. It echoes similar declarations found in Psalms and other historical books, where God's intervention and provision are celebrated.<p><b>Today He has provided one to sit on my throne,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the immediate fulfillment of God's promise to David regarding his dynasty. The "throne" symbolizes not just political power but also the continuation of God's covenant with David, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>. The phrase "provided one" indicates divine selection and approval, underscoring the belief that God is the ultimate authority in appointing leaders. This moment is significant in the biblical narrative as it marks the transition of kingship from David to Solomon, ensuring the stability and continuity of the Davidic line.<p><b>and my eyes have seen it.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>David's personal witness to the fulfillment of God's promise is a testament to his faith and God's faithfulness. The phrase "my eyes have seen it" conveys a sense of personal satisfaction and divine assurance. It is reminiscent of other biblical figures who witnessed God's promises come to fruition, such as Simeon in <a href="/luke/2-29.htm">Luke 2:29-32</a>, who saw the Messiah before his death. This moment serves as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus, the descendant of David, who establishes an eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The aging king of Israel who is nearing the end of his reign.
