In the context of <a href="/1_kings/1.htm">1 Kings 1</a>, Adonijah, another of David's sons, had declared himself king without David's approval. The phrase underscores the importance of swift action to ensure the rightful succession. The immediacy also reflects the biblical principle of fulfilling one's promises without delay, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/james/5-12.htm">James 5:12</a>, which emphasizes the importance of keeping one's word.<p><b>exactly what I swore to you</b><br>David's promise to Bathsheba regarding Solomon's succession is a solemn vow. In ancient Israel, oaths were binding and taken very seriously, often invoking God's name as a witness. This reflects the cultural and religious importance of oaths in the biblical narrative, as seen in <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>, which stresses the obligation to fulfill vows made to the Lord.<p><b>by the LORD, the God of Israel</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine authority and covenant relationship between God and Israel. David's oath is not just a personal promise but one made before God, emphasizing its sacredness. The invocation of God's name underscores the belief that God is actively involved in the affairs of Israel, guiding and establishing leadership, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Surely your son Solomon will reign after me</b><br>This statement confirms Solomon as the divinely chosen successor to David. Solomon's reign is significant as it fulfills God's promise to David that his lineage would continue on the throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Solomon's kingship is also a type of Christ, foreshadowing the eternal reign of Jesus, the Son of David, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>.<p><b>and he will sit on my throne in my place.</b><br>The throne symbolizes legitimate authority and continuity of David's dynasty. Solomon sitting on David's throne signifies the transfer of power and the fulfillment of God's promise to establish David's line. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus is described as sitting on the throne of David, establishing His eternal kingdom (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The aging king of Israel who is ensuring the succession of his throne to Solomon, as he had promised.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, chosen by God and David to be the next king of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The mother of Solomon, who reminds David of his promise regarding Solomon's succession.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>Another son of David who attempts to usurp the throne, prompting David to reaffirm Solomon's kingship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where these events unfold and where Solomon is to be anointed king.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Promises</a></b><br>God's promises are sure and steadfast.
