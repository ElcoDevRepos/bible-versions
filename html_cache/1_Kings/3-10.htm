In the biblical context, God's pleasure often signifies alignment with His will and purposes. The Lord's pleasure is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/147-11.htm">Psalm 147:11</a>, where God delights in those who fear Him and hope in His steadfast love. This approval underscores the importance of seeking wisdom and understanding over personal gain or power, reflecting God's values.<p><b>that Solomon</b><br>Solomon, the son of King David and Bathsheba, was the third king of Israel. His reign is noted for peace, prosperity, and the building of the Temple in Jerusalem. Solomon's request for wisdom is significant because it sets the tone for his rule and highlights his initial humility and desire to govern justly. Solomon's life is a type of Christ in that he is a king of peace and wisdom, prefiguring the ultimate wisdom and peace found in Jesus.<p><b>had made this request.</b><br>Solomon's request for wisdom, rather than long life, riches, or the death of his enemies, demonstrates a heart aligned with God's priorities. This request is made during a dream at Gibeon, where Solomon had gone to offer sacrifices. The cultural context of the time valued wisdom highly, as seen in the wisdom literature of the ancient Near East. Solomon's request is reminiscent of <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, which encourages believers to ask God for wisdom.
