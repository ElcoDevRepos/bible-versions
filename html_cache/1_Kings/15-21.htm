His reign was marked by conflict with the southern kingdom of Judah. The "this" refers to the alliance between King Asa of Judah and Ben-Hadad I of Aram, which was a strategic move to divert Baasha's attention. This alliance is a demonstration of the political maneuvering common in the ancient Near East, where smaller kingdoms often sought alliances to counterbalance more powerful neighbors. The news of this alliance would have been a significant threat to Baasha's military and political strategy.<p><b>he stopped fortifying Ramah</b><br>Ramah was a strategically important city located about five miles north of Jerusalem. Baasha's fortification of Ramah was intended to control the movement between the northern and southern kingdoms, effectively blockading Judah. The cessation of this fortification indicates a shift in Baasha's priorities due to the threat posed by the alliance between Judah and Aram. This move highlights the constant tension and warfare between the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah, as well as the importance of controlling key locations for military advantage.<p><b>and withdrew to Tirzah</b><br>Tirzah served as the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel before the establishment of Samaria by Omri. It was a city of considerable importance and beauty, as noted in <a href="/songs/6-4.htm">Song of Solomon 6:4</a>. Baasha's withdrawal to Tirzah suggests a strategic retreat to a more defensible position, possibly to regroup and reassess his military strategy in light of the new threat. This move underscores the instability and frequent changes in leadership and strategy that characterized the northern kingdom during this period. Tirzah's role as a capital city also reflects the political and administrative shifts within the kingdom of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/baasha.htm">Baasha</a></b><br>King of Israel who reigned after overthrowing Nadab, the son of Jeroboam.

The report reaches Baasha, king of Israel.<p>&#8226; The words show an immediate, real-time response. Scripture presents events as historical fact, not legend (cf. <a href="/1_kings/16-6.htm">1 Kings 16:6</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s hand is evident behind political news. While Asa&#8217;s treaty appears purely diplomatic, 2 Chron 16:7-9 reveals the Lord was orchestrating events and later rebuked Asa for relying on Syria instead of on Him.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that leaders, though powerful, react to circumstances the Lord controls (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He stopped fortifying Ramah</b><p>&#8220;he stopped fortifying Ramah&#8221; highlights Baasha&#8217;s abandoned building project.<p>&#8226; Ramah lay about five miles north of Jerusalem on the main north-south road, letting Baasha choke Judah&#8217;s trade and travel (<a href="/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Fortifying the town showed Baasha&#8217;s intention to maintain long-term pressure on Judah, much like Jeroboam&#8217;s earlier defensive building at Shechem and Penuel (<a href="/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Asa&#8217;s counter-move forced a reversal: Baasha &#8220;stopped.&#8221; The sudden halt underlines how quickly human plans crumble when God shifts the balance (<a href="/isaiah/8-10.htm">Isaiah 8:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p>&#8226; 2 Chron 16:5 reports that Baasha &#8220;abandoned his work,&#8221; echoing the same decisive cessation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and withdrew to Tirzah</b><p>&#8220;and withdrew to Tirzah&#8221; describes Baasha retreating to his capital.<p>&#8226; Tirzah served as Israel&#8217;s seat of government from Jeroboam through Zimri (<a href="/1_kings/14-17.htm">1 Kings 14:17</a>; 15:33; 16:6, 15).<p>&#8226; Baasha&#8217;s pullback leaves Ramah unfinished and undefended, allowing Asa to dismantle the materials and build up Geba and Mizpah for Judah (<a href="/1_kings/15-22.htm">1 Kings 15:22</a>; 2 Chron 16:6).<p>&#8226; The retreat foreshadows Baasha&#8217;s eventual downfall pronounced by the prophet Jehu (<a href="/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1-4</a>). God permits wicked schemes for a season, then brings accountability (<a href="/job/12-23.htm">Job 12:23</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p>&#8226; By returning to Tirzah instead of pressing the fight, Baasha unknowingly fulfills divine purposes: Judah&#8217;s highway reopens, and the Davidic kingdom gains breathing room (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/15-21.htm">1 Kings 15:21</a> records a swift chain reaction: Baasha hears, halts, and heads home. The verse showcases God&#8217;s sovereign ability to redirect political agendas, unravel fortifications, and protect His covenant people. What seemed a mere military maneuver becomes a testimony that &#8220;the counsel of the LORD stands forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Dwelt in Tirzah</span>--that is, returned to his own capital: in the first instance, of course, retiring to meet the new enemy in the north, and then obliged to give up his attempt against Asa.
