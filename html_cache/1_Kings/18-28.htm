The shouting indicates their desperation and fervor, as they believed that increased volume and intensity might gain Baal's attention. This reflects the practices of pagan worship, where emotional and physical displays were thought to appease or manipulate deities. In contrast, the God of Israel is depicted as one who hears the prayers of His people without the need for such displays (<a href="/1_kings/18-24.htm">1 Kings 18:24, 36</a>-37).<p><b>and cut themselves with knives and lances</b><br>Self-mutilation was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern religions, intended to demonstrate devotion or to provoke a response from the gods. This act of cutting was a ritualistic expression of extreme piety and desperation. The use of knives and lances suggests a violent and chaotic scene, highlighting the futility and despair of idol worship. <a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a> explicitly forbids such practices among the Israelites, emphasizing the distinctiveness of their worship and the sanctity of the human body.<p><b>as was their custom</b><br>The phrase indicates that this was not a spontaneous act but a regular part of Baal worship. It underscores the entrenched nature of these practices within the religious culture of the time. This custom contrasts sharply with the worship of Yahweh, which was based on obedience and faith rather than physical harm or spectacle. The prophets' adherence to such customs reveals the depth of their spiritual blindness and the power of cultural traditions over truth.<p><b>until the blood gushed over them</b><br>The vivid imagery of blood gushing underscores the extreme measures taken by the prophets of Baal. Bloodletting was believed to be a powerful means of gaining divine favor, yet it also symbolizes the life force being drained away, pointing to the ultimate powerlessness of their gods. This scene foreshadows the sacrificial system in Israel, where blood was central but was offered in a controlled, God-ordained manner, ultimately pointing to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed once for all (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>).

A new scene then opens. One of them, who surpasses all the rest in frenzy, begins to prophesy with sighs and groans," etc. In the "Contemporary Review," vol. 27, pp. 371 sqq., Bishop Caldwell has graphically described the devil dances of Southern India - a description which may be read with profit in this connexion. One sentence may be transcribed here: "He cuts and hacks and hews himself, and not unfrequently kills himself there and then." Kitto mentions "the furious gashes which the Persians inflict upon themselves in their frantic annual lamentation for Hossein."

It is perfectly clear that their faith in Baal was sincere and profound. Making due allowance for the fact that they were under the eyes of their king and patron, and of representatives of the entire people, it is still impossible to doubt their sincerity. Some of them, it is probable, were Phoenicians.
