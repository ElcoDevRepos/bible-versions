The Spirit's role in transporting individuals is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12-14</a> and <a href="/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39-40</a>, where Philip is carried away by the Spirit. This highlights the sovereignty and power of God, who directs His servants according to His will. The uncertainty of Elijah's location underscores the divine nature of his mission and the miraculous elements often present in the lives of prophets.<p><b>Then when I go and tell Ahab and he does not find you, he will kill me.</b><br>Obadiah fears for his life because King Ahab, known for his wickedness and idolatry, would likely react violently if Elijah could not be found. This reflects the dangerous political climate in Israel under Ahab's rule, where prophets of the LORD were persecuted. Ahab's marriage to Jezebel, a fervent worshiper of Baal, further intensified hostility towards the prophets of Yahweh. Obadiah's fear is justified, as Ahab had previously sought Elijah to hold him accountable for the drought (<a href="/1_kings/18-10.htm">1 Kings 18:10</a>).<p><b>But I, your servant, have feared the LORD from my youth.</b><br>Obadiah's declaration of his lifelong devotion to the LORD serves as a testament to his faithfulness amidst a corrupt society. His fear of the LORD indicates reverence and obedience, aligning with the biblical principle that the fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). Obadiah's position in Ahab's court as a devout believer illustrates the presence of faithful individuals even in ungodly environments. His actions, such as hiding and sustaining the prophets (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>), demonstrate his commitment to God's work despite personal risk.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who played a crucial role in challenging the idolatry of Israel and demonstrating God's power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/obadiah.htm">Obadiah</a></b><br>A devout believer in the LORD who served as the palace administrator under King Ahab.

He believes Elijah can be physically relocated by the Spirit at any moment, as God had previously hidden Elijah from Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/17-2.htm">1 Kings 17:2&#8211;5, 8</a>&#8211;10).<p>&#8226; Scripture records other literal instances of supernatural transport: Ezekiel is lifted by the Spirit (<a href="/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12, 14</a>); Philip is caught away from the Ethiopian eunuch (<a href="/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39&#8211;40</a>); later men search for Elijah in vain after his translation (<a href="/2_kings/2-16.htm">2 Kings 2:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Obadiah&#8217;s statement is therefore not exaggerated; it reflects a genuine expectation that God can and does move His servants instantaneously when it serves His purpose (<a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The peril Obadiah faces with Ahab</b><p>&#8220;Then when I go and tell Ahab and he does not find you, he will kill me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Ahab has scoured every kingdom and nation for Elijah and exacted oaths from kings affirming the prophet could not be found (<a href="/1_kings/18-10.htm">1 Kings 18:10</a>).<p>&#8226; By commanding Obadiah to announce his presence, Elijah places the royal steward between an angry king and an apparently vanished prophet. Should Elijah disappear again, Ahab&#8217;s pattern of violence (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>) makes Obadiah&#8217;s fear entirely reasonable.<p>&#8226; The verse highlights the cost of obedience under a hostile regime. Like Daniel&#8217;s friends before Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/3-16.htm">Daniel 3:16&#8211;18</a>) and the apostles before the Sanhedrin (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>), Obadiah must weigh mortal danger against faithfulness to God&#8217;s word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Obadiah&#8217;s lifelong reverence</b><p>&#8220;But I, your servant, have feared the LORD from my youth.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Obadiah distinguishes himself from the idolatrous court by a consistent, personal commitment to the LORD, begun in childhood and demonstrated by action&#8212;he hid and fed one hundred prophets during Jezebel&#8217;s purge (<a href="/1_kings/18-3.htm">1 Kings 18:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; A lifelong fear of the LORD produces tangible fruit: integrity (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>), courage (<a href="/psalms/112-1.htm">Psalm 112:1, 7</a>&#8211;8), and compassion for God&#8217;s people (<a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; His testimony echoes others who served God from youth&#8212;Joseph (<a href="/genesis/39-9.htm">Genesis 39:9</a>), Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19</a>), Timothy (<a href="/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>)&#8212;showing that early devotion can endure even in corrupt environments.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a> captures Obadiah&#8217;s dilemma: he trusts the living God who can move Elijah by His Spirit, yet he dreads Ahab&#8217;s lethal wrath if Elijah cannot be produced. His appeal rests on two realities&#8212;God&#8217;s sovereignty to relocate His prophet at will and his own verified history of fearing the LORD. The verse therefore exposes the tension between divine unpredictability and human responsibility, while illustrating that steadfast reverence for God sustains His servants in the face of mortal risk.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">The Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee.</span>--In this phrase there is perhaps a survival of the original physical sense of the word "Spirit"--the whirlwind which is "the breath of the Lord."

To Obadiah it seemed that only by such miraculous agency could Elijah have been removed from the persecution for so long a time, and that, having emerged for a moment, he will be swept away into his hidden refuge again.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">I shall go from thee, and</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee whither I know not</span> [These words, which literally translated are "<span class="accented">shall lift thee up upon where</span>," etc., are to be explained by <a href="/2_kings/2-16.htm">2 Kings 2:16</a>, "lest the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up" (same word) "and <span class="accented">cast him upon some mountain</span>," etc. Seb. Schmidt, Wordsworth, <span class="accented">al</span>. think that such a transportation must have already occurred in the history of Elijah, but the sudden, mysterious disappearance and the long concealment of the prophet is quite sufficient to account for Obadiah's fear. Compare <a href="/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>. The words do suggest, however, that it had been believed by some that the Lord had hid Elijah, and it is not improbable that during his long absence rumours had often gained credence that he had been seen and had suddenly disappeared, just as later Jews have held that he "has appeared again and again as an Arabian merchant to wise and good Rabbis at their prayers or in their journeys" (Stanley)]; <span class="cmt_word">and so when I come and tell</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and I come to tell</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me</span> [This is just what a prince like Ahab, or any prince who was under the guidance of a Jezebel, would do, out of sheer vexation at losing his prey when so nearly in his grasp]: <span class="cmt_word">but</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and</span>] <span class="cmt_word">I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth.</span> [Obadiah's meaning clearly is not that he, "as a God-fearing man and a protector of the prophets, cannot have any special favour to expect from Ahab" (Keil; similarly Ewald), but that it was hard that one who was a steadfast worshipper of Elijah's God should be slain for his sake. It is extremely unlikely that Ahab knew of Obadiah's having protected the prophets. He could hardly have maintained him in his post had he known that the steward of the palace had thwarted the designs of his queen.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/18-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1428;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">where</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1434;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Spirit</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
