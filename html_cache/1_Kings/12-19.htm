The split occurred after the reign of Solomon, around 930 BC, and persisted throughout the biblical narrative. The phrase "to this day" suggests that the division was still recognized at the time of the writing of 1 Kings, which is traditionally attributed to the period of the Babylonian exile. This enduring division highlights the long-lasting consequences of disobedience and poor leadership decisions.<p><b>Israel has been in rebellion</b><br>The term "rebellion" refers to the northern tribes' rejection of Rehoboam, Solomon's son, as their king. This rebellion was sparked by Rehoboam's harsh response to the people's request for lighter burdens, leading to Jeroboam's rise as the leader of the northern tribes. Theologically, this rebellion can be seen as a fulfillment of God's judgment on Solomon's idolatry and disobedience, as prophesied by Ahijah the Shilonite (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-39</a>). The rebellion also signifies a spiritual departure from the Davidic covenant, which promised a united kingdom under David's lineage.<p><b>against the house of David</b><br>The "house of David" refers to the dynastic line established by God through David, with promises of an everlasting kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The division of the kingdom represents a significant breach in the unity of the Israelite nation, which was meant to be a single entity under Davidic rule. This division foreshadows the eventual coming of Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic covenant, who would unite all believers under His eternal kingship (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>). The rebellion against the house of David also serves as a reminder of the human tendency to reject God's chosen leadership, a theme that recurs throughout biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the ten northern tribes that broke away from the united kingdom of Israel after the reign of Solomon.
