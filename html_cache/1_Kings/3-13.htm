Solomon asked for wisdom to govern the people, but God chose to bless him with more than he requested. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>, where God is described as able to do "immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine." It underscores the idea that God knows our needs and desires even before we express them, and He often provides beyond our expectations.<p><b>both riches and honor&#8212;</b><br>Riches and honor were significant in the ancient Near Eastern context, often seen as signs of divine favor and blessing. Solomon's wealth and reputation became legendary, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/10-23.htm">1 Kings 10:23-25</a>, where his wealth and wisdom attracted visitors from all over the world, including the Queen of Sheba. This also prefigures the ultimate honor and riches found in Christ, who, though He was rich, became poor for our sake (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>).<p><b>so that during all your days no man in any kingdom will be your equal.</b><br>This promise of unparalleled status is a testament to Solomon's unique role in Israel's history. His reign is often considered the golden age of Israel, marked by peace, prosperity, and extensive building projects, including the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. This phrase also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who is described in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a> as having a name above every name, with every knee bowing to Him. Solomon's unparalleled status is a type of the ultimate kingship of Christ, who reigns supreme over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building the First Temple in Jerusalem.

Just as the parallel account states, &#8220;Wisdom and knowledge have been granted to you, and I will also give you wealth, riches, and honor&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/1-12.htm">2 Chronicles 1:12</a>), the Lord delights in generous overflow when His child&#8217;s heart is aligned with His purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will give you what you did not request</b><p>Solomon had petitioned only for an understanding heart to govern God&#8217;s people.

Scripture often pairs these gifts as outcomes of reverent living: &#8220;The reward of humility and the fear of the LORD are riches and honor and life&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/22-4.htm">Proverbs 22:4</a>). In Solomon&#8217;s case:<p>&#8226;&#8195;Wealth&#8212;described later in <a href="/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21-23</a> where silver is considered of little value.<p>&#8226;&#8195;Honor&#8212;illustrated when &#8220;all the earth sought audience with Solomon&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/10-24.htm">1 Kings 10:24</a>).<p>Such blessings are not ends in themselves but tools for magnifying God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/psalms/112-1.htm">Psalm 112:1-3</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that during all your days</b><p>The favor is lifelong, underscoring God&#8217;s faithfulness to sustain His promises. Like Joshua, Solomon is assured continuous success if he walks in obedience (<a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7-9</a>). This phrase stresses that God&#8217;s gifts are not fleeting but are meant to accompany steadfast devotion (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-29.htm">Deuteronomy 5:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>no man in any kingdom will be your equal</b><p>God sets Solomon apart, granting unrivaled status. Fulfillment appears in <a href="/2_chronicles/9-22.htm">2 Chronicles 9:22-23</a>: &#8220;King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth.&#8221; His supremacy prefigures Christ, &#8220;in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>), the ultimate King to whom every knee will bow (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a> reveals God&#8217;s heart to bless abundantly when His servant seeks wisdom above self-gain.
