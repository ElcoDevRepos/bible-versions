In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings often relied on messengers and informants to keep them updated on the activities within their realm. This reflects the administrative structure of Solomon's reign, which was marked by wisdom and organization.<p><b>that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem</b><br>Shimei, a member of the tribe of Benjamin, had previously cursed David but was spared by him. Solomon, however, placed Shimei under house arrest in Jerusalem, forbidding him to leave. Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel, was where Solomon established his rule. Shimei's departure from the city signifies a breach of Solomon's command, which was a serious offense in the context of ancient covenantal and legal systems.<p><b>to Gath</b><br>Gath was one of the five Philistine city-states and a significant location in the biblical narrative. It was known for its association with giants, such as Goliath, whom David defeated. Shimei's journey to Gath could imply seeking refuge or alliances outside of Israel, which would be seen as a potential threat to Solomon's rule. The Philistines were often adversaries of Israel, and any interaction with them could be viewed with suspicion.<p><b>and had returned</b><br>Shimei's return to Jerusalem after his unauthorized departure suggests a disregard for Solomon's authority. This act of defiance would have been seen as a challenge to the king's command and a test of his resolve to enforce justice. In the broader biblical narrative, this incident foreshadows the consequences of disobedience and the importance of adhering to divine and royal decrees. Solomon's response to Shimei's actions would further establish his authority and commitment to upholding the law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the king of Israel at this time.
