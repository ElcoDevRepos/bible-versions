In the biblical context, prophets were often used by God to convey His will and judgment. Elijah, a prominent prophet in Israel, is acting as God's mouthpiece. This underscores the authority and seriousness of the message, as it is not merely human opinion but a direct communication from God.<p><b>&#8216;Have you not murdered a man and seized his land?&#8217;</b><br>This accusation refers to King Ahab's role in the death of Naboth and the subsequent acquisition of his vineyard. Naboth was unjustly accused and executed, a violation of the commandment "You shall not murder" (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>). The phrase highlights the moral and legal transgressions of Ahab, who, though not directly responsible for Naboth's death, was complicit through his wife Jezebel's actions. This reflects the broader biblical theme of justice and the consequences of sin.<p><b>Then tell him that this is also what the LORD says:</b><br>The repetition of "this is what the LORD says" emphasizes the certainty and importance of the forthcoming judgment. It serves as a reminder that God's words are not to be taken lightly and that His justice will be executed.<p><b>&#8216;In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth,</b><br>This phrase refers to the aftermath of Naboth's unjust execution, where dogs licked his blood, a detail that signifies disgrace and dishonor in ancient Near Eastern culture. The mention of dogs, often seen as unclean animals, adds to the ignominy of the situation. This specific location becomes a prophetic symbol of divine retribution.<p><b>there also the dogs will lick up your blood&#8212;yes, yours!&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This prophecy foretells the violent and dishonorable death of Ahab, mirroring the fate of Naboth. The repetition of "yes, yours" serves to personalize and confirm the certainty of the judgment. This prophecy is fulfilled in <a href="/1_kings/22-38.htm">1 Kings 22:38</a>, where Ahab's blood is indeed licked by dogs, demonstrating the accuracy of God's word and the inevitability of divine justice. This also serves as a typological foreshadowing of the ultimate justice and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who, unlike Ahab, embodies perfect righteousness and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who coveted Naboth's vineyard and allowed his wife, Jezebel, to orchestrate Naboth's murder to acquire it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezebel.htm">Jezebel</a></b><br>Ahab's wife, known for her idolatry and manipulation, who plotted Naboth's death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/naboth.htm">Naboth</a></b><br>A righteous Israelite who owned a vineyard that Ahab desired.

Every word carries the full authority of the LORD, the covenant-making, covenant-keeping God (cf. <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). Ahab has defied that covenant, so the living God steps in. When the prophet says, &#8220;Thus says the LORD,&#8221; the matter is settled; Ahab must listen, just as Saul was expected to heed Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Have you not murdered a man and seized his land?&#8217;</b><p>The charge is specific and undeniable. Ahab orchestrated Naboth&#8217;s death through false testimony (<a href="/1_kings/21-11.htm">1 Kings 21:11-13</a>), breaking at least two commandments: &#8220;You shall not murder&#8221; and &#8220;You shall not steal&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13, 15</a>). God&#8217;s law also protected ancestral inheritance (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7</a>). By treating Naboth&#8217;s vineyard as disposable real estate, Ahab despised life and land alike&#8212;echoing David&#8217;s earlier sin against Uriah (<a href="/2_samuel/12-9.htm">2 Samuel 12:9</a>). The prophetic question exposes guilt and demands repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then tell him that this is also what the LORD says</b><p>A second &#8220;thus says the LORD&#8221; doubles the certainty of judgment. On the testimony of two witnesses a matter is established (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>); here the two divine declarations remove every escape route. God patiently sent prophets before (<a href="/1_kings/18-18.htm">1 Kings 18:18</a>; <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>), yet Ahab silenced them. Now the verdict arrives without appeal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth&#8217;</b><p>Naboth was dragged outside the city and stoned; dogs later licked his blood&#8212;an image of utter disgrace (<a href="/1_kings/21-13.htm">1 Kings 21:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-23.htm">Psalm 68:23</a>). By pinpointing the very ground, God links crime and consequence. The land Ahab coveted becomes the stage of retribution, mirroring <a href="/deuteronomy/19-11.htm">Deuteronomy 19:11-13</a>, where shed blood defiles the soil until justice is done.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;There also the dogs will lick up your blood&#8212;yes, yours!&#8217;</b><p>Divine justice is personal and proportionate. Ahab&#8217;s royal armor will not shield him; his destiny is the same dishonor he forced on Naboth. The prophecy comes true when an arrow finds a gap in Ahab&#8217;s armor and &#8220;the dogs licked up his blood&#8221; at Samaria (<a href="/1_kings/22-34.htm">1 Kings 22:34-38</a>).

Elijah delivers two divine declarations: the charge of murder and theft, and the sentence that fits the crime. The location, the dogs, and the blood all underline a literal, historical fulfillment that vindicates Naboth and proves God&#8217;s justice.

The marked particularity and emphasis of that sentence, "In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick <span class= "ital">thy blood, even thine,</span>" preclude all explanations, which would seek its fulfilment in the fate of Jehoram (<a href="/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;">2Kings 9:25</a>); nor can such explanations be justified by reference to <a href="/1_kings/21-29.htm" title="See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil on his house.">1Kings 21:29</a>, for it is not this part of the sentence which is deferred by Ahab's repentance.

For the construction see Gesen., Gram. &sect; 119. 3; and cf. <a href="/genesis/27-34.htm">Genesis 27:34</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-15.htm">Proverbs 23:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7</a>. Thenius contends that there is a contradiction between this ver. and <a href="/1_kings/22-38.htm">1 Kings 22:38</a> (together with <a href="/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25</a>) which is absolutely insuperable. But as Bahr observes, "How thoughtless our author must have been if in two consecutive chapters - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on the same leaf, as it were - he had inadvertently inserted direct contradictions." And the following considerations will show that the discrepancy is only apparent. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The sentence here pronounced against Ahab was, on his repentance, stayed in its execution. God said distinctly, "I will not bring the evil in his days," and as distinctly added that He would "bring the evil in his <span class="accented">son's days, upon his house"</span> (ver. 29). And <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with the prophecy, as thus modified, the facts exactly record. The body of Jehoram was "cast into the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite" (2 Kings <span class="accented">l.c.</span>). And if it be objected <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that our historian sees in the death of Ahab <span class="accented">in Samaria</span> (ch. 20. <span class="accented">l.c.</span>) a fulfilment of this prophecy, the answer is that that death was a <span class="accented">partial</span> fulfilment of Elijah's words. The repentance of Ahab, having secured him immunity from this sentence, his subsequent folly and sin (cf. <a href="/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a>) nevertheless brought down upon him a judgment of God strikingly similar, as we might expect it would be, to that originally denounced against him, which was now reserved for his son. In ether words, the prophecy was fulfilled to the letter in the person of his son, but it had a secondary fulfilment in its spirit on himself]. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/21-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;ib&#183;bar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
