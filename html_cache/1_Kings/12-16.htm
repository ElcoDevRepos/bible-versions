The king in question is Rehoboam, Solomon's son, who had ascended to the throne. The Israelites had requested lighter burdens, but Rehoboam, rejecting the counsel of the elders, chose to follow the advice of his peers, opting for harsher measures. This refusal to listen reflects a failure in leadership and a lack of empathy, which is a recurring theme in the history of Israel's kings. It also fulfills the prophecy given to Solomon about the division of the kingdom due to his idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>).<p><b>they answered the king: &#8220;What portion do we have in David, and what inheritance in the son of Jesse?</b><br>This rhetorical question signifies the tribes' rejection of the Davidic dynasty's authority over them. David, the son of Jesse, was the revered king who united Israel, but his legacy is now questioned. The phrase indicates a deep-seated division and dissatisfaction with the ruling house, which had been building since Solomon's reign. This sentiment echoes the earlier rebellion of Sheba son of Bichri against David (<a href="/2_samuel/20.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>), showing a historical pattern of tribal tensions.<p><b>To your tents, O Israel!</b><br>This call to action is a declaration of secession. "To your tents" is an idiomatic expression meaning to return to one's home or tribe, effectively dissolving the political unity under the Davidic king. It signifies a return to tribal independence, reminiscent of the pre-monarchic period of the Judges when Israel was a loose confederation of tribes.<p><b>Look now to your own house, O David!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a direct challenge to the Davidic monarchy, urging the king to focus on his own tribe, Judah, rather than the united kingdom. It underscores the division between Judah and the northern tribes, which would become the separate kingdom of Israel. This division is significant in biblical history, as it leads to the establishment of two distinct kingdoms: Israel in the north and Judah in the south.<p><b>So the Israelites went home</b><br>The conclusion of this verse marks the official split of the united kingdom into two separate entities. The northern tribes, rejecting Rehoboam's rule, form their own kingdom under Jeroboam, fulfilling Ahijah's prophecy to Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). This division has lasting implications for Israel's history, leading to different religious practices and eventual conquest by Assyria and Babylon. Theologically, it sets the stage for the prophetic calls for repentance and the hope of a future reunification under a messianic king, a type of Christ who would unite all of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Israel, whose harsh response to the people's request for lighter burdens led to the division of the kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>An official under Solomon who became the leader of the northern tribes and eventually the king of Israel after the division.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the northern tribes who rejected Rehoboam's rule and formed their own kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The former king of Israel, whose lineage Rehoboam belonged to, representing the united monarchy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>The place where Rehoboam went to be crowned king and where the division of the kingdom took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_pride_and_harsh_leadership.htm">The Consequences of Pride and Harsh Leadership</a></b><br>Rehoboam's refusal to listen to wise counsel and his harsh response led to the division of the kingdom.

It had been heard once before, during the conflict between Judah and Israel after the rebellion of Absalom, when it was silenced instantly by the relentless promptitude of Joab (<a href="/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2Samuel 20:1</a>). Only the last ironical line is added, "See to thine own house, David" (which the LXX. explains as "Feed, as a shepherd, thine own house, David"). There is perhaps a sarcastic allusion to God's promise to establish the house of David: "Be a king, but only in thine own house!"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">brought back word to</span>; probably after some consultation amongst themselves] <span class="cmt_word">the king, saying, What portion have we in David?</span> [Same expression as <a href="/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>. The words, interpreted by this passage and <a href="/2_samuel/19-43.htm">2 Samuel 19:43</a>, mean, "Since we have no kindness or fairness from David's seed, what is his house to us?

Bahr sees in the expression "son of Jesse" "an allusion to David's humbler descent," but surely without reason. It is simply a periphrasis for the sake of the parallelism. The rhythm almost elevates the words to the rank of poetry]: <span class="cmt_word">to your tents, O Israel</span> [lit., thy tents, Or dwellings; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "Disperse to your homes (see <a href="/1_kings/8-66.htm">1 Kings 8:66</a>; and cf. <a href="/2_samuel/18-17.htm">2 Samuel 18:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-8.htm">2 Samuel 19:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>), and prepare for war." <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, which means primarily a "tent," has for its secondary meaning, "habitation," "home."
