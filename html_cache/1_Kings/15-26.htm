The "evil" refers to actions contrary to God's commandments, often involving idolatry and injustice. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" underscores God's omniscience and the accountability of leaders to divine standards. This evaluation is a recurring theme in the books of Kings, highlighting the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where obedience brings blessing and disobedience brings judgment.<p><b>and walked in the way of his father</b><br>This phrase suggests a continuation of sinful practices established by the previous generation. The "way of his father" refers to the specific policies and religious practices initiated by Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, who set up golden calves at Bethel and Dan to prevent the Israelites from worshiping in Jerusalem. This phrase highlights the influence of parental and ancestral actions on subsequent generations, a common biblical theme seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, where the iniquity of the fathers affects the children.<p><b>and in his sin,</b><br>The "sin" here is specifically linked to the idolatry introduced by Jeroboam, which became a defining characteristic of the northern kingdom's spiritual decline. This sin was not merely a personal failing but a systemic issue that affected the entire nation. The singular "sin" can be seen as a collective term for the various idolatrous practices that were institutionalized, leading the people away from the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>which he had caused Israel to commit.</b><br>This phrase indicates the king's responsibility for leading the nation into sin. The use of "caused" suggests deliberate actions and policies that encouraged or enforced idolatry and disobedience to God's laws. This reflects the biblical principle that leaders bear significant responsibility for the spiritual direction of their people, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/hosea/4-9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>, where the people's sins are linked to the failures of their leaders. The phrase also underscores the communal aspect of sin in Israel, where the actions of the king had widespread consequences for the entire nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nadab.htm">Nadab</a></b><br>The son of Jeroboam, who became king of Israel.
