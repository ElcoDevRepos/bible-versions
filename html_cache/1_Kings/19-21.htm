This act represents a decisive break from his past life and a willingness to embrace his prophetic calling. In biblical context, turning back often symbolizes repentance or a change in direction, as seen in the story of Ruth (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-17</a>) where Ruth turns away from her homeland to follow Naomi and the God of Israel.<p><b>took his pair of oxen, and slaughtered them</b><br>The slaughtering of the oxen is a significant act of sacrifice and dedication. Oxen were valuable assets in agrarian societies, essential for plowing fields and sustaining livelihoods. By slaughtering them, Elisha demonstrates his total commitment to his new role, similar to the disciples leaving their nets to follow Jesus (<a href="/matthew/4-20.htm">Matthew 4:20</a>). This act can also be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, where something valuable is given up for a greater purpose.<p><b>Using the oxen&#8217;s equipment for fuel</b><br>Burning the equipment signifies a complete severance from his former life. The equipment, likely wooden yokes and plows, would have been essential for his work as a farmer. This act is reminiscent of the call to leave behind old ways and fully commit to God's service, as seen in the New Testament when believers are called to leave behind their old selves (<a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>).<p><b>he cooked the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate</b><br>This communal meal symbolizes fellowship and celebration. Sharing the meat with the people could indicate Elisha's generosity and his desire to bless others as he embarks on his new journey. It reflects the communal nature of God's people, as seen in the early church's practice of sharing meals and resources (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46-47</a>).<p><b>Then he set out to follow and serve Elijah</b><br>Elisha's decision to follow and serve Elijah marks the beginning of his prophetic ministry. This mirrors the call of the disciples to follow Jesus, emphasizing the importance of mentorship and discipleship in spiritual growth. Elisha's service to Elijah is a precursor to his own ministry, highlighting the biblical principle of serving before leading, as seen in the life of Jesus, who came to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to succeed Elijah.

Elisha&#8217;s swift turn, costly sacrifice, communal generosity, and lifelong service illustrate that genuine discipleship:<p>&#8226; responds immediately,<p>&#8226; relinquishes former securities,<p>&#8226; blesses others through obedience,<p>&#8226; and perseveres in humble service until the mantle of ministry is fully assumed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And he returned.</span>--Like Matthew in <a href="/context/luke/9-27.htm" title="But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.">Luke 9:27-29</a>, Elisha, probably after sacrifice, makes a feast of farewell to his home, and of homage to his new master. The hasty preparation is made by the use of the wooden implements for fuel, as in the sacrifice at the threshing-floor of Araunah (<a href="/2_samuel/24-22.htm" title="And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.">2Samuel 24:22</a>). Henceforth from a master he became a servant, ministering to Elijah, and willing to be known, even when he became himself the prophet of God, as "he that poured water on the hands of Elijah" (<a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm" title="But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.">2Kings 3:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he returned back from him</span> [Wordsworth is not warranted in affirming that Elisha "did <span class="accented">not</span> go back and kiss," etc. The text rather implies that he did], <span class="cmt_word">and took a yoke</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the yoke</span>; Cf. ver. 19] <span class="cmt_word">of oxen, and slew them</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">sacrificed</span>; LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>.

The scarcity of timber may have had something to do with this application of the "instruments of the oxen;" but it is much more important to see it in a symbolical act, expressive of Elisha's entire renunciation of his secular calling. He would henceforth need them no longer. Cf. <a href="/1_samuel/6-14.htm">1 Samuel 6:14</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/24-22.htm">2 Samuel 24:22</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and gave unto the people</span> [Not only the servants or peasants who had been ploughing with him, but possibly his neighbours and friends.
