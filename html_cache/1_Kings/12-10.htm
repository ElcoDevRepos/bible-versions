The young men, who had grown up with him, represent a new generation that lacked the wisdom and experience of the elders. This reflects a common biblical theme where youthful inexperience can lead to poor decision-making, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>, which warns about the company one keeps.<p><b>This is how you should answer these people who said to you</b><br>The people of Israel, particularly those from the northern tribes, approached Rehoboam seeking relief from the heavy burdens imposed by Solomon. This request highlights the socio-political tensions within the united monarchy, foreshadowing the eventual division of the kingdom. The phrase underscores the importance of leadership and the consequences of ignoring the people's needs, as seen in the warnings given in <a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11-18</a> about the burdens of a king.<p><b>&#8216;Your father made our yoke heavy, but you must make it lighter.&#8217;</b><br>Solomon's reign, while prosperous, involved heavy taxation and forced labor, especially for his building projects, including the temple and his palace. The term "yoke" symbolizes oppression and servitude, reminiscent of Israel's bondage in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a>). The people's plea for a lighter yoke echoes the biblical principle of justice and mercy, as emphasized in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>.<p><b>This is what you should tell them</b><br>The young men's advice to Rehoboam is a pivotal moment, reflecting a choice between humility and arrogance. The directive to respond harshly contrasts with the biblical call for leaders to serve with humility and compassion, as exemplified by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/20-25.htm">Matthew 20:25-28</a>, where He teaches that true greatness comes from serving others.<p><b>&#8216;My little finger is thicker than my father&#8217;s waist!&#8217;</b><br>This hyperbolic statement signifies an intention to rule with even greater severity than Solomon. The imagery of the "little finger" being thicker than the "waist" suggests an increase in oppression and control. This phrase foreshadows the division of the kingdom, as Rehoboam's harshness leads to the rebellion of the northern tribes (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16-19</a>). It also serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pride and the failure to heed wise counsel, aligning with <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, which warns that pride precedes destruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Israel who faced a critical decision regarding the demands of the people for lighter burdens.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young_men.htm">The Young Men</a></b><br>Rehoboam's peers who advised him to respond harshly to the people's request, contrasting with the elders' counsel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elders.htm">The Elders</a></b><br>Older advisors who counseled Rehoboam to serve the people and speak kindly to them, which he ultimately rejected.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The united kingdom under Solomon, which was on the brink of division due to Rehoboam's decision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>The place where Rehoboam went to be crowned king and where the people of Israel presented their request for lighter burdens.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_wise_counsel.htm">The Importance of Wise Counsel</a></b><br>Rehoboam's choice to listen to his peers rather than the elders demonstrates the need for seeking and heeding wise, godly advice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/servant_leadership.htm">Servant Leadership</a></b><br>True leadership involves serving others, as exemplified by Jesus, rather than exerting power and control.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_pride.htm">Consequences of Pride</a></b><br>Rehoboam's prideful response led to the division of the kingdom, illustrating the destructive nature of pride.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/listening_to_the_people.htm">Listening to the People</a></b><br>Effective leaders listen to the needs and concerns of those they lead, fostering unity and trust.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_humility.htm">The Role of Humility</a></b><br>Humility in leadership can prevent conflict and promote peace, contrasting with Rehoboam's arrogant stance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_12_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 12:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_12_10_Rejecting_wise_counsel.htm">How does 1 Kings 12:10 illustrate the consequences of rejecting wise counsel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_pride_from_1_Kings_12_10.htm">What can we learn about pride from the young men's advice in 1 Kings 12:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_15_22_vs_Rehoboam_s_choice.htm">How does Proverbs 15:22 relate to Rehoboam's decision in 1 Kings 12:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_find_godly_counsel_for_decisions.htm">In what ways can we seek godly counsel in our own decision-making?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Avoid_arrogance_like_in_1_Kings_12_10.htm">How can we avoid the pitfalls of arrogance as seen in 1 Kings 12:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_12_10_Leadership_power_dynamics.htm">How does 1 Kings 12:10 reflect on leadership and power dynamics in biblical times?

It is couched in needlessly and absurdly offensive language; but it is, as all history shows--perhaps not least the history of our own Stuart dynasty--a not unfrequent policy in revolutionary times; holding that to yield in one point is to endanger the whole fabric of sovereign power; relying on the prestige of an authority proudly confident in itself; and trusting to cow by threats the classes long subject to despotic oppression, and despised accordingly by those who wield it. It can succeed only when the popular disaffection is superficial, or when a nation is wearied out with revolutionary fanaticism and failure.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people</span> [There is a certain amount of contemptuousness in the expression (cf. St. <a href="/john/7-49.htm">John 7:49</a>) ] <span class="cmt_word">that spake unto thee</span> [The repetition, "speak, spake," is probably not undesigned. It suggests the idea of retaliation, or that it was a piece of presumption on their part to have spoken at all], <span class="cmt_word">saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us</span> [lit., from upon us]; <span class="cmt_word">thus shalt thou say unto them</span> [This iteration is expressive of determination and resentment. We may read between the lines, "I would make short work with them, and teach them a lesson they will not forget"], <span class="cmt_word">My little finger</span> ["Finger" is not in the original, but the meaning is indisputable] <span class="cmt_word">shall be</span> [or is, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, strictly, <span class="accented">was thicker</span>.

The sense is clear. "My hand shall be heavier than my father's, my force greater than his, my weakness even stronger than his strength." The counsel of the young men is full of flattery, which would be acceptable to a young king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/12-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The young men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
