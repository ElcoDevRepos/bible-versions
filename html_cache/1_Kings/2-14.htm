The speaker is Adonijah, the son of King David, who previously attempted to claim the throne before Solomon was anointed king. This context is crucial as it sets the stage for understanding the political tension and personal motivations behind his words. Adonijah's approach is strategic, as he seeks to communicate a request through Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, hoping to gain favor or influence.<p><b>&#8220;I have something to tell you.&#8221;</b><br>Adonijah's statement is a prelude to a request, reflecting a common cultural practice of approaching someone with influence to intercede on one's behalf. In ancient Near Eastern culture, it was customary to use intermediaries to present requests to those in power. This phrase also suggests a level of respect and formality, as Adonijah seeks to gain Bathsheba's attention and willingness to listen. The phrase can be seen as a foreshadowing of the tension and potential conflict that will arise from his request.<p><b>&#8220;Say it,&#8221; she answered.</b><br>Bathsheba's response indicates her willingness to listen, demonstrating her role as a mediator. Her position as the queen mother gives her a unique influence in the royal court, and her response shows openness to dialogue. This interaction highlights the cultural importance of communication and negotiation in resolving disputes or making requests. Bathsheba's readiness to hear Adonijah's words also reflects her wisdom and understanding of court politics, as she navigates the delicate balance of power between her son Solomon and his rival Adonijah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The son of King David who previously attempted to claim the throne before Solomon was anointed king.
