Baasha came to power by assassinating Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, and he perpetuated the idolatry that Jeroboam had established. This phrase highlights the generational nature of sin, as Elah followed in his father's footsteps. The sins of Baasha and Elah included idolatry and leading the nation away from the worship of Yahweh. This reflects the Deuteronomic principle that leaders' actions have significant consequences for the people they govern (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>and had caused Israel to commit</b><br>The kings of Israel were responsible for leading the nation in covenant faithfulness to God. However, Baasha and Elah led Israel into sin, particularly through the worship of idols. This phrase underscores the influence of leadership and the responsibility of kings to guide their people in righteousness. The sins of the leaders became the sins of the nation, illustrating the communal aspect of sin in the Old Testament. This is reminiscent of the role of the king as a shepherd, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where the leader's actions directly affect the well-being of the people.<p><b>provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger</b><br>The provocation of the LORD refers to the violation of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The anger of God is a response to the breach of this covenant, particularly through idolatry, which is seen as spiritual adultery. This phrase reflects the holiness of God and His intolerance of idolatry, as outlined in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The anger of God is not arbitrary but is a just response to the people's rebellion and unfaithfulness.<p><b>with their worthless idols</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue in Israel's history, often leading to their downfall. The term "worthless" emphasizes the futility and powerlessness of idols compared to the living God. This phrase highlights the contrast between the true God and the false gods that Israel pursued. The prophets frequently condemned idolatry, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where idols are mocked for their inability to save or act. This also points to the New Testament understanding of idolatry as anything that takes the place of God in one's life (<a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/baasha.htm">Baasha</a></b><br>He was the king of Israel who reigned after assassinating Nadab, the son of Jeroboam.

The words &#8220;This happened&#8221; tie the sentence to that judgment. Scripture consistently links divine judgment to human rebellion: &#8220;But if you do not obey the voice of the LORD your God&#8230; all these curses will come upon you&#8221; (De 28:15). God is never arbitrary; He acts in perfect justice, responding to sin exactly as He promised (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-2.htm">1 Kings 16:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Baasha and his son Elah had committed</b><p>Personal guilt lies first with the kings themselves. Baasha murdered Nadab and usurped the throne (<a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27-30</a>). He then &#8220;did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of Jeroboam&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/15-34.htm">1 Kings 15:34</a>). Elah simply continued the pattern, ruling for two years marked by indulgence and drunkenness before he too was assassinated (<a href="/1_kings/16-8.htm">1 Kings 16:8-10</a>). Their sins included:<p>- Premeditated violence (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-7.htm">1 Kings 16:7</a>)<p>- Systematic idolatry (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-2.htm">1 Kings 16:2</a>)<p>- Hard-hearted refusal to repent even after prophetic warning (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And had caused Israel to commit</b><p>Leadership multiplies influence. Like Jeroboam before them, Baasha and Elah institutionalized idol worship, dragging the whole nation along (<a href="/1_kings/12-30.htm">1 Kings 12:30</a>; 14:16). Scripture warns that causing others to sin brings severe accountability (<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>). Their policies normalized rebellion so that what was once shocking became ordinary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger</b><p>God&#8217;s anger is the settled, righteous opposition of His holy nature to evil (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). Israel was in covenant with &#8220;the LORD, the God of Israel,&#8221; a title that reminds readers of the Exodus deliverance and the Sinai covenant (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>). Persistent idolatry &#8220;provokes&#8221; Him&#8212;language used repeatedly to describe how sin stirs divine wrath (De 4:25; <a href="/psalms/78-58.htm">Psalm 78:58</a>). The anger is not capricious; it is covenantal, measured, and perfectly just.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With their worthless idols</b><p>The issue was not mere ritual preference but utter spiritual betrayal. Idols are called &#8220;worthless&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>) because they cannot see, hear, speak, or save (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>). By turning to lifeless images, Baasha, Elah, and Israel exchanged the glory of the living God for empty substitutes (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>).

Baasha and Elah personally rebelled, led the nation into the same sins, and provoked God by clinging to idols that could never satisfy. The verse stands as a sober reminder that God keeps His word, judges sin, and calls leaders and people alike to wholehearted allegiance to Him alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Vanities</span>--that is, <span class= "ital">idols</span> (as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm" title="They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-21.htm" title="And turn you not aside: for then should you go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.">1Samuel 12:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-6.htm" title="I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.">Psalm 31:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-29.htm" title="Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.">Isaiah 41:29</a>; Jer. viii 19; &c.): not only the idols of Dan and Bethel, but the worse abominations which grew up under cover of these.
