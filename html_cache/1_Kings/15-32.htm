This period was marked by frequent hostilities, as the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah often found themselves at odds. The term "war" here indicates not just isolated battles but a prolonged state of hostility and tension.<p><b>between Asa</b><br>Asa was the third king of Judah and is noted for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry. His reign is characterized by a commitment to the worship of Yahweh, contrasting with the practices of many of his predecessors. Asa's dedication to God is highlighted in <a href="/2_chronicles/14.htm">2 Chronicles 14-16</a>, where his reliance on divine guidance is emphasized, particularly during his early reign.<p><b>and Baasha king of Israel</b><br>Baasha was the third king of the northern kingdom of Israel, having come to power by overthrowing the previous king, Nadab, and exterminating the house of Jeroboam. His reign is marked by continued idolatry and opposition to the worship of Yahweh, as noted in <a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27-34</a>. Baasha's actions fulfilled the prophecy against Jeroboam's lineage, demonstrating the theme of divine justice.<p><b>throughout their days</b><br>The phrase indicates that the conflict persisted for the duration of both kings' reigns, suggesting a deep-seated enmity and political rivalry. This ongoing strife can be seen as a consequence of the initial division of the kingdom, which was a result of Solomon's disobedience to God. The continuous warfare also reflects the instability and challenges faced by both kingdoms in maintaining power and religious fidelity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>Asa was the king of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry.
