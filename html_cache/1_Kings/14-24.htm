These individuals were involved in ritualistic sexual acts as part of pagan worship, particularly in the service of fertility gods like Baal and Asherah. The presence of such practices in Israel indicates a significant departure from the worship of Yahweh, as these acts were explicitly condemned in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-17.htm">Deuteronomy 23:17-18</a>). The existence of these practices in the land reflects the influence of surrounding pagan cultures and the Israelites' failure to fully separate themselves from the idolatrous customs of the Canaanites.<p><b>They imitated all the abominations of the nations</b><br>This phrase underscores the extent to which the Israelites had adopted the detestable practices of the nations around them. The term "abominations" refers to actions that are abhorrent to God, often associated with idolatry and immorality. The Israelites' imitation of these practices signifies a breach of their covenant relationship with God, who had called them to be a holy and distinct people (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>). This imitation of pagan customs is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, leading to divine judgment and exile, as seen in the warnings of the prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9-10</a>).<p><b>the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.</b><br>This phrase recalls the conquest of Canaan, where God commanded the Israelites to drive out the inhabitants of the land due to their wickedness (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>). The Canaanites' practices were so corrupt that God used Israel as an instrument of judgment against them. However, the Israelites' adoption of these same practices demonstrates their failure to heed God's commands and maintain their distinctiveness. This failure ultimately led to their own judgment and exile, as foretold by Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63-68</a>).

There is a horrible significance in the derivation of this word, which is properly "consecrated," or "devoted;" for it indicates the license, and even the sanction, of unnatural lusts in those consecrated to the abominations of Nature-worship. The appearance of such in the land, whether Canaanites or apostate Israelites, is evidently noted as the climax of the infinite corruption which had set in, rivalling--and, if rivalling, exceeding in depth of wickedness--the abominations of the old inhabitants of the land. That such horrors are not incompatible with advance in knowledge and material civilisation, history tells us but too plainly.
