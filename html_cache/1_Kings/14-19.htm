His reign marked a significant shift in Israel's history, as he established a separate identity from Judah.

This act of idolatry had long-lasting spiritual consequences for Israel.<p><b>how he waged war</b><br>Jeroboam's reign was characterized by conflict, both internal and external.

These conflicts are indicative of the political instability that plagued the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah.<p><b>and how he reigned</b><br>Jeroboam's reign was marked by significant religious and political changes. He established a new religious system to rival that of Jerusalem, which included appointing non-Levitical priests and creating new religious festivals.

His exaltation and the promise to him, his idolatry and its punishment, are all that the historian cares to narrate. All else is summed up in the words "how he warred" (see below, <a href="/1_kings/14-30.htm" title="And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.">1Kings 14:30</a>, and <a href="/1_kings/15-6.htm" title="And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.">1Kings 15:6</a>) and "how he reigned." It is probable that his reign was prosperous enough in peace and war, though his attempt to subdue Judah failed. (See 2 Chronicles 13) But all this the Scriptural record passes over, and only commemorates him as "Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred</span> [see ver. 30; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> [As to this work, see Introduction, Section VI.
