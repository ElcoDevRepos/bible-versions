Omri's reign marked a significant political and military strength, but he also led Israel into idolatry. Ahab inherited this legacy and expanded upon it. The mention of Ahab as "son of Omri" highlights the continuation of a dynasty known for its departure from the worship of Yahweh. This sets the stage for Ahab's own actions and the spiritual decline of Israel.<p><b>did evil in the sight of the LORD</b><br>The phrase "did evil in the sight of the LORD" is a common biblical expression used to describe actions that are contrary to God's commandments and desires. Ahab's evil included promoting the worship of Baal, a Canaanite deity, and building altars for Baal in Samaria. This was a direct violation of the first commandment, which forbids the worship of other gods. Ahab's actions were not just politically motivated but were seen as a spiritual rebellion against the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>more than all who were before him</b><br>This phrase indicates that Ahab's actions were unprecedented in their wickedness. Previous kings of Israel had also committed sins, but Ahab's reign marked a new low in terms of idolatry and moral corruption. His marriage to Jezebel, a Phoenician princess and ardent worshiper of Baal, further exacerbated the situation, leading to widespread idolatry and persecution of the prophets of Yahweh. This comparison to previous kings underscores the severity of Ahab's sins and sets the stage for the prophetic confrontations with Elijah, who would challenge Ahab's apostasy and call Israel back to the worship of the true God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The son of Omri, Ahab became the king of Israel and is noted for his significant departure from the ways of the LORD, engaging in idolatry and leading Israel into sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/omri.htm">Omri</a></b><br>Ahab's father, who was also a king of Israel.

It is possible that the preceding verse has been revised by a chronologer. The LXX. text is much more condensed] did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him. [The same words are used of his father in ver. 25. It is not difficult to see in what way Ahab's rule was worse even than Omri's. The latter had gone beyond his predecessors in the matter of the calf worship. See note on ver. 25. But the calf worship, however it may have deteriorated in process of time - and it is the tendency of such systems to wax worse and worse - was nevertheless a cult, though a corrupt, and unauthorized, and illicit cultus, of the one true God. Under Ahab, however, positive idolatry was established and fostered the worship of foreign and shameful deities.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/16-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">However, Ahab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1447;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7717;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_256.htm">Strong's 256: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ahab -- 'father's brother', a king of Israel, also a false prophet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Omri</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6018.htm">Strong's 6018: </a> </span><span class="str2">Omri -- a king of Israel, also several other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
