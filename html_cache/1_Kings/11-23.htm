The term "raised up" suggests that God actively allowed or caused this adversary to come against Solomon, reflecting the consequences of Solomon's disobedience and idolatry. This is consistent with the biblical theme that God uses foreign nations or leaders to discipline His people (e.g., <a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>). The adversary is a tool in God's hands to fulfill His purposes, similar to how He used the Assyrians and Babylonians later in Israel's history.<p><b>Rezon the son of Eliada</b><br>Rezon is introduced as a significant figure who opposes Solomon. His lineage, being the son of Eliada, is mentioned, which was a common practice to establish identity and legitimacy. Rezon's opposition is part of the broader narrative of political unrest during Solomon's reign, which contrasts with the peace and prosperity earlier in his rule. This unrest foreshadows the eventual division of the kingdom after Solomon's death.<p><b>who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah</b><br>Rezon's background as a fugitive from Hadadezer, king of Zobah, provides historical context. Zobah was a significant Aramean kingdom located in modern-day Syria. This detail connects to earlier biblical accounts where David defeated Hadadezer (<a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3-8</a>), indicating ongoing tensions between Israel and surrounding nations. Rezon's flight suggests a personal vendetta against Israel, as he likely harbored resentment from David's earlier victories. This enmity is part of the larger narrative of Israel's complex relationships with neighboring states, which often involved shifting alliances and conflicts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rezon.htm">Rezon</a></b><br>Rezon was the son of Eliada and became an adversary to King Solomon.

Scripture consistently shows that when a king turns from obedience, God acts to correct him (<a href="/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11</a>).<p>- Solomon&#8217;s idolatry in the earlier part of the chapter invites divine discipline. The narrative makes it clear that political turbulence is not chance; it is God&#8217;s deliberate response to covenant violation (<a href="/1_kings/11-9.htm">1 Kings 11:9&#8211;13</a>).<p>- This reminds us that God remains sovereign over nations and rulers, directing history to uphold His righteousness (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>another adversary</b><p>- &#8220;Another&#8221; signals that Rezon is the second divinely appointed foe after Hadad the Edomite (<a href="/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a>). Multiple adversaries emphasize persistent correction rather than a single isolated incident.<p>- An &#8220;adversary&#8221; is one who opposes, frustrates, or harasses. In Solomon&#8217;s case, God uses external pressure to expose internal compromise (<a href="/1_kings/5-4.htm">1 Kings 5:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-41.htm">Psalm 106:41&#8211;42</a>).<p>- The pattern echoes what God later allows with Israel&#8217;s enemies when the nation drifts into idolatry (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rezon the son of Eliada</b><p>- By naming Rezon and his father, the text underlines that this was a real historical figure, not a symbol or myth.

God can elevate anyone He chooses to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>- Rezon eventually becomes king in Damascus (<a href="/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24&#8211;25</a>), posing a northern threat that foreshadows later Aramean conflicts with Israel (<a href="/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-8.htm">2 Kings 6:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah</b><p>- Rezon&#8217;s flight occurred during David&#8217;s campaigns against Hadadezer (<a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3&#8211;8</a>). While David&#8217;s victories dismantled Zobah&#8217;s power, they inadvertently set the stage for Rezon&#8217;s rise.<p>- The detail shows God working through the ripple effects of earlier events; nothing is random in His providence (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>- Rezon gathers men, becomes their leader, and occupies Damascus (<a href="/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a>). His grudge against Israel grows from personal exile into national hostility, illustrating how unchecked bitterness can shape entire kingdoms.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a> records God Himself stirring up Rezon to trouble Solomon.
