Tahpenes is identified as the queen or a high-ranking woman in Pharaoh's household, indicating Hadad's integration into Egyptian society. The birth of Genubath to Hadad, an Edomite prince, signifies the continuation of Hadad's lineage despite his exile. This connection to Egypt highlights the political alliances and familial ties that were common in the ancient Near East, where marriages often served to solidify alliances between nations. The name Genubath, meaning "theft" or "robbery," may reflect the circumstances of his birth or future actions, though the text does not elaborate further.<p><b>Tahpenes herself weaned him in Pharaoh&#8217;s palace,</b><br>The act of Tahpenes weaning Genubath in Pharaoh's palace underscores the privileged status of Hadad's family within Egypt. Weaning was a significant milestone in a child's life, often celebrated with a feast, and being weaned by a member of the royal household would have been a mark of honor and acceptance. This detail emphasizes the close relationship between Hadad and the Egyptian royal family, suggesting that Genubath was raised with the same care and attention as the Egyptian princes. It also reflects the cultural practice of wet-nursing and child-rearing in royal courts, where children of political significance were often raised in the palace to ensure loyalty and integration into the ruling class.<p><b>and Genubath lived there among the sons of Pharaoh.</b><br>Genubath's upbringing among the sons of Pharaoh indicates his assimilation into the Egyptian royal family, providing him with a unique position of influence and education. This environment would have exposed him to the political, cultural, and religious practices of Egypt, potentially shaping his future actions and loyalties. Living among Pharaoh's sons suggests that Genubath was considered part of the royal household, which could have implications for his identity and future role in regional politics. This setting also foreshadows the complex relationships between Israel and Egypt, as seen throughout the biblical narrative, where Egypt often plays a dual role as both refuge and adversary.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tahpenes.htm">Tahpenes</a></b><br>An Egyptian queen, wife of Pharaoh, who played a role in the upbringing of Genubath.

Tahpenes&#8212;likely Pharaoh&#8217;s chief wife&#8212;acts as royal foster-mother, mirroring Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter drawing Moses from the Nile (<a href="/exodus/2-5.htm">Exodus 2:5&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; Weaning marked the transition from fragile infancy to stable childhood; celebrations surrounded it (<a href="/genesis/21-8.htm">Genesis 21:8</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-23.htm">1 Samuel 1:23&#8211;28</a>). Genubath&#8217;s weaning inside the palace underlines his protected status.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s providence sometimes shelters future adversaries in unexpected places, just as Joseph thrived in Egypt before confronting his brothers (<a href="/genesis/45-4.htm">Genesis 45:4&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Genubath lived there among the sons of Pharaoh</b><p>&#8226; Growing up alongside royal princes assures Genubath of elite education, military training, and political networking (compare <a href="/acts/7-22.htm">Acts 7:22</a> on Moses learning &#8220;all the wisdom of the Egyptians&#8221;).<p>&#8226; This detail foreshadows continued tensions between Israel and Edom. An Edomite prince with Egyptian grooming becomes a ready instrument once Solomon&#8217;s kingdom begins to fracture (<a href="/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse quietly shows the ripple effect of Solomon&#8217;s earlier compromise with foreign alliances (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1&#8211;4</a>).

Through the royal favor of Tahpenes, Genubath receives privilege and preparation that will later fuel opposition against Israel. The verse highlights the literal unfolding of God&#8217;s warning that foreign entanglements breed future trouble, affirming His precise control over history and His faithfulness to uphold both blessing and judgment revealed in Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Genubath</span> is similarly unknown.
