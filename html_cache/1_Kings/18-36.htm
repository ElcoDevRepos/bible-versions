The evening sacrifice was a significant part of the daily worship in the temple, occurring around 3 PM. This time was traditionally associated with prayer and sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a> and <a href="/acts/3.htm">Acts 3:1</a>. Elijah's choice to act at this time underscores the connection to the worship practices of Israel and highlights the contrast between the true worship of Yahweh and the false worship of Baal.<p><b>Elijah the prophet approached the altar</b><br>Elijah's role as a prophet is central to this narrative. Prophets in Israel were God's messengers, often calling the people back to covenant faithfulness. The altar, which Elijah repaired earlier in the chapter, symbolizes the restoration of true worship. This act of approaching the altar signifies Elijah's boldness and faith in God, as well as his role as an intercessor for the people.<p><b>and said, &#8220;O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel</b><br>By invoking the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Elijah appeals to the covenantal relationship God established with the patriarchs. This invocation serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the promises made to the forefathers of Israel. It also distinguishes Yahweh from Baal, emphasizing the continuity of worship from the patriarchs to the present.<p><b>let it be known this day that You are God in Israel</b><br>Elijah's prayer is a plea for God to reveal Himself as the one true God. This request is not just for the benefit of the Israelites but also as a testimony to the surrounding nations. The demonstration of God's power would affirm His sovereignty and supremacy over all other deities, fulfilling the prophetic role of making God's name known among the nations.<p><b>and that I am Your servant</b><br>Elijah identifies himself as God's servant, highlighting his obedience and submission to God's will. This declaration underscores the prophet's role as a mediator between God and the people, acting not on his own authority but under divine commission. It also serves to validate Elijah's actions as being directed by God.<p><b>and have done all these things at Your command</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Elijah's obedience to God's instructions. The events leading up to this moment, including the confrontation with the prophets of Baal, were carried out in accordance with God's will. This obedience is a key theme in the lives of the prophets and is a model for faithfulness to God's commands. Elijah's actions serve as a type of Christ, who also acted in complete obedience to the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who played a crucial role in challenging the idolatry of Israel and demonstrating the power of the one true God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The place where Elijah offered a sacrifice to God, symbolizing worship and dedication.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often struggling with faithfulness to Him amidst surrounding pagan influences.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_evening_sacrifice.htm">The Evening Sacrifice</a></b><br>A specific time of day for offering sacrifices, highlighting the importance of worship and obedience to God's timing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_prayer.htm">Faithfulness in Prayer</a></b><br>Elijah's prayer at the altar demonstrates the importance of approaching God with faith and confidence.

In His own nature incomprehensible to finite being, He yet reveals Himself in moral and spiritual relations with His people, through which they "know that which passeth knowledge." The prominence of the name "Jehovah," thrice repeated in this short prayer of Elijah, is significant as of the special mission, symbolised in his very name, s<span class= "ital">o </span>also of his immediate purpose. He desires to efface himself. The God of Israel is to show Himself as the true worker, not only in the outer sphere by miracle, but in the inner sphere by that conversion of the hearts of the people, which to the prophet's eye is already effected. Like his antitype in the New Testament, Elijah is but a voice calling on men "to prepare the way of the Lord."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice</span> [see note on ver. 29], that Elijah the prophet [this designation of Elijah is unusual.
