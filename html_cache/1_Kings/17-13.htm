This phrase indicates a divine intervention where God, through His prophet, provides comfort and assurance. Elijah, a prophet during the reign of King Ahab, speaks with authority, representing God's voice. The context is a time of severe drought and famine, which Elijah himself had prophesied (<a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>). The widow, living in Zarephath, a region outside Israel, would have been particularly vulnerable, highlighting God's care for all people, not just Israelites.<p><b>&#8220;Go and do as you have said.&#8221;</b><br>Elijah acknowledges the widow's plan to prepare a last meal for herself and her son, showing respect for her intentions. This phrase suggests a test of faith, as she is asked to act on Elijah's instructions despite her dire circumstances. It parallels other biblical instances where faith is demonstrated through obedience, such as Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2-3</a>).<p><b>But first make me a small cake of bread from what you have,</b><br>Elijah's request for a small cake of bread is significant. It symbolizes a test of faith and prioritization of God's word over immediate needs. The act of giving to God's prophet first is an act of faith, reminiscent of the principle of firstfruits, where the first and best are offered to God (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>). This request challenges the widow to trust in God's provision.<p><b>and bring it out to me.</b><br>The instruction to bring the bread to Elijah emphasizes the act of service and obedience. It reflects the cultural practice of hospitality, which was highly valued in ancient Near Eastern societies. This act of bringing the bread signifies a step of faith, trusting that God will provide despite the widow's limited resources.<p><b>Afterward, make some for yourself and your son,</b><br>Elijah assures the widow that there will be enough for her and her son after she fulfills his request. This promise foreshadows the miracle of provision that follows, where the widow's jar of flour and jug of oil do not run dry (<a href="/1_kings/17-14.htm">1 Kings 17:14-16</a>). It highlights God's faithfulness and the principle that when one gives to God, He provides abundantly in return (<a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>). This narrative also prefigures Christ's miracles of provision, such as the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>), illustrating God's power to provide beyond natural means.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God, known for his faith and obedience.

Throughout Scripture God confronts fear with His promise of provision (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-33</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith always begins with turning from fear to trust. Like Joshua on the edge of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>), the widow is invited to shift her gaze from empty supplies to the living God who never fails.<p>&#8226; Notice that the command precedes the miracle. God&#8217;s word precedes God&#8217;s work, teaching us that obedience anchored in trust unlocks divine provision (<a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Elijah said to her&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The prophet speaks as God&#8217;s authorized messenger. His words carry the same weight as God&#8217;s own promise (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; In a region dominated by Baal worship, Elijah represents the one true God who alone controls rain, harvest, and life (<a href="/1_kings/18-39.htm">1 Kings 18:39</a>).<p>&#8226; By listening to Elijah, the widow aligns herself with the covenant-keeping Lord, illustrating <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>&#8212;&#8220;faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Go and do as you have said&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Elijah affirms her plan to use the last of her flour and oil, yet he reframes it under divine direction. God often works through our ordinary duties&#8212;mixing dough, feeding family&#8212;to unveil His extraordinary power (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience is not passive waiting but active faith. Like Naaman washing in the Jordan (<a href="/2_kings/5-10.htm">2 Kings 5:10-14</a>), the widow&#8217;s simple action becomes the arena for God&#8217;s intervention.<p>&#8226; The assurance embedded here: God is not asking her to ignore reality; He is asking her to trust Him within it (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;But first make me a small cake of bread from what you have, and bring it out to me&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;But first&#8221; introduces the principle of putting God&#8217;s claim ahead of personal need. Compare the widow of Sidon with the boy who offered five loaves and two fish (<a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9-11</a>). In both cases, giving to God first precedes abundance.<p>&#8226; The request sounds audacious, yet it invites her into covenant blessing: <a href="/1_kings/17-14.htm">1 Kings 17:14</a> immediately follows with God&#8217;s promise that the jar and jug will not run dry.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway:<p>&#8211; God seeks our first portion, not our leftovers (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>).<p>&#8211; He tests the heart, not because He needs the food, but because He desires our faith (<a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>).<p>&#8211; Small acts of surrender invite large demonstrations of grace (<a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Afterward, make some for yourself and your son&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s order assures personal provision only after honoring His priority.

When the order is God first, abundance follows&#8212;for Elijah, the widow, and for all who take Him at His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elijah said unto her</span> [This looks at first like a further test. But it is pretty clear that the prophet now knew that the widow of whom God had spoken was before him], Fear not; go and do as <span class="cmt_word">thou</span> hast said [Heb. <span class="accented">according to Shy word</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>but</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">only, however</span>]: make me <span class="cmt_word">thereof</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">thence, i.e.</span>, of the oil as well as the meal. The former took the place of butter. Bread was sometimes baked in oil] a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and thy son. [The "first" and "afterwards" are emphatic by position. When Bahr says that Elijah would never have made this demand, and that still less would the widow have paid any attention to it, had she been a heathen, he appears to forget the words that followed (ver. 14). When one in the garb of a prophet swore, as this man did, by the sacred name, a heathen, with the belief of the heathen in miracles, might well be persuaded that the word was truth. Elijah's manner alone would carry conviction with it.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/17-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">be afraid,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#238;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3372.htm">Strong's 3372: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fear, to revere, caus, to frighten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Elijah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1433;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;l&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_452.htm">Strong's 452: </a> </span><span class="str2">Elijah -- 'Yah is God', a well-known prophet of Israel, also three other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
