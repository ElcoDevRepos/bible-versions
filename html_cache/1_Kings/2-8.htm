His lineage as the son of Gera places him within the context of the Benjamite tribe, which had historical tensions with the tribe of Judah, from which David hailed. This tension is rooted in the rivalry between Saul, the first king of Israel from the tribe of Benjamin, and David. Shimei's actions and David's instructions to Solomon highlight the ongoing political and tribal complexities in Israel.<p><b>the Benjamite from Bahurim who is with you</b><br>Bahurim is a village in the territory of Benjamin, located near the Mount of Olives. It is mentioned in several biblical accounts, including the story of David's flight from Absalom. The geographical location of Bahurim is significant as it was a place of refuge and conflict. Shimei's presence in Solomon's court suggests a continued political alliance or oversight, reflecting the delicate balance of power and the need for vigilance in maintaining the kingdom's unity.<p><b>He called down bitter curses against me on the day I went to Mahanaim</b><br>This refers to the incident recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-13</a>, where Shimei cursed David as he fled from his son Absalom. Mahanaim, a city east of the Jordan River, served as a refuge for David during Absalom's rebellion. The act of cursing a king was a serious offense, reflecting deep-seated animosity and the political instability of the time. Shimei's actions were not only personal but also symbolic of the broader dissent against David's rule.<p><b>but when he came down to meet me at the Jordan</b><br>After Absalom's defeat, Shimei sought forgiveness from David as he returned to Jerusalem, crossing the Jordan River. This act of contrition at the Jordan, a significant geographical and spiritual boundary in Israel's history, symbolizes repentance and the hope for reconciliation. The Jordan River often represents transitions and new beginnings, as seen in the Israelites' crossing into the Promised Land and Jesus' baptism.<p><b>I swore to him by the LORD: &#8216;I will never put you to the sword.&#8217;</b><br>David's oath to Shimei, invoking the name of the LORD, underscores the seriousness and binding nature of his promise. In the ancient Near Eastern context, oaths were sacred and often irrevocable. David's decision to spare Shimei reflects his merciful character and reliance on divine justice. However, this mercy is tempered by the need for Solomon to address potential threats to the kingdom, illustrating the tension between personal forgiveness and political prudence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shimei_son_of_gera.htm">Shimei son of Gera</a></b><br>A Benjamite from Bahurim who cursed King David during Absalom's rebellion.

The verse highlights the balance between mercy and accountability, the sanctity of oaths, and the requirement that rulers guard the kingdom against persistent sin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Thou hast with thee Shimei</span>.--The most ungenerous charge is the virtual withdrawal of the pardon, freely granted to Shimei long before (<a href="/context/2_samuel/19-18.htm" title="And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;">2Samuel 19:18-23</a>). It is, perhaps, partly dictated by policy; for the notice of Shimei (<a href="/context/2_samuel/16-5.htm" title="And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.">2Samuel 16:5-8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-17.htm" title="And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.">2Samuel 19:17</a>) shows that he was powerful, and that he assumed a dangerous championship of the fallen house of Saul. But there are unmistakable traces of the old grudge rankling in David's heart, reminding us of the bitterness of such psalms as Psalms 69.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, thou hast with thee</span> [Bahr understands by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>, "near thee," (<span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">deiner Nahe</span>) because Bahurim was near Jerusalem. Keil gathers from this word that Shimei "was living at that time in Jerusalem," and refers to ver. 36, which, if anything, implies that he was not. But it is worth suggesting whether Shimei may not be the Shimei to whom reference is made in <a href="/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8</a>. (Dean Stanley notices this as a possibility, but alleges nothing in support of it: "Jewish Church," vol. 2 p. 171, note.) We there find Shimei and Rei mentioned as firm adherents of Solomon at the time of Adonijah's rising, and in these words, they "were not <span class="accented">with Adonijah."</span> Surely it is not an unfair presumption - if there is nothing to rebut it - that the Shimei subsequently mentioned as "with" Solomon is the same person. But it has been objected (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, by Kitto) that the false part that Shimei played at the time of Absalom's revolt would have forever prevented his being recognized and mentioned as one of Solomon's supporters. I very much doubt it. The great influence which Shimei possessed must be taken into account. Nothing shows that influence more clearly than the fact that on the day of David's restoration, despite the part he had taken, and the possible disgrace and danger that awaited him, he could still command the attendance of one thousand men of Benjamin (<a href="/2_samuel/19-17.htm">2 Samuel 19:17</a>). Probably the secret of his influence lay in the fact that he was "of the family of the house of Saul," and possibly, owing to the insignificance of Saul's descendants, was the mainstay and chief representative of that house. And if so, there is nothing at all surprising in the mention of the fact that he was "not with Adonijah," and was subsequently "with" Solomon. It may have been a matter of great consequence at that critical time, which side Shimei - and the thousand or more Benjamites at his back - espoused. And if he <span class="accented">did</span> then declare for Solomon, it could hardly fail to procure him some amount of favour and consideration. He would thenceforward rank amongst the friends of the young king, and the words "thou hast with thee" would accurately describe his position] <span class="cmt_word">Shimei, the son of Gera</span> [another Shimei, the son of Elah, is mentioned (<a href="/1_kings/4-11.htm">1 Kings 4:11</a>) as Solomon's officer <span class="accented">in Benjamin.</span> Gera must not be thought of as the "father" of Shimei, except in the sense of ancestor. He was removed from him by many generations, being the son of Bela and the grandson of Benjamin (<a href="/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>; cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/7-6.htm">1 Chronicles 7:6</a>). Ehud, three hundred years earlier, is also described as "a son of Gera," <a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>], <span class="cmt_word">a Benjamite</span> [lit., <span class="accented">the</span> Benjamite, meaning that Gera, not Shimei, was the Benjamite. He was well known as the son of Benjamin's firstborn (<a href="/1_chronicles/8.htm">1 Chronicles 8</a>:l), and the head of a house in Benjamin. Professor Gardiner (American translation of Lange, textual note, p. 29), following the LXX. and Vulg., insists that, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (with the article) can only mean "son of the Jaminite, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of the descendants of Jamin, a son of Simeon." But this is directly contrary to what we read 9 <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16</a>, viz., that Shimei was of "a family of the house of Saul," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a Benjamite. And to this the grammar agrees. <a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a> is an exact parallel, and compare <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <a href="/1_samuel/6-14.htm">1 Samuel 6:14, 18</a>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1, 18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-58.htm">1 Samuel 17:58</a>] of Bahurim [the name means "<span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">young men</span>." It was some six miles distant from Jerusalem, in Benjamin, and on (or off, as Josephus, Ant. 7:09, 7, implies) the main road to Jericho and the Jordan valley. It may have lain in one of the waddies branching out from the ravine which runs continuously alongside the steep descent to Jericho. The event narrated in <a href="/2_samuel/3-16.htm">2 Samuel 3:16</a> as happening at Bahurim may well have served to inflame Shimei's hatred.
