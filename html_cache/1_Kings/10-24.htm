His reputation for wisdom and wealth had spread far beyond the borders of Israel, attracting people from various nations. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Solomon in <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>, where God granted him unparalleled wisdom. The phrase "the whole world" is hyperbolic, indicating a vast number of people from different regions, not literally every person on earth. This global interest in Solomon prefigures the universal reign of Christ, who is described as the "greater than Solomon" in <a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>.<p><b>to hear the wisdom</b><br>Solomon's wisdom was not merely intellectual but divinely inspired, encompassing understanding, discernment, and the ability to govern justly. His wisdom was demonstrated in various ways, including his judicial decisions, such as the famous case of the two women claiming the same baby (<a href="/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16-28</a>), and his extensive writings, including Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon. This wisdom is a type of Christ, who is the embodiment of divine wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24, 30</a>).<p><b>that God had put in his heart</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin of Solomon's wisdom. It was not acquired through human means but was a gift from God, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5-14</a>, where Solomon asks for an understanding heart to govern the people. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including mind, will, and emotions. This divine endowment points to the New Covenant promise where God writes His laws on the hearts of His people (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>), fulfilled in Christ, who imparts wisdom to believers through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.

Solomon&#8217;s worldwide draw shows an early taste of that promise fulfilled.<p>&#8226; This phrase hints at the universal longing for truth that only God can satisfy, paving the way for Isaiah&#8217;s vision that &#8220;all nations&#8221; will stream to the Lord&#8217;s house (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sought an audience with Solomon</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;sought an audience with Solomon&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Kings, queens, merchants, and scholars traveled great distances (<a href="/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1-2</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>).<p>&#8226; Their pursuit underscores that genuine wisdom invites investigation, not blind acceptance (<a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene illustrates <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>&#8212;&#8220;Do you see a man skilled in his work?

Solomon&#8217;s court became a classroom where nations learned God-centered discernment.<p>&#8226; Their motive was hearing, not merely observing wealth, showing that true riches are found in understanding (<a href="/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That God had put in his heart</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;that God had put in his heart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The source is divine.
