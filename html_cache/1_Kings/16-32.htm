His actions marked a significant departure from the worship of Yahweh, the God of Israel. The setting up of an altar for Baal indicates a formal establishment of Baal worship, which was a Canaanite deity associated with fertility and storms. This act was a direct violation of the first commandment, which forbids the worship of other gods (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). Ahab's marriage to Jezebel, a Phoenician princess, further influenced his religious practices, as she was a fervent worshiper of Baal. This introduction of Baal worship led to a spiritual decline in Israel, setting the stage for the confrontation between Elijah and the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18).<p><b>in the temple of Baal</b><br>The construction of a temple for Baal in Israel was unprecedented and signified a state-sponsored endorsement of idolatry. Temples were central to ancient Near Eastern religious practices, serving as places of worship and sacrifice. The presence of a temple dedicated to Baal in Israel highlights the extent of Ahab's apostasy. This temple would have been a place where rituals and sacrifices were conducted, drawing the people of Israel away from the worship of Yahweh. The building of such a temple was a fulfillment of the warnings given by the prophets about the consequences of turning away from God (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-29.htm">Deuteronomy 12:29-31</a>).<p><b>that he had built in Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, established by Ahab's father, Omri. The choice of Samaria as the location for the temple of Baal underscores the political and religious significance of the city. By building the temple in the capital, Ahab was making a bold statement about the centrality of Baal worship in his administration. This act of building a temple in Samaria can be seen as a strategic move to consolidate power and unify the kingdom under a common religious practice, albeit one that was contrary to the covenantal faith of Israel. The city of Samaria would later become a focal point of prophetic condemnation due to its idolatry and injustice (<a href="/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The seventh king of Israel, known for his evil reign and idolatry.

After marrying Jezebel and &#8220;going to serve and worship Baal&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>), Ahab&#8217;s next move is to institutionalize that worship.<p>&#8226; Scripture often spotlights the first step of rebellion to underscore accountability, as seen when Jeroboam &#8220;made two golden calves&#8221; at the outset of his reign (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; By noting this initial action, the writer shows how a king&#8217;s choices set the spiritual tone for the whole nation (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ahab set up an altar for Baal</b><p>&#8226; An altar is the centerpiece of worship. By erecting it, Ahab replaces the LORD&#8217;s altar (<a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>) with one devoted to a pagan deity, breaking the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Building a rival altar directly defies God&#8217;s order to &#8220;destroy all their altars&#8221; upon entering the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The public nature of this act legitimizes idolatry for Israel, much like Manasseh&#8217;s later altar to &#8220;all the host of heaven&#8221; in the temple courts (<a href="/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the temple of Baal</b><p>&#8226; Ahab does more than adopt a foreign altar; he constructs a full-scale sanctuary. This mirrors Sidonian practice (<a href="/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5, 33</a>) and rivals the LORD&#8217;s temple in Jerusalem.<p>&#8226; By giving Baal a dedicated house, Ahab grants the idol permanent, honored space, echoing Pharaoh&#8217;s hardened resolve (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The structure will become a flashpoint for judgment when Jehu later &#8220;demolished the temple of Baal and made it a latrine&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/10-26.htm">2 Kings 10:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that he had built</b><p>&#8226; The text stresses Ahab&#8217;s personal initiative. He funds, orders, and oversees the project, making him the chief architect of Israel&#8217;s apostasy.<p>&#8226; Leaders bear heightened responsibility; Jeroboam similarly &#8220;made priests from all the people, who were not Levites&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>), and God held him accountable for every resulting sin (<a href="/1_kings/14-16.htm">1 Kings 14:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Ahab&#8217;s deliberate construction contrasts with the LORD&#8217;s command that any sanctuary be built only where He chooses (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in Samaria</b><p>&#8226; Samaria, the capital Ahab&#8217;s father Omri established (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>), is Israel&#8217;s political heart. Planting Baal worship there embeds idolatry at the nation&#8217;s core.<p>&#8226; The city later falls to the Assyrians because the people &#8220;worshiped all the host of heaven and served Baal&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Centuries afterward, Jesus meets a Samaritan woman whose ancestors still debate true worship locations (<a href="/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20-22</a>), showing the long shadow cast by Ahab&#8217;s choice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Ahab&#8217;s step-by-step actions&#8212;beginning, building, and entrenching Baal worship in Samaria&#8212;mark a calculated rejection of the LORD&#8217;s covenant. By constructing an altar and temple for a foreign god at the nation&#8217;s epicenter, he leads Israel into open, organized idolatry and sets the stage for severe judgment. <a href="/1_kings/16-32.htm">1 Kings 16:32</a> therefore stands as a sober reminder that leadership decisions toward or away from God carry profound, generational consequences.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he reared up an altar for Baal in</span> [Heb. omits <span class="accented">in</span>; cf. <a href="/1_kings/15-15.htm">1 Kings 15:15</a>, etc.] <span class="cmt_word">the house of Baal</span> [A temple, we can hardly doubt, of considerable splendour.
