The man of God, who had been sent from Judah to Bethel to deliver a message against the altar, was initially instructed by God not to eat or drink in that place. His disobedience to this command, influenced by the old prophet's deception, highlights the importance of adhering to God's word. This act of eating and drinking symbolizes a breach of divine instruction, reminiscent of other biblical instances where disobedience leads to consequences, such as Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>the old prophet who had brought him back</b><br>The old prophet from Bethel plays a crucial role in this narrative. His actions are pivotal, as he deceives the man of God by claiming to have received a word from an angel, which contradicts the original command given to the man of God. This highlights the theme of false prophecy and the danger of being led astray by those who claim divine authority. The old prophet's actions serve as a warning against false teachings and emphasize the need for discernment, as echoed in passages like 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>, which advises believers to test the spirits.<p><b>saddled the donkey for him</b><br>Saddling the donkey signifies preparation for a journey, indicating that the man of God is about to leave Bethel. In biblical times, donkeys were common means of transportation, symbolizing humility and service. This act of the old prophet saddling the donkey can be seen as an ironic gesture of hospitality, given the deception that has occurred. The donkey, as a mode of transport, also connects to other biblical narratives, such as Balaam's donkey in <a href="/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22</a>, which serves as a vehicle for divine intervention and revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>A prophet from Judah sent by God to deliver a message to King Jeroboam in Bethel.

The Spirit records this to show that deception, even from religious insiders, is real (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word remains unchanged despite manipulative voices; the episode illustrates <a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5&#8211;6</a>: &#8220;Every word of God is flawless &#8230; do not add to His words.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saddled the donkey for him</b><p>&#8226; Acts of service can mask earlier sin. The old prophet looks helpful, but his courtesy cannot cancel the damage already done (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; The donkey becomes the vehicle carrying the man of God toward inevitable discipline (<a href="/1_kings/13-24.htm">1 Kings 13:24</a>), showing that outward convenience can speed the consequences of inner compromise.<p>&#8226; The verse closes quietly, but the next steps are grave&#8212;a sober reminder that delayed judgment is still certain (<a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/13-23.htm">1 Kings 13:23</a> is more than narrative detail; it is a hinge between disobedience and divine discipline. After openly breaking God&#8217;s command, the man of God is escorted back on a donkey prepared by the very deceiver who lured him. The scene spotlights the seriousness of listening to any voice above Scripture, however sincere or respectful it appears. God&#8217;s Word stands fixed; when we choose another authority, even small steps like a shared meal can set us on a path toward loss and regret.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the prophet of Bethel; the "man of God" would seem to have come on foot. See below] <span class="cmt_word">for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.</span> This translation is inadmissible. For not only is the term "prophet" throughout this narrative restricted to the prophet of Bethel (the prophet of Judah being always spoken of as "the man of God,") but the expression here used <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d4;</span> is also twice used (vers. 20, 26) of the same prophet. He is characterized there, that is to say, as "the prophet which brought him back;" it is hardly likely, therefore, that the same words are here to be interpreted, "the prophet whom he brought back." The mistake has arisen from the proximity of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> ("for him") to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span> ("to" or "for the prophet"). But the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>is here indicative of possession (the dative of the possessor), as in <a href="/1_samuel/14-16.htm">1 Samuel 14:16</a>, "the watchmen to," <span class="accented">i.e., of</span>, "Saul," and <a href="/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a>, "a son to Jesse" (cf. <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a> Heb.; 1 Kings 5:29 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 5:15<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span> Heb.; Ruth 2:3 Heb.) We must therefore render "He (the old prophet, but this is not absolutely certain; the "man of God" <span class="accented">may</span> be understood) saddled for him (the man of God) the ass of the prophet which brought him back." The man of God had been delayed by his return to Bethel, and the prophet, out of pity, lends or gives him his ass. Not merely, it is probable, for the sake of speeding him on his way, but that he might have some living thing with him on a journey which he had so much cause to dread. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/13-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
