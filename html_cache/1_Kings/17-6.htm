Despite this, God uses these birds to sustain Elijah, demonstrating His sovereignty and ability to provide through unexpected means. This miraculous provision highlights God's care for His prophets and His power over creation. The provision of bread and meat is reminiscent of God's provision of manna and quail to the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 16), showing continuity in God's faithfulness to His people. This act also prefigures the miraculous feeding of the multitudes by Jesus (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>), where He provides bread and fish, further illustrating God's provision through Christ.<p><b>in the morning and evening</b><br>The regularity of the provision underscores God's reliability and faithfulness. Morning and evening offerings were a part of the daily worship in the temple (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-39</a>), suggesting a rhythm of divine provision that aligns with worship and devotion. This timing also reflects the structure of daily life in ancient Israel, where morning and evening were significant times for prayer and reflection. The consistency of God's provision for Elijah serves as a reminder of His unchanging nature and His promise to meet the needs of His servants.<p><b>and he would drink from the brook</b><br>The brook Cherith, where Elijah was sent, is believed to be located east of the Jordan River. This geographical detail places Elijah in a remote and secluded area, away from the reach of King Ahab and Jezebel, who sought his life. The brook represents God's natural provision, complementing the supernatural provision of food by the ravens. This setting emphasizes Elijah's dependence on God alone for sustenance and protection. The drying up of the brook later in the narrative (<a href="/1_kings/17-7.htm">1 Kings 17:7</a>) serves as a transition to the next phase of God's plan for Elijah, illustrating the temporary nature of earthly provisions and the need to continually trust in God's guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God, Elijah is central to this passage.

He is not stingy; He gives variety and fullness.<p>&#8226; The scene echoes <a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4, 13</a>, where bread (manna) and meat (quail) rained down for Israel, and <a href="/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a> notes they ate &#8220;bread of angels.&#8221; Elijah receives the same covenant care.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/19-6.htm">1 Kings 19:6</a> shows another occasion when God sends bread and water to Elijah; physical nourishment is repeatedly tied to renewed spiritual strength.<p>&#8226; Every slice of bread and portion of meat testifies that God&#8217;s Word of promise (17:4) is as tangible as the food in Elijah&#8217;s hands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the morning and evening</b><p>&#8226; Provision comes twice daily, establishing a dependable rhythm. God does not simply rescue once; He maintains continual, covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/16-8.htm">Exodus 16:8</a> foretold Israel would have meat &#8220;in the evening and bread&#8230; in the morning.&#8221; That pattern reappears here, linking Elijah to the wilderness generation.<p>&#8226; The timing mirrors the believer&#8217;s daily dependence: <a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a> says, &#8220;Morning, noon, and night, I cry out&#8230;,&#8221; while <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a> proclaims mercies &#8220;new every morning.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Elijah wakes and rests with evidence that the Lord&#8217;s compassions never fail, encouraging us to seek God at both ends of every day.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he would drink</b><p>&#8226; Food alone is incomplete; &#8220;he would drink&#8221; shows total care. Water, scarce in this drought, is God&#8217;s gift just as vital as the bread and meat.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a> pictures the Shepherd leading His own &#8220;beside quiet waters,&#8221; and <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a> invites the thirsty to &#8220;come to the waters.&#8221; Elijah lives that invitation literally.<p>&#8226; The motif points forward to Jesus&#8217; promise, &#8220;Whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>). Physical drink at Cherith foreshadows the spiritual satisfaction found in Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the brook</b><p>&#8226; The brook itself is a natural, not supernatural, source&#8212;God uses both miraculous (ravens) and ordinary (water) means together.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/33-16.htm">Isaiah 33:16</a> assures the righteous that &#8220;his bread will be given him, and his water assured.&#8221; Elijah experiences that assurance firsthand.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8-9</a> speaks of drinking &#8220;from Your river of delights&#8221;; even a small brook becomes a river of God&#8217;s kindness when He appoints it for His servant.<p>&#8226; The location also teaches readiness to move when the brook later dries (17:7); trust is placed in the Provider, not the provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/17-6.htm">1 Kings 17:6</a> records a literal, historical moment in which God miraculously fed Elijah by ravens and sustained him with water from a brook. The verse displays God&#8217;s sovereign command over creation, His generous and regular provision, and His invitation to daily trust. In famine or plenty, the Lord faithfully supplies every need of those who obey His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - And the ravens brought [Heb. <span class="accented">bringing</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening</span> [the Vat.

But if we may believe that the prophet was, if not among kinsmen or friends, yet among the pastoral, semi-nomadic people of Gilead, a people, that is to say, like the Bedawin in their instincts and customs, it is easy to understand that having taken him under their protection, they would make a point of visiting him regularly, not only to show him all possible honour, as a person endued with supernatural powers (cf. <a href="/1_kings/18-7.htm">1 Kings 18:7, 13</a>), but to afford him some measure of sympathy and companionship.
