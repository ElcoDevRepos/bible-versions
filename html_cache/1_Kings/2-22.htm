His mother, Bathsheba, holds a position of influence, as seen in her approach to Solomon. This reflects the cultural respect for maternal authority in the royal family. Solomon's response to his mother shows both respect and assertiveness, indicating his awareness of the political implications of her request.<p><b>&#8220;Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah?</b><br>Abishag was a young woman who served King David in his old age. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, taking a king's concubine or wife was often seen as a claim to the throne. Adonijah, Solomon's older brother, had previously attempted to usurp the throne (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5-10</a>). Solomon perceives this request as a political maneuver, potentially threatening his reign.<p><b>Since he is my older brother,</b><br>Adonijah being the older brother gives him a natural claim to the throne in the eyes of many, as primogeniture was a common practice. However, God chose Solomon to succeed David (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5-6</a>), highlighting the divine right over traditional customs.<p><b>you might as well request the kingdom for him</b><br>Solomon's statement underscores the gravity of the request. Granting Adonijah Abishag could be interpreted as endorsing his claim to the throne. This reflects the political tension and the fragile nature of Solomon's early reign.<p><b>and for Abiathar the priest</b><br>Abiathar was a priest who initially supported Adonijah's claim to the throne (<a href="/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7</a>). Mentioning him here suggests that Solomon sees a coalition forming against him. Abiathar's later removal from the priesthood fulfills the prophecy against the house of Eli (<a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31-35</a>).<p><b>and for Joab son of Zeruiah!&#8221;</b><br>Joab, David's military commander, also supported Adonijah (<a href="/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7</a>). His mention indicates the potential for military support for Adonijah's claim. Joab's eventual execution by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28-34</a>) signifies the consolidation of Solomon's power and the fulfillment of David's instructions (<a href="/1_kings/2-5.htm">1 Kings 2:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the newly anointed king of Israel, known for his wisdom and understanding.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>Solomon's older half-brother who previously attempted to claim the throne before Solomon was anointed king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abishag_the_shunammite.htm">Abishag the Shunammite</a></b><br>A young woman who served King David in his old age.

A king&#8217;s harem carried royal authority, so the request, though spoken by Bathsheba, was a direct challenge to God&#8217;s choice of Solomon. By grouping Adonijah with Abiathar and Joab, Solomon identifies the full scope of the threat and acts decisively to preserve the kingdom&#8217;s God-given order.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">And why dost thou ask?--</span>In Solomon's answer there is a certain bitterness, venting itself in irony, which seems to argue the mingling with kingly dignity and policy of some passionate feeling, not unlike the bursts of passion in his father, as in the case of Nabal (<a href="/context/1_samuel/25-21.htm" title="Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him: and he has requited me evil for good.">1Samuel 25:21-22</a>). It certainly gives some probability to the conjecture (see Note on 1:3) that Abishag was the "fair Shulamite" of the Song of Solomon, already loved by the youthful king. In his wrath he infers, rightly or wrongly, that the hand of the conspirators is seen in this petition, and executes vengeance accordingly, summarily and without giving them any trial or opportunity of excusing themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask</span> <span class="cmt_word">Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah?</span> [Professor Plumptre (Dict. Bib., art. "Solomon") says this "narrative is not a little perplexing." He then specially remarks on the strangeness of Bathsheba's interceding for Adonijah, and also on Solomon's "flashing into fiercest wrath" at her request. He explains the facts, however, by "Mr. Grove's ingenious theory identifying Abishag with the Shulamite (<a href="/songs/6-13.htm">Song of Solomon 6:13</a>), the heroine of the Song of Songs." It is "the passionate love of Solomon for the fairest among women' that has made Bathsheba, "hitherto supreme, to fear a rival influence, and to join in any scheme for its removal." The king's vehement abruptness is in like manner accounted for. He sees in the request at once an attempt to deprive him of the woman he loves and a plot to keep him still in the tutelage of childhood. Of the ingenuity of this theory no one can doubt, nor yet that it may <span class="accented">possibly</span> represent the actual facts. But it is not necessary, nor does it help much to the explanation of the narrative. Bathsheba's intervention may easily be accounted for by <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> her desire to conciliate her son's most formidable rival; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> her feminine interest in a love match; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> her pride, which could not but be flattered, on being assured that her influence with the king was so great.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/2-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1448;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
