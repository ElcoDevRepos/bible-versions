His reign marked a period of political stability and economic prosperity. Omri's acts included the establishment of Samaria as the capital of the Northern Kingdom, which became a central location in Israel's history. His political alliances, such as the marriage of his son Ahab to Jezebel, daughter of the king of Sidon, had lasting religious and cultural impacts, introducing Baal worship into Israel.<p><b>along with his accomplishments</b><br>Omri's accomplishments were notable in terms of military and political achievements. He is credited with expanding Israel's territory and strengthening its defenses. His reign is often seen as a turning point in the history of the Northern Kingdom, setting the stage for the subsequent reign of his son Ahab. Omri's legacy is also recognized in Assyrian records, where Israel is referred to as "the house of Omri," indicating his influence beyond the biblical narrative.<p><b>and the might he exercised</b><br>Omri's might is reflected in his ability to consolidate power and establish a strong central government. His military prowess and strategic alliances helped secure Israel's borders and maintain peace with neighboring nations. This period of might and stability allowed for economic growth and increased trade, contributing to the prosperity of the kingdom.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</b><br>The Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel is a non-extant historical record that chronicled the reigns of the kings of the Northern Kingdom. This reference suggests that Omri's reign was well-documented and significant enough to be included in this official record. The mention of this book highlights the importance of historical documentation in the biblical narrative, even though the actual text is not available today. This phrase also underscores the biblical practice of referring to external sources to validate historical events, a common practice in ancient historiography.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/omri.htm">Omri</a></b><br>A king of Israel who reigned for 12 years.

The verse stresses that God knew every act, highlighted his outward accomplishments and might, and yet judged him chiefly by his spiritual condition. The inspired text gives enough to see that earthly success divorced from obedience brings lasting consequences, while also underscoring the reliability and completeness of Scripture itself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed</span> [Not only in the war with Tibni, but certainly in the subjugation of the Moabites, of which mention is made in the recently discovered <span class="accented">Moabite stone</span>.
