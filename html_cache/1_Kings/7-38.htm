The use of bronze, a durable and valuable metal, signifies the importance and permanence of the temple's function. Bronze was commonly used in ancient Near Eastern cultures for its strength and resistance to corrosion, making it suitable for sacred purposes. The number ten often symbolizes completeness or divine order in biblical numerology, suggesting the thoroughness of the temple's preparation for worship.<p><b>each holding forty baths</b><br>A "bath" is an ancient unit of liquid measurement, roughly equivalent to 5.8 gallons or 22 liters. Therefore, each basin could hold approximately 232 gallons or 880 liters. This substantial capacity indicates the basins' role in ritual purification, a critical aspect of temple worship. The large volume underscores the importance of cleanliness and preparation before approaching God, reflecting the holiness required in worship practices.<p><b>and measuring four cubits across</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement based on the length of the forearm, approximately 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Thus, each basin was about six feet or 1.8 meters in diameter. This size suggests the basins were not only functional but also impressive in appearance, contributing to the temple's grandeur. The dimensions reflect the precision and care in the temple's construction, emphasizing the reverence due to God.<p><b>one basin for each of the ten stands</b><br>The basins were placed on stands, which were likely intricately designed and crafted, as described earlier in the chapter. Each stand having its own basin indicates an organized and systematic approach to temple rituals. This arrangement allowed for multiple priests to perform purification rites simultaneously, facilitating the temple's busy sacrificial system. The stands and basins together highlight the temple's role as a center of worship and community life in Israel, pointing to the order and structure God desires in worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple and its furnishings, including the bronze basins.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram.htm">Hiram</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman from Tyre, who was responsible for creating many of the temple's furnishings, including the bronze basins.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where these basins were placed as part of the temple's furnishings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bronze_basins.htm">Bronze Basins</a></b><br>Large containers used for ceremonial washing, symbolizing purification and readiness to serve God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ten_stands.htm">The Ten Stands</a></b><br>Structures designed to hold the bronze basins, indicating order and purpose in temple worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_purification.htm">Symbolism of Purification</a></b><br>The bronze basins symbolize the need for spiritual cleansing before approaching God.

Ten literal basins were forged from bronze, the same metal used for the altar (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1&#8211;6</a>).

God met practical needs abundantly, mirroring Jesus&#8217; later miracle of transforming water into wine at Cana (<a href="/john/2-6.htm">John 2:6-9</a>), where six stone jars of similar size held &#8220;twenty to thirty gallons each.&#8221; When the Lord provides, He provides generously.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and measuring four cubits across</b><p>A cubit is roughly eighteen inches, so four cubits equals about six feet in diameter.

Precise measurements also reflect God&#8217;s orderliness (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>) and anticipate the meticulous descriptions of the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-15.htm">Revelation 21:15-17</a>).
