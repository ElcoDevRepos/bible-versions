These pillars were not only structural but also symbolic, representing strength and stability. The use of capitals in ancient architecture often signified the crowning glory of a structure, and in the context of the temple, they symbolized the divine presence and majesty of God.<p><b>just above the rounded projection</b><br>The rounded projection likely refers to a bulging or swelling part of the pillar, which was a common feature in ancient Near Eastern architecture.

It also served a practical purpose, providing a base for the decorative elements above.<p><b>next to the network</b><br>The network, or latticework, was an intricate design that adorned the pillars.

The number two hundred signifies completeness and abundance, emphasizing the lavishness of God's provision.<p><b>in rows encircling each capital</b><br>The arrangement of the pomegranates in rows encircling the capitals suggests order and symmetry, reflecting the divine order and harmony that the temple was meant to embody. This design choice also highlights the importance of beauty and precision in worship, as the temple was a place where God's presence dwelled among His people.<p><b>each capital</b><br>The repetition of the design on each capital underscores the uniformity and balance in the temple's construction.
