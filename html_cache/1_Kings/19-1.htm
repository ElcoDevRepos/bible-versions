This phrase highlights the communication between Ahab and Jezebel, indicating a partnership in their rule, though Jezebel often takes the lead in spiritual and political matters. Elijah's actions, particularly the contest on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18), were a direct challenge to the worship of Baal, which Jezebel fervently supported. This sets the stage for Jezebel's reaction, as she is known for her ruthless defense of Baal worship, as seen in her previous actions against the prophets of the Lord (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>).<p><b>and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword</b><br>This refers to Elijah's execution of the prophets of Baal after God demonstrated His power on Mount Carmel. The prophets of Baal, numbering 450, were defeated in a dramatic display of God's supremacy over the false god Baal. This act was not just a physical victory but a spiritual one, symbolizing the triumph of the true God over idolatry. The use of the sword signifies judgment and is reminiscent of the divine justice often executed in the Old Testament. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and falsehood, as He is the fulfillment of the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). Elijah's actions can be seen as a type of Christ's cleansing of the temple (<a href="/john/2-15.htm">John 2:15</a>), where He also confronts false worship and corruption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his weak leadership and for being heavily influenced by his wife, Jezebel.

(See 21:7.) Ahab, as before, remains passive; he has no courage, perhaps no wish, to attack Elijah, before whom he had quailed; but he cares not, or dares not, to restrain Jezebel. She disdains to strike secretly and without warning: in fact, her message seems intended to give the opportunity for a flight, which might degrade Elijah in the eyes of the people. We note that the prophet (see <a href="/1_kings/18-46.htm" title="And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.">1Kings 18:46</a>) had not ventured to enter Jezreel till he should know how his deadly foe would receive the news of the great day at Carmel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and all which he had slain</span>.
