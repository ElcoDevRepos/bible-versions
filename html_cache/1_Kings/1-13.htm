King David, nearing the end of his life, is the central authority in Israel. The urgency reflects the political tension and the need to address the succession issue promptly. The phrase also highlights the role of Nathan the prophet, who is orchestrating this intervention to ensure God's will is fulfilled regarding Solomon's kingship.<p><b>&#8216;My lord the king, did you not swear to your maidservant</b><br>This phrase underscores the personal relationship and trust between King David and Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. The use of "maidservant" reflects humility and respect. The oath mentioned is significant, as oaths were binding and sacred in ancient Israelite culture, often invoking God's name as a witness. This appeal to David's promise is a strategic move to remind him of his commitment.<p><b>&#8220;Surely your son Solomon will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne&#8221;?</b><br>This statement is a direct reference to the divine promise and David's intention for Solomon to succeed him. Solomon's future reign is not just a political decision but is seen as part of God's plan, as indicated in <a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>, where God promises David that Solomon will build the temple. The throne symbolizes legitimate authority and continuity of David's dynasty, which is central to the Davidic Covenant.<p><b>Why then has Adonijah become king?&#8217;</b><br>This question highlights the conflict and the challenge to the rightful succession. Adonijah, another son of David, has declared himself king without David's approval, reflecting the political intrigue and ambition within the royal family. This situation parallels Absalom's earlier rebellion (2 Samuel 15), showing recurring themes of familial strife and the struggle for power. The question serves to alert David to the immediate threat to Solomon's promised kingship and to prompt him to take decisive action.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The aging and ailing king of Israel, who had promised that Solomon would succeed him as king.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The mother of Solomon, who approaches David to remind him of his promise regarding Solomon's succession.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, whom David had promised would be the next king.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>Another son of David, who attempts to usurp the throne without David's consent.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where these events unfold.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_keeping_promises.htm">The Importance of Keeping Promises</a></b><br>David's promise to Bathsheba about Solomon's succession highlights the importance of integrity and faithfulness in our commitments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_leadership.htm">God's Sovereignty in Leadership</a></b><br>Despite Adonijah's attempt to seize power, God's plan for Solomon to reign is ultimately fulfilled, reminding us of God's control over leadership and authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_advocacy.htm">The Role of Advocacy</a></b><br>Bathsheba's approach to David demonstrates the importance of advocating for truth and justice, especially when promises are at stake.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>The unfolding of events shows that God's timing is perfect, and we must trust Him even when circumstances seem uncertain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_ambition.htm">The Consequences of Ambition</a></b><br>Adonijah's ambition leads to conflict and strife, serving as a warning against self-serving pursuits that go against God's will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_1_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 1:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_1_13_God_s_role_in_leadership_change.htm">How does 1 Kings 1:13 demonstrate God's sovereignty in leadership transitions?

Delay would have let Adonijah&#8217;s coup solidify (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5&#8211;7</a>). Scripture often links prompt obedience with protection of God-given promises&#8212;Abraham &#8220;rose early&#8221; after God spoke (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>), and Esther risked everything &#8220;at once&#8221; before the Persian king (<a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; Urgency underscores faith that God is already at work (<a href="/hebrews/3-15.htm">Hebrews 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The appeal is made to the rightful, anointed king (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>), recognizing the order God established (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and say</b><p>Nathan adds, &#8220;and say,&#8221; highlighting the power of carefully chosen words.

Like Nathan&#8217;s own confrontation of David in <a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1</a>, clear words can correct a dangerous course without dishonoring authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;My lord the king, did you not swear to your maidservant,</b><p>Bathsheba is instructed to remind David of his oath: &#8220;Did you not swear to your maidservant&#8230;?&#8221; God&#8217;s people treat vows as sacred (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>). David had promised Bathsheba that Solomon would succeed him (<a href="/1_kings/1-17.htm">1 Kings 1:17</a>; cf. <a href="/1_kings/1-30.htm">1 Kings 1:30</a>). Calling that promise to mind invites the king to keep his word&#8212;a theme repeated when Jonathan held David to his covenant (<a href="/1_samuel/20-17.htm">1 Samuel 20:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Surely your son Solomon will reign after me,</b><p>The quoted assurance, &#8220;Surely your son Solomon will reign after me,&#8221; ties David&#8217;s personal oath to God&#8217;s revealed plan. Earlier, the Lord declared that Solomon was the chosen heir (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9&#8211;10</a>; 28:6&#8211;7). This section reminds us that divine choice, not political maneuvering, determines leadership (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-1.htm">Proverbs 16:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he will sit on my throne</b><p>David&#8217;s throne was more than furniture; it symbolized the covenant line leading to the Messiah (<a href="/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29, 36</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a>). By affirming that Solomon &#8220;will sit on my throne,&#8221; Bathsheba highlights the continuity God promised (<a href="/1_kings/2-12.htm">1 Kings 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>). Faithfulness to that promise keeps the messianic hope alive for future generations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why then has Adonijah become king?&#8217;</b><p>The final question exposes the crisis: &#8220;Why then has Adonijah become king?&#8221; Adonijah&#8217;s self-exaltation (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>) mirrors earlier rebellions&#8212;Korah challenging Moses (<a href="/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a>) and Absalom stealing hearts in Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a>). <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;2</a> describes nations raging against the Lord&#8217;s anointed; the same spirit fuels Adonijah&#8217;s grab for power.

Bathsheba&#8217;s respectful yet pointed reminder of David&#8217;s oath combines urgency, truthful speech, and reliance on divine promise. The verse emphasizes three timeless truths: vows must be honored, rightful authority is established by God, and rebellion cannot overturn His plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Didst not thou . . . swear.</span>--Of this oath we have no mention elsewhere.
