Sackcloth, typically made from coarse goat's hair, was uncomfortable and symbolized self-affliction. The ropes around their heads could signify submission or a plea for mercy, indicating they were at the mercy of the king. This act of humility was a common practice in the ancient world when seeking clemency from a superior, reflecting a recognition of one's lowly status and the authority of the one approached.<p><b>they went to the king of Israel</b><br>The king of Israel at this time was Ahab, who reigned from approximately 874 to 853 BC. Ahab was known for his complex character, often depicted as a king who wavered between following God and succumbing to idolatry, largely influenced by his wife Jezebel. The political landscape was tumultuous, with Israel often in conflict with neighboring kingdoms like Aram (Syria). This visit to Ahab highlights the desperation of Ben-hadad's servants, seeking peace after a series of military defeats.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Your servant Ben-hadad says, &#8216;Please spare my life.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Ben-hadad, the king of Aram, had previously been a formidable enemy of Israel, leading campaigns against them. His plea for life indicates a significant shift in power dynamics, as he acknowledges his defeat and subjugation to Ahab. The term "your servant" is a formal expression of submission, recognizing Ahab's authority over him. This request for mercy is a pivotal moment, reflecting the ancient practice of kings granting clemency to defeated foes, which could lead to political alliances or vassalage.<p><b>And the king answered, &#8220;Is he still alive? He is my brother.&#8221;</b><br>Ahab's response is surprising, given the enmity between Israel and Aram. By referring to Ben-hadad as "my brother," Ahab uses a term that implies equality and potential alliance, rather than enmity. This could reflect a political strategy, as forming alliances with former enemies was a common practice to ensure peace and stability. Ahab's willingness to spare Ben-hadad's life may also indicate a desire to strengthen his own position by securing a powerful ally. This decision, however, would later be criticized by the prophet, as it went against God's command to completely defeat Israel's enemies, highlighting Ahab's tendency to prioritize political expediency over divine instruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) who had previously attacked Israel but was now seeking mercy from the king of Israel after being defeated.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel</a></b><br>Ahab, the king of Israel, who is approached by Ben-hadad's servants seeking mercy for their king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sackcloth_and_ropes.htm">Sackcloth and Ropes</a></b><br>Symbols of humility and submission, indicating Ben-hadad's desperate plea for mercy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram (Syria)</a></b><br>The nation that Ben-hadad ruled, which was in conflict with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants_of_ben-hadad.htm">The Servants of Ben-hadad</a></b><br>Messengers sent to plead for Ben-hadad's life, demonstrating the king's submission and request for peace.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_seeking_mercy.htm">Humility in Seeking Mercy</a></b><br>The act of wearing sackcloth and ropes symbolizes humility and repentance.

The phrase confesses a reversal: the aggressor now submits.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Please spare my life.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; A plain plea for mercy, admitting God-given defeat (cf. <a href="/joshua/9-24.htm">Joshua 9:24-25</a>, Gibeonites seeking life).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows that God welcomes humility, even from pagans (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-12.htm">2 Chronicles 33:12-13</a>), though it never excuses earlier sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the king answered, &#8220;Is he still alive?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Ahab&#8217;s surprised question highlights how decisively God won the battle; he assumed Ben-hadad was already dead (<a href="/1_kings/20-30.htm">1 Kings 20:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Instead of first asking what God desires (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-12.htm">Deuteronomy 20:12-13</a>), Ahab&#8217;s attention pivots to political opportunity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;He is my brother.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Ahab elevates a defeated enemy to peer status, ignoring God&#8217;s prior instruction through the prophet to devote Ben-hadad to destruction (<a href="/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35-42</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast Saul&#8217;s disobedient mercy toward Agag in <a href="/1_samuel/15-9.htm">1 Samuel 15:9</a>; both acts of misplaced compassion provoke divine displeasure.<p>&#8226; The statement exposes Ahab&#8217;s heart: political alliances trump allegiance to God (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>, friendship with the world).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/20-32.htm">1 Kings 20:32</a> captures the dramatic moment when Aram&#8217;s envoys appear in full humiliation&#8212;sackcloth and ropes&#8212;seeking mercy from Israel&#8217;s king. Their posture rightly acknowledges God&#8217;s judgment and Israel&#8217;s victory. Yet Ahab, instead of asking what God requires, rashly calls Ben-hadad &#8220;my brother,&#8221; granting him life and treaty privileges. The verse warns against confusing worldly diplomacy with faithful obedience: humility before God is commendable, but leaders must also carry out the LORD&#8217;s explicit commands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live.</span> [Compare with this abject petition for life the arrogant insolence of vers. 6, 10.
