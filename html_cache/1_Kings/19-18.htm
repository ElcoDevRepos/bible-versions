The number "seven thousand" symbolizes completeness and perfection, indicating a significant group that remains loyal to God. This remnant concept is crucial throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4-5</a>, where Paul references this passage to illustrate that God always preserves a faithful group. The context here is Elijah's despair after his confrontation with the prophets of Baal, where he feels isolated in his faithfulness. God's assurance to Elijah serves as a reminder that His plans are not thwarted by human unfaithfulness.<p><b>all whose knees have not bowed to Baal</b><br>Baal worship was prevalent in Israel during the reign of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel, who actively promoted it. Bowing the knee is a sign of worship and submission, and this phrase indicates those who have not succumbed to idolatry. Baal was a Canaanite deity associated with fertility and storms, and his worship often involved immoral practices. The faithful remnant's refusal to bow signifies their steadfastness in upholding the worship of Yahweh alone, aligning with the first commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>. This resistance to idolatry is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing the call to exclusive devotion to God.<p><b>and whose mouths have not kissed him.</b><br>Kissing was a common act of homage and reverence in ancient Near Eastern cultures, often used in idol worship. This phrase underscores the complete rejection of Baal worship by the faithful remnant, not only in action (bowing) but also in word and expression (kissing). The act of kissing an idol is mentioned in <a href="/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>, illustrating the depth of Israel's idolatry. By highlighting those who have not kissed Baal, the text emphasizes the purity and integrity of the remnant's worship. This imagery also foreshadows the New Testament call to worship God in spirit and truth, as seen in <a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>, where true worship is defined by sincerity and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who is central to this chapter.
