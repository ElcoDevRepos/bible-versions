The harshness of his response is indicative of a lack of wisdom and understanding, contrasting sharply with the reign of his father, Solomon, who was known for his wisdom. This moment is pivotal as it leads to the division of the united kingdom of Israel into two separate entities: the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. The harshness can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Solomon that the kingdom would be torn from his lineage due to his disobedience (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>). This event also highlights the importance of wise and compassionate leadership, a theme that is echoed throughout the Bible, particularly in the teachings of Jesus Christ, who exemplified servant leadership (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>).<p><b>He rejected the advice of the elders.</b><br>Rehoboam's rejection of the elders' advice signifies a critical error in judgment. The elders, who had served under Solomon, likely offered counsel based on experience and a desire for the stability of the kingdom. Their advice was to serve the people and speak kindly to them, which would have likely resulted in loyalty and unity (<a href="/1_kings/12-7.htm">1 Kings 12:7</a>). By rejecting this counsel, Rehoboam not only ignored the wisdom of those who had successfully governed before him but also set the stage for rebellion and division. This decision underscores the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>, which states, "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed." The rejection of wise counsel is a recurring theme in Scripture, often leading to downfall and disaster, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures who failed to heed godly advice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Israel at this time.

The king&#8217;s mouth exposes pride and insecurity rather than servant leadership (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42&#8211;45</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast: &#8220;A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>). Rehoboam chooses the very approach Scripture warns against.<p>&#8226; The result fulfills Samuel&#8217;s earlier prophecy about a king who would take and oppress (<a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11&#8211;18</a>). Harshness signals a break with his father&#8217;s initial humility (<a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Leaders today can note that harshness erodes trust, while &#8220;the wise in heart are called discerning, and gracious speech promotes instruction&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-21.htm">Proverbs 16:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He rejected the advice of the elders</b><p>&#8226; The elders had served Solomon and understood the pulse of the nation (<a href="/1_kings/12-6.htm">1 Kings 12:6&#8211;7</a>). Their counsel: &#8220;If you will be a servant to these people... they will be your servants forever.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Rehoboam prefers the flattery of younger companions (<a href="/1_kings/12-8.htm">1 Kings 12:8&#8211;11</a>), mirroring <a href="/proverbs/18-2.htm">Proverbs 18:2</a>&#8212;&#8220;A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in airing his opinions.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Ignoring godly counsel carries consequences. &#8220;Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>). Rehoboam&#8217;s kingdom literally fractures in the next verses.<p>&#8226; The pattern repeats throughout Scripture: Saul ignores Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24&#8211;26</a>); Amaziah spurns the prophet (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-15.htm">2 Chronicles 25:15&#8211;16</a>). Rejecting seasoned, God-honoring advice invites judgment.<p>&#8226; The elders&#8217; advice aligned with covenant principles of justice and mercy (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). Refusal to hear them shows a deeper rejection of the Lord, who lifts the humble and opposes the proud (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/12-13.htm">1 Kings 12:13</a> captures a turning point. Harsh speech and the dismissal of wise counsel unmask a leader&#8217;s heart distant from God. Rehoboam&#8217;s single decision splits a nation, demonstrating the timeless truth that words matter and advice matters. God calls His people&#8212;and especially His leaders&#8212;to gentle, servant-hearted responses and to ears open to seasoned, godly wisdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king answered the people</span> [the omission of Jeroboam's name, though perhaps it cannot he pressed in argument, is noticeable] <span class="cmt_word">roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/12-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1435;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
