Ahab's reign is marked by idolatry and conflict, particularly with the prophet Elijah. His response here is part of a larger narrative involving a confrontation with Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram. Ahab's character is often seen as weak and compromising, especially in spiritual matters, which is evident in his interactions with foreign powers and his marriage to Jezebel, a Phoenician princess who promoted Baal worship in Israel.<p><b>&#8220;Just as you say, my lord the king:</b><br>Ahab's use of "my lord the king" indicates a position of submission and acknowledgment of Ben-Hadad's authority. This reflects the political reality of the time, where smaller kingdoms like Israel often had to navigate relationships with more powerful neighbors. The phrase suggests a lack of resistance and a willingness to comply with demands, which can be seen as a failure to trust in the Lord's protection and provision. This attitude contrasts with the biblical ideal of kingship, where the king should lead the nation in faithfulness to God.<p><b>I am yours,</b><br>This declaration of submission highlights Ahab's willingness to place himself under the authority of a foreign king. In the broader biblical narrative, Israel's kings were expected to lead the nation in covenant faithfulness to God, not to submit to pagan rulers. This phrase can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual compromise, where allegiance to God is replaced by allegiance to worldly powers. It serves as a cautionary example of the dangers of forsaking divine authority for human alliances.<p><b>along with all that I have.&#8221;</b><br>Ahab's statement extends his submission to include all his possessions, indicating a total surrender. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of vassal treaties, where a lesser king would pledge loyalty and tribute to a superior king. Biblically, this can be contrasted with the call for Israel to be a distinct and holy nation, set apart for God's purposes. Theologically, it underscores the theme of misplaced trust and the consequences of relying on human strength rather than divine support. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual downfall of Ahab's dynasty, as his compromises lead to judgment and destruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-Hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) who besieged Samaria and demanded tribute from Ahab, the king of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his weak leadership and idolatry, who submitted to Ben-Hadad's demands.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital city of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, under siege by Ben-Hadad's forces.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram (Syria)</a></b><br>A neighboring kingdom to Israel, often in conflict with Israel during this period.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/siege_of_samaria.htm">Siege of Samaria</a></b><br>The event where Ben-Hadad surrounded Samaria, leading to Ahab's submission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/submission_to_authority.htm">Submission to Authority</a></b><br>Ahab's response to Ben-Hadad's demands shows a lack of discernment in submission.

It serves as a sobering reminder that kings&#8212;and all believers&#8212;must anchor identity, allegiance, and resources in the LORD alone, resisting the temptation to appease worldly powers at the cost of faithful obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.</span> [Much has been written about Ahab's pusillanimous acquiescence in these disgraceful terms, etc. But it is not absolutely clear that he ever meant to surrender either wives or children to the invader. All that is certain is that he judged it wise, in the presence of the enormous force arrayed against him, to make every possible concession, to adopt the most subservient tone, and to cringe at the feet of Ben-hadad. But all the time he may have hoped that his soft answer would turn away wrath. It is very far from certain that had Ben-hadad sent to demand the wives and children which Ahab here seems willing to yield to him they would have been sent. When Ben-hadad threatens (ver. 6) a measure which involved much less indignity than the surrender of the entire seraglio to his lusts, Ahab stands at bay. Allowance must be made for the exaggerations of Eastern courtesy. The writer was entertained in 1861 by Jacob esh Shellabi, then sheykh of the Samaritans, who repeatedly used words very similar to these. "This house is yours," he would say; never meaning, however, that he should be taken at his word.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/20-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
