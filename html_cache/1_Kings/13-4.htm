Bethel, meaning "House of God," was a significant religious site, but Jeroboam established it as a center for idol worship, setting up golden calves to prevent his people from going to Jerusalem. This act was a direct violation of God's commandments and a political move to consolidate his power. The altar in Bethel symbolizes the corruption and apostasy of Israel under Jeroboam's rule.<p><b>heard the word that the man of God had cried out against it</b><br>The "man of God" is a prophet sent by the Lord to deliver a message of judgment against the altar. This prophetic act demonstrates God's disapproval of Jeroboam's idolatry. Prophets often served as God's mouthpieces, calling leaders and people back to covenant faithfulness. The word cried out was a direct challenge to Jeroboam's authority and religious practices, emphasizing the seriousness of his sin.<p><b>he stretched out his hand and said, &#8220;Seize him!&#8221;</b><br>Jeroboam's reaction reveals his hostility towards God's message and messenger. Stretching out his hand is a gesture of authority and command, intending to silence the prophet and suppress the divine message. This reflects a common biblical theme where leaders resist God's word, similar to Pharaoh's hardened heart in Exodus. Jeroboam's command to "seize him" shows his intent to maintain control and eliminate opposition.<p><b>But the hand he stretched out toward him withered</b><br>The withering of Jeroboam's hand is an immediate divine judgment, demonstrating God's power and the futility of opposing His will. This miraculous sign serves as a warning to Jeroboam and the people of Israel about the consequences of disobedience. It parallels other biblical instances where God intervenes directly, such as the plagues in Egypt. The withered hand symbolizes the impotence of human authority against divine sovereignty.<p><b>so that he could not pull it back</b><br>Jeroboam's inability to retract his hand signifies his helplessness before God's power. This physical ailment underscores the spiritual paralysis that results from rebellion against God. It serves as a humbling experience for Jeroboam, illustrating that no earthly power can withstand God's judgment. This incident foreshadows the eventual downfall of Jeroboam's dynasty due to persistent idolatry and disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_jeroboam.htm">King Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.
