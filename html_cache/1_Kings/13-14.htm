The man of God had delivered a prophecy against the altar at Bethel, which was a center of idolatrous worship established by King Jeroboam. The old prophet's pursuit suggests a sense of urgency or divine prompting, reflecting the seriousness of the message delivered by the man of God. This pursuit can be seen as a test of the man of God's obedience to God's command not to eat or drink in Bethel or return by the same way he came.<p><b>He found him sitting under an oak tree</b><br>The oak tree is significant in biblical narratives as a place of rest, reflection, or divine encounter. Oaks were often landmarks and places of shade in the ancient Near East. The man of God sitting under the oak tree may symbolize a moment of vulnerability or contemplation after his prophetic mission. This setting also foreshadows the impending test of his obedience to God's instructions, as he is found in a state of rest rather than continuing his journey.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;Are you the man of God who came from Judah?&#8221;</b><br>The question posed by the old prophet confirms the identity of the man of God and acknowledges his origin from Judah. This highlights the distinction between the northern kingdom of Israel, where Bethel is located, and the southern kingdom of Judah. The man of God's journey from Judah to Bethel underscores the division between the two kingdoms and the significance of his mission to confront the idolatry in Israel. The inquiry also sets the stage for the deception that follows, as the old prophet seeks to engage the man of God in conversation.<p><b>&#8220;I am,&#8221; he replied.</b><br>The man of God's response is straightforward and affirms his identity. This acknowledgment is crucial as it establishes his authority and the authenticity of his prophetic message. However, his willingness to engage with the old prophet, despite God's clear instructions, foreshadows his eventual disobedience. This moment serves as a reminder of the importance of steadfastness in following God's commands, even when faced with seemingly benign interactions. The man of God's reply also reflects the theme of identity and mission, central to the narrative of prophets in the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>A prophet from Judah sent by God to deliver a message against the altar at Bethel.

Compare Saul&#8217;s misguided zeal in <a href="/1_samuel/13-11.htm">1 Samuel 13:11&#8211;12</a> and Paul&#8217;s testimony in <a href="/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13&#8211;14</a>.<p>- Scripture repeatedly warns that the enemy often hunts God&#8217;s servants (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>).

Every delay risked compromise, as Lot learned when he lingered in <a href="/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15&#8211;16</a>.<p>- Oaks mark important covenant moments in Scripture (<a href="/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-26.htm">Joshua 24:26</a>), yet here the setting underscores hesitation rather than covenant faithfulness.

Together they highlight the peril of lingering where God has not called us to linger, the subtlety of deception that mimics respect, and the necessity of unwavering adherence to the Lord&#8217;s explicit commands.

This expression is an evident mark of the antiquity of the document from which the history is taken. It has been suggested that the narrative implies a needless loitering of the prophet of Judah on the way. Taken by itself, it would not necessarily convey this; but in relation to the temper indicated in the whole story, the thing may be not improbable. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the</span> oak; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the well-known oak. Possibly there was but one, or one of great size, in the neighbourhood - such trees are comparatively rare in Palestine. Possibly also this tree became well known from these events. It is singular that in another place (<a href="/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>) we read of "the oak" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) of Bethel, whilst in <a href="/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a> we read of the "palm tree" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) of Deborah, between Ramah and <span class="accented">Bethel</span>." And it is not at all improbable, seeing that in <a href="/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a> we read of the terebinth (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) of <span class="accented">Tabor -</span> in the A.V. rendered "<span class="accented">plain</span> of Tabor" - which Ewald ("Hist.

The word here used, it is true, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (which is generally supposed to indicate the terebinth, but is also "used of any large tree" (Gesenius), and which, therefore, may be used of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> of Bethel.
