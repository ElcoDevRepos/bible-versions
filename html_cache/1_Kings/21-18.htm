Ahab, as king of Israel, represents the northern kingdom during a time of significant apostasy and idolatry. His reign is marked by his marriage to Jezebel and the introduction of Baal worship, which led Israel further away from the worship of Yahweh. Elijah's role as a prophet is to confront and call out the sin of the king, highlighting the prophetic tradition of holding leaders accountable to God's covenant.<p><b>who is in Samaria</b><br>Samaria is the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, established by King Omri, Ahab's father. It serves as the political and religious center of the kingdom. The mention of Samaria underscores the centralization of power and the influence of Ahab's rule. Archaeological findings in Samaria reveal a city with significant fortifications and structures, indicating its importance and wealth during Ahab's reign.<p><b>See, he is in the vineyard of Naboth</b><br>The vineyard of Naboth is located in Jezreel, a city with strategic and fertile land. Naboth's refusal to sell his ancestral inheritance to Ahab is rooted in the Mosaic Law, which prohibited the permanent sale of family land (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>). This incident highlights the tension between royal authority and the rights of individuals under God's law. Ahab's desire for the vineyard and subsequent actions reveal his disregard for divine commandments and justice.<p><b>where he has gone to take possession of it</b><br>Ahab's attempt to take possession of Naboth's vineyard follows the unjust execution of Naboth, orchestrated by Jezebel. This act of injustice is a direct violation of the commandments against coveting and bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16-17</a>). The narrative foreshadows the divine judgment that will come upon Ahab and his house, as prophesied by Elijah. This event also serves as a type of Christ, where the innocent suffer at the hands of corrupt authority, pointing to Jesus' own unjust trial and crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wickedness and idolatry, particularly influenced by his wife Jezebel.

Just as He told Elijah earlier, &#8220;Get up and go to Zarephath&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9</a>), and later told Jonah, &#8220;Get up! Go to Nineveh&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/1-2.htm">Jonah 1:2</a>), God often propels His servants from contemplation to action.<p>&#8226; Obedience begins with rising&#8212;leaving comfort or discouragement behind (cf. <a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4-8</a>). When God speaks, remaining seated is not an option.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and go down</b><p>&#8226; Elijah is to descend from wherever he is&#8212;probably in the hill country&#8212;to confront sin in the lowland of Jezreel. Similar wording appears when the angel told Elijah, &#8220;Go down with him&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/1-15.htm">2 Kings 1:15</a>), underscoring purposeful movement toward a divine appointment.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Going down&#8221; pictures humility and submission to God&#8217;s assignment, the same posture required of any servant heading into spiritual conflict (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to meet Ahab king of Israel</b><p>&#8226; God pinpoints the target: Ahab, whose record of idolatry and injustice is detailed in <a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30-33</a>. This is not a casual chat; it mirrors Nathan&#8217;s confrontation of David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1</a>), showing that even kings answer to the Lord.<p>&#8226; Earlier, Ahab labeled Elijah the &#8220;troubler of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/18-17.htm">1 Kings 18:17</a>). Now God sends the prophet again, proving that repeated warnings testify to the Lord&#8217;s patience before judgment (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who is in Samaria</b><p>&#8226; Although Ahab&#8217;s throne is in Samaria (<a href="/1_kings/20-43.htm">1 Kings 20:43</a>), he is no longer confined to his palace. His reach&#8212;both political and moral&#8212;extends throughout the land.<p>&#8226; The mention of Samaria reminds readers of the covenantal center that Ahab has corrupted with Baal worship (<a href="/1_kings/16-32.htm">1 Kings 16:32</a>), highlighting how national sin begins at the top.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>See, he is in the vineyard of Naboth</b><p>&#8226; God pinpoints Ahab&#8217;s exact location, revealing divine omniscience: &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are everywhere&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Naboth&#8217;s vineyard, introduced in <a href="/1_kings/21-1.htm">1 Kings 21:1-3</a>, was the site of false accusation and murder (vv. 8-14). By naming it, God emphasizes that He remembers every injustice (cf. <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s march to that very plot of land previews future reckoning at the scene of the crime (<a href="/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where he has gone to take possession of it</b><p>&#8226; Ahab is literally caught in the act of covetous appropriation.
