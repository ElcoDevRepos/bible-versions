This division was a direct consequence of Solomon's idolatry and the subsequent judgment pronounced by the prophet Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-39</a>). The ongoing war between these two kings highlights the fulfillment of God's word and the political instability that followed the split. The enmity between the two kingdoms is a recurring theme in the historical books of the Old Testament, illustrating the consequences of disobedience to God's covenant.<p><b>throughout their days.</b><br>The phrase "throughout their days" indicates that the conflict was not a temporary skirmish but a prolonged state of hostility that lasted for the entire reigns of both kings. This ongoing warfare prevented any possibility of reunification and further entrenched the division between the northern and southern kingdoms. The continuous conflict also reflects the broader theme of human failure and the need for a righteous king, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who brings peace and unity. The enduring strife between Rehoboam and Jeroboam serves as a backdrop for understanding the later prophetic calls for repentance and the hope for a future restoration under a new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah.
