The earthquake and fire are reminiscent of God's previous manifestations, such as at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>) and in the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>). However, in this instance, the text emphasizes that the LORD was not in these powerful displays. This suggests a shift from the expectation of God's presence in grandiose phenomena to a more intimate and personal revelation. The absence of God in the fire contrasts with earlier biblical events, highlighting that God's presence is not confined to traditional or expected forms. This can be seen as a reminder that God chooses diverse ways to communicate with His people, often beyond human expectations.<p><b>And after the fire came a still, small voice.</b><br>The "still, small voice" represents a gentle whisper, a stark contrast to the preceding powerful events. This phrase underscores the idea that God's communication is not always through dramatic or overwhelming means but can be subtle and quiet. This moment is pivotal for Elijah, who is in a state of fear and despair, fleeing from Jezebel's threats. The gentle whisper signifies God's personal and comforting presence, offering guidance and reassurance. This mode of divine communication is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>, which encourages believers to "be still, and know that I am God." The still, small voice can be seen as a type of Christ, who often spoke in parables and gentle teachings, emphasizing humility and peace. This passage invites believers to seek God's presence in the quiet moments of life, encouraging a personal and introspective relationship with the divine.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who is central to this passage.

Very similar expression <a href="/job/4-16.htm">Job 4:16</a>. What was the object and meaning of this succession of signs? First, let us remember that Elijah was the prophet of deeds. He taught his contemporaries not by word but by act. He is here taught in turn by signs. There passes before him in the mountain hollow, in the black and dark night, a procession of natural terrors-of storm, and earthquake, and fire. But none of these things move him; none speak to his soul and tell of a present God. It is the hushed voice, the awful stillness, overpowers and enchains him. He is to learn hence, first, that the Lord is a God "merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth" (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>); and secondly, that as it has been with himself, so it will be with others; the name of the Lord will be proclaimed in a voice of gentle silence (<span class="accented">ib</span>.<span class="accented">, ver</span>. 5). The weapons of His warfare, the instruments of religious progress, must be spiritual, not carnal. Not in fire and sword and slaughter, but by a secret voice speaking to the conscience, will God regain His sway over the hearts of Israel. (See Homiletics.) The striking similarity between this theophany and that which Moses saw in the same place, or at no great distance from it, must not be overlooked, for this constitutes another link between law giver and law restorer. The proclamation of <a href="/exodus/34-3.htm">Exodus 34:3, 7</a> is the best exponent of the parable of vers. 11, 12. To each was the vision of God granted after a faithful witness against idolatry, and after a slaughter of idolaters; each was in a clift of the rock; in either case the Lord <span class="accented">passed by</span>; the one was taught by words, the other rather by signs, but the message in each case was the same - that judgment is God's strange work, but that He will by no means clear the guilty (cf. ver. 17).] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/19-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
