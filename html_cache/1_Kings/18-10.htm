In ancient Israel, oaths were often made in the name of God to affirm truthfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>). The use of "the LORD your God" indicates a recognition of the God of Israel, even by those outside the covenant community, showing the widespread acknowledgment of His power and authority. This phrase also underscores the living nature of God, contrasting with the lifeless idols worshiped by surrounding nations (<a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>).<p><b>there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent someone to search for you</b><br>This highlights the extensive efforts made by King Ahab to find Elijah, demonstrating the prophet's significance and the threat he posed to Ahab's rule. Elijah's role as a prophet was pivotal during a time of rampant idolatry in Israel, particularly the worship of Baal. The search across nations and kingdoms indicates the geopolitical landscape of the time, where Israel interacted with various neighboring entities. This also reflects the desperation of Ahab, as Elijah had declared a drought (<a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>), which was a direct challenge to Baal, the Canaanite storm god.<p><b>When they said, &#8216;He is not here,&#8217;</b><br>This phrase suggests the thoroughness of the search and the frustration of Ahab's efforts. Elijah's ability to remain hidden can be seen as divine protection, similar to how God protected other prophets and leaders, such as Moses (<a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>). It also emphasizes the futility of human efforts against God's plans, as Elijah was under divine commission.<p><b>he made that kingdom or nation swear that they had not found you</b><br>This indicates the seriousness with which Ahab pursued Elijah, compelling other nations to take oaths. Such oaths were binding and carried significant weight in ancient Near Eastern culture. The act of making other nations swear suggests Ahab's authority and the political alliances or pressures he could exert. It also reflects the fear and respect Elijah commanded, as even foreign rulers were involved in the search. This scenario foreshadows the ultimate triumph of God's purposes, as seen in the eventual confrontation on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-20.htm">1 Kings 18:20-40</a>), where Elijah demonstrates the power of the true God over Baal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was in hiding due to the persecution of prophets by King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/obadiah.htm">Obadiah</a></b><br>A devout believer in the LORD who served as the palace administrator under King Ahab.

Obadiah&#8217;s oath affirms that the LORD is living and truthful; the king&#8217;s exhaustive quest proves powerless against God&#8217;s hiddenness; every unproductive report testifies to divine oversight; and compulsory oaths from other nations only magnify how utterly unable man is to thwart God&#8217;s purpose.
