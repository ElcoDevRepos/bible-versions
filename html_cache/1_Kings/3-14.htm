Walking in God's ways implies living a life in accordance with His will and guidance. Biblically, "walking" often symbolizes one's conduct or lifestyle (<a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). It suggests a continuous, active relationship with God, requiring obedience and faithfulness.<p><b>and keep My statutes and commandments,</b><br>The statutes and commandments refer to the laws given by God, primarily through Moses, which are found in the Torah. These laws were central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-3</a>). Keeping them was a sign of loyalty and devotion to God. This requirement underscores the importance of adherence to divine law as a measure of faithfulness.<p><b>just as your father David did,</b><br>David is presented as a model of faithfulness, despite his moral failings. His heart was devoted to God, and he sought forgiveness and restoration when he sinned (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>). This reference to David highlights the importance of a repentant heart and a sincere commitment to God. It also establishes a dynastic continuity, linking Solomon's reign to the promises made to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>I will prolong your days.&#8221;</b><br>The promise of prolonged life is a common biblical blessing associated with obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3.htm">Proverbs 3:1-2</a>). In the context of Solomon, it implies not only a long life but also a prosperous and stable reign. This promise is conditional, reflecting the broader biblical theme that blessings are often contingent upon faithfulness to God's covenant. Solomon's eventual failure to fully adhere to God's commands (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-13</a>) serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the newly anointed king of Israel.

For though Solomon's age at the time of death is not given, yet, as his reign is given as lasting forty years, it could hardly have exceeded sixty. (Josephus, indeed, with his usual tendency to amplification, extends the reign to eighty years, and makes Solomon die in extreme old age.) The rest received an extraordinary fulfilment. The greatness of Solomon's kingdom stands out remarkable in its sudden and unique development, the fruit of David's long career of conquest and improvement, destined to wither at once at Solomon's death. Then, for the first and last time, did the monarchy assume something of the character of an empire, unequalled in peaceful prosperity of wealth and power, and in splendour of civilisation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes</span> and my <span class="cmt_word">commandments, as thy father David did walk</span> [ver. 6; 15:4.
