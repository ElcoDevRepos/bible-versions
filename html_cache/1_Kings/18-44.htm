Persistent prayer (seven times) meets a tiny cloud&#8212;the pledge of God&#8217;s abundant answer. Elijah, certain of the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness, urges immediate, practical response. The scene reminds believers that even the smallest evidence of God&#8217;s working warrants bold expectation and obedient preparation, for when He moves, blessings can overtake as swiftly as a storm rolling in from the sea.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand.</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> lit.<span class="accented">, palm</span>, hollow of hand. Cf. <a href="/luke/12-54.htm">Luke 12:54</a>, "When ye see the cloud (Gr. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) arise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is." "Still in autumn the little cloud comes up like a man's hand and swells till huge thunder pillars are piled black and high above the mountains" (Condor). But it is not in Palestine alone that a little cloud on the horizon is frequently the harbinger of rain]. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Go up</span> [see note on ver. 42], <span class="cmt_word">say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">bind</span>]<span class="cmt_word"></span>, <span class="accented">and get thee down</span> [Keil, Stanley, and others assume that Ahab's chariot was waiting at the foot of the mountain. But it is to be noticed that the command to harness the horses precedes that to "go down." The writer <span class="accented">rode</span> down from <span class="accented">El Murahkah</span> to the plain, and it is quite conceivable that the royal chariot may have conveyed Ahab to the plateau of sacrifice and have waited for him there], <span class="cmt_word">that the rain stop thee not,</span> [After heavy rain (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>) the Kishon, which "collects the whole drainage of this large basin" (Conder), the Great Plain, soon becomes an impassable swamp.(<a href="/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a>), "I can tell you from experience that in wet seasons it (the Wady) is extremely muddy, and then the Kishon causes great tribulation to the muleteers. Rarely indeed do they get over it without some of their animals sticking fast in its oozy bottom" (Thomson, L. and B. 2. p. 218).] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/18-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the seventh time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1506;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;i&#183;&#8216;&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
