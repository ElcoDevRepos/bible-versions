Jezebel, the wife of King Ahab, was a Phoenician princess known for her idolatry and manipulation. Her influence over Ahab and Israel is significant, as she often led the king into sin. The act of sending word to Jezebel highlights her control and authority, even over the local leaders. This reflects the political structure of the time, where the queen could wield significant power. The elders and nobles, instead of upholding justice, comply with Jezebel's wicked plan, showing the moral decay and fear of royal retribution prevalent in Israel.<p><b>Naboth has been stoned to death:</b><br>Stoning was a common method of execution in ancient Israel, prescribed in the Law of Moses for certain offenses (<a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/17-5.htm">Deuteronomy 17:5</a>). However, Naboth's stoning was a result of false accusations and a miscarriage of justice, orchestrated by Jezebel to seize his vineyard for Ahab. This act of injustice is a stark violation of the commandments against bearing false witness and coveting (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16-17</a>). Naboth's death is a type of Christ, as both were innocent and falsely accused, leading to their execution. This event also foreshadows the judgment that would come upon Ahab's house, as prophesied by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>). Naboth's unjust death serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and the perversion of justice when leaders are corrupt.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naboth.htm">Naboth</a></b><br>A righteous Israelite who owned a vineyard in Jezreel.
