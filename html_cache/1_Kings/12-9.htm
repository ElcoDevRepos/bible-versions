This reflects the biblical principle of seeking wisdom from others, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which emphasizes the importance of guidance. However, the outcome of his inquiry highlights the need for discerning whose advice to follow.<p><b>&#8220;What message do you advise</b><br>Rehoboam is inquiring about the response he should give to the Israelites. This moment is pivotal, as it demonstrates the weight of leadership decisions and their potential to impact a nation. The request for advice underscores the importance of wise counsel, a theme prevalent throughout the wisdom literature of the Old Testament.<p><b>that we send back to these people</b><br>The "people" refers to the Israelites who have gathered at Shechem to make Rehoboam king. This setting is significant as Shechem is a historical site of covenant renewal (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1-25</a>), symbolizing the people's desire for a renewed commitment from their leader.<p><b>who have spoken to me, saying,</b><br>The people&#8217;s request is a direct appeal to Rehoboam, indicating their desire for change and relief from the burdens imposed by Solomon. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of the Israelites' frequent appeals to their leaders for justice and mercy.<p><b>&#8216;Lighten the yoke your father put on us&#8217;?&#8221;</b><br>The "yoke" symbolizes the heavy burdens of labor and taxation imposed by Solomon to support his extensive building projects, including the temple and his palace. This request for a lighter yoke echoes the biblical theme of liberation from oppression, reminiscent of the Israelites' deliverance from Egyptian bondage. It also foreshadows the New Testament promise of Jesus, who offers rest and an easy yoke (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>), contrasting the burdens of legalism and human authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Israel at this time.

Rehoboam pauses to ask for advice, but his wording already betrays distance from the people and a preoccupation with political optics. The verse highlights the power of counsel, the danger of detached leadership, and the responsibility to relieve, not increase, burdens.
