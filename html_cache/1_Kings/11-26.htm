The name "Jeroboam" means "the people will contend" or "he increases the people," which foreshadows his future role in leading a rebellion. Nebat, his father, is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, indicating that Jeroboam's rise to prominence was not due to a notable family background but rather his own actions and God's purposes.<p><b>was an Ephraimite from Zeredah</b><br>Being an Ephraimite places Jeroboam within the tribe of Ephraim, one of the most prominent tribes of Israel, often associated with leadership and strength. Ephraim was a son of Joseph, and the tribe held significant influence in the northern kingdom. Zeredah, his hometown, is not well-documented archaeologically, but its mention highlights Jeroboam's roots in the northern part of Israel, which would later become the center of his kingdom.<p><b>whose mother was a widow named Zeruah</b><br>The mention of Jeroboam's mother, Zeruah, as a widow, provides insight into his social status. In ancient Israel, widows were often vulnerable and lacked economic support, suggesting that Jeroboam may have risen from humble beginnings. This detail emphasizes God's ability to raise leaders from unexpected places, a theme seen throughout Scripture.<p><b>Jeroboam was a servant of Solomon</b><br>Jeroboam's role as a servant, or more accurately, an official under Solomon, indicates his initial loyalty and position within the king's administration. This position allowed him to gain insight into the workings of the kingdom and Solomon's policies, which later influenced his actions. His service under Solomon also highlights the irony of his eventual rebellion against the very king he once served.<p><b>but he rebelled against the king</b><br>Jeroboam's rebellion is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, leading to the division of the united monarchy. His revolt was not merely a personal ambition but was prophesied by the prophet Ahijah as a divine judgment against Solomon's idolatry and disobedience (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-39</a>). This rebellion fulfilled God's word and set the stage for the northern kingdom of Israel. Jeroboam's actions also serve as a cautionary tale about the consequences of turning away from God's commandments, as his reign was marked by idolatry and conflict.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam_son_of_nebat.htm">Jeroboam son of Nebat</a></b><br>An Ephraimite who served under King Solomon.

Jeroboam&#8217;s story begins with promise but ends as a cautionary tale: privilege and position, unmoored from obedience, can fracture a nation as surely as they elevate a man.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span>--The life and character of Jeroboam are given in considerable detail in the history; and it is also remarkable that in some of the MSS. of the LXX. we find inserted after <a href="/1_kings/12-24.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They listened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.">1Kings 12:24</a> an independent account of his early history (see Note at the end of the chapter), generally of inferior authority, and having several suspicious features, but perhaps preserving some genuine details. As the great rebel against the House of David, the leader of the revolution which divided Israel and destroyed its greatness, the introducer of the idolatry of the temples of Dan and Bethel, and the corrupter of the worship of Jehovah in deference to an astute worldly policy, he stands out in a vividness of portraiture unapproached, till we come to the history of Ahab at the close of the book.<p><span class= "bld">An Ephrathite of Zereda.</span>--The word "Ephrathite," which mostly means an inhabitant of Ephrata or Bethlehem, is here (as in <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm" title="Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:">1Samuel 1:1</a>) simply another form of the name Ephraimite. Zereda is mostly supposed to be <span class= "ital">Zarthan</span> (see 7:46 and <a href="/2_chronicles/4-17.htm" title="In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.">2Chronicles 4:17</a>), a town of Ephraim in the Jordan valley. The Vatican MS. of the LXX., by a slight change in the Hebrew, reads <span class= "ital">Sarira</span>, which is probably a rendering of <span class= "ital">Zererah</span> or <span class= "ital">Zererath</span> (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm" title="And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, to Tabbath.">Judges 7:22</a>), and, in the additional record noticed above, makes it a strong fortified place in Mount Ephraim.<p><span class= "bld">The son of a widow woman.</span>--This phrase, added to the phrase "Solomon's servant," is evidently designed to mark the utterly dependent condition from which Solomon's favour raised the future rebel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jeroboam</span> [Viewed in the light of their history, the names <span class="accented">Jeroboam</span> and <span class="accented">Rehoboam are</span> both instructive.

The latter might almost have been bestowed in irony, the former by way of parody] <span class="cmt_word">the son of Nebat</span> [The case of Jeroboam is now related at much greater length, not so much because of the importance of the rebellion at the time, as because of its bearing on the later history of Israel.

It was the first great symptom of the decadence of the <span class="accented">power</span> of Solomon; of his decline in <span class="accented">piety</span> we have had many indications.

That this place was apparently situate in the tribe of Manasseh, is no argument against the identification (Bahr), for an Ephrathite might surely be born out of Ephraim. It is, however, observable that Zereda has the definite article (similarly <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> the LXX., but this place is located in <span class="accented">Mount</span> Ephraim), which Zarthan, etc., have not.
