This reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society, where women often acted under the direction of their husbands. Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, sought divine insight through Ahijah, who had previously prophesied his rise to power (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). This action underscores the belief in prophetic authority and the desire for divine guidance in times of crisis.<p><b>she arose and went to Shiloh</b><br>Shiloh was a significant religious center in Israel before the establishment of Jerusalem as the central place of worship. It was the location of the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant during the time of the Judges (<a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>). The journey to Shiloh indicates the continued recognition of its spiritual importance, even after the division of the kingdom. This journey also highlights the physical and spiritual pilgrimage undertaken to seek God's will.<p><b>and arrived at Ahijah&#8217;s house.</b><br>Ahijah the prophet resided in Shiloh, and his home became a place of divine revelation. Prophets often served as intermediaries between God and the people, providing guidance and insight. Ahijah's previous prophecy concerning Jeroboam's kingship (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>) established his credibility and authority. The arrival at his house signifies the expectation of receiving a message from God.<p><b>Now Ahijah could not see,</b><br>Ahijah's blindness is a physical condition that contrasts with his spiritual insight. In biblical literature, physical blindness often serves as a metaphor for spiritual insight or lack thereof. Despite his inability to see physically, Ahijah's prophetic vision remained clear, emphasizing the theme that true sight comes from spiritual understanding rather than physical ability.<p><b>for his eyes were dim because of his age.</b><br>The dimming of Ahijah's eyes due to age is a common biblical motif, seen also in the stories of Isaac (<a href="/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27:1</a>) and Eli (<a href="/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a>). This detail underscores the natural human frailty and the passage of time. Despite his physical limitations, Ahijah's role as a prophet was not diminished, highlighting the belief that God's power and wisdom transcend human weakness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

Jeroboam&#8217;s wife obeys her husband&#8217;s covert instructions, journeys to the historically sacred town of Shiloh, and reaches the house of the aged, blind prophet Ahijah. Each detail exposes human schemes and magnifies God&#8217;s sovereignty: the queen&#8217;s disguise cannot fool the LORD; the true word comes from an old prophet outside the centers of power; and physical blindness only accentuates spiritual sight. The verse prepares us for the sobering message that follows&#8212;God&#8217;s righteous judgment on Jeroboam&#8217;s idolatry&#8212;while reminding us that His truth pierces every disguise and prevails over every human plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Were set.</span>--The same word is rendered "were dim" in <a href="/1_samuel/4-15.htm" title="Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.">1Samuel 4:15</a>.
