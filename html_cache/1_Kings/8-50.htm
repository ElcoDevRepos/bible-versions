The plea for forgiveness acknowledges the covenant relationship between God and His people, Israel. In the context of <a href="/1_kings/8.htm">1 Kings 8</a>, Solomon is dedicating the temple and interceding for the Israelites, recognizing their propensity to sin. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of human fallibility and the need for divine grace. The concept of forgiveness is foundational in both the Old and New Testaments, with passages like <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51 and 1</a> <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a> emphasizing God's readiness to forgive those who repent.<p><b>and all the transgressions they have committed against You</b><br>The term "transgressions" refers to acts of rebellion or violation of God's law. In the historical context, Israel often strayed from God's commandments, leading to periods of judgment and exile. This plea acknowledges the seriousness of sin and the need for comprehensive forgiveness. The use of "all" underscores the totality of their offenses, suggesting that no sin is beyond God's capacity to forgive. This is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where God invites His people to reason together and promises that their sins, though scarlet, shall be white as snow.<p><b>and may You grant them compassion in the eyes of their captors</b><br>This request for compassion from captors reflects the historical reality of Israel's exiles, such as the Babylonian captivity. It acknowledges God's sovereignty over the hearts of even foreign rulers, as seen in the stories of Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/39-21.htm">Genesis 39:21</a>) and Daniel in Babylon (<a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>). The plea for compassion is a recognition that God can influence circumstances and people to bring about His purposes, even in times of judgment and exile.<p><b>to show them mercy</b><br>Mercy is a key attribute of God, often associated with His covenant love (hesed) for His people. The request for mercy from captors is a plea for relief and favor, even when justice might demand otherwise. This reflects the biblical theme of God's mercy triumphing over judgment (<a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>). The ultimate expression of divine mercy is found in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who embodies God's mercy and offers redemption to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who is offering this prayer during the dedication of the temple.

We see this in the exceptional favour of Nebuchadnezzar and of the Ahasuerus of the Book of Esther to the Jews in Babylon; we see it still more in the greater boon of restoration granted them by Cyrus and Darius, and the Artaxerxes of the Book of Nehemiah. Like the whole course of the fortunes of the Jews in their subsequent dispersion, these things,--however they may be accounted for--are certainly unique in history.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">to</span> <span class="accented">compassion</span> or <span class="accented">bowels</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> = <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/6-12.htm">2 Corinthians 6:12</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-1.htm">Philippians 2:1</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them.</span> [For the fulfilment of this prayer, see <a href="/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3, 7</a>; <a href="/ezra/6-13.htm">Ezra 6:13</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-6.htm">Nehemiah 2:6</a>.
