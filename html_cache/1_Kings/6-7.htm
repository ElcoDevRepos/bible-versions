This method ensured that the temple site remained a place of peace and reverence, free from the noise of construction. The use of pre-cut stones signifies the importance of preparation and planning in the work of God. This practice also reflects the ancient Near Eastern custom of quarrying stones at a distance to maintain the sanctity of sacred spaces. Theologically, it can be seen as a type of the spiritual temple, the Church, which is built with "living stones" (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>), prepared and shaped by God for His purpose.<p><b>so that no hammer or chisel or any other iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built</b><br>The absence of construction noise at the temple site underscores the holiness of the location. In biblical times, iron tools were often associated with warfare and violence, and their exclusion from the temple construction can symbolize the peace and purity that should characterize worship. This practice is reminiscent of <a href="/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>, where God commands that altars be made of uncut stones, emphasizing the divine nature of worship spaces. The silent construction can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the peace brought by Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), who builds His Church in a manner that transcends human conflict and strife.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple.

It may have been suggested by the prohibition (see <a href="/exodus/20-25.htm" title="And if you will make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone: for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it.">Exodus 20:25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-5.htm" title="And there shall you build an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones: you shall not lift up any iron tool on them.">Deuteronomy 27:5</a>) of the use of tools on the altar of the Lord. But the idea implied in this prohibition was rather different--viz., the use for the altar of stones in their simple, matural condition, without "pollution" by the art of man. It has been chronicled in Heber's well-known lines:--<p>"No workmen's steel, no ponderous axes rung;<p>Like some tall palm the noiseless fabric sprung."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">perfect.</span> This does not mean <span class="accented">unhewn</span>, though <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> is undoubtedly used in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-6.htm">Deuteronomy 27:6</a> (cf. <a href="/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>) of unhewn or virgin stone; and Gesenius would so understand the expression here, But the context seems rather to convey the idea that the stones were not shaped <span class="accented">on the spot</span>. It was apparently the belief of the ancients that stones of proper shape and size were provided in their bed by God (so Theodoret and Procopius,) It is inconceivable, however, that no dressing or preparation of any kind would be required; an idea, moreover, which is contradicted by <a href="/1_kings/5-18.htm">1 Kings 5:18</a>. When Gardiner (in Bahr, American edition) quotes Keil (in his earlier work) as understanding "all unviolated stones of the quarry," he hardly does justice to that author, who straightway adds, "that is, not altogether unhewn stones... but stones that were so hewn and wrought in the quarry that neither hammer," etc. (see below). Similarly Thehius and Bahr] <span class="cmt_word">before it was brought thither</span> [so the Authorized Version renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;</span> but mistakenly. It means, the quarry (Gesenius, Keil. For the construction, see Ewald, 289<span class="accented">a</span>, and Gesenius, Gram. ed. Rodiger, p. 170.) The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> is used of quarrying in 1 Kings 5:31 (Heb.) <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 5:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span> Where was this quarry? The general idea is that it was in the Lebanon. And it is not to be denied that some of the massive substructions and cornerstones of the temple may have been brought from the mountain, along with the wood; but the bulk of the stone, there can be no doubt, was found much nearer home. Some of it, according to the Mishna (<span class="accented">Middoth</span>, 3:4), came from Bethlehem; but we can hardly be mistaken in believing that for the most part it was quarried in Jerusalem itself, under the very temple rock, and out of the vast caverns recovered some years ago by Dr. Barclay (see his "City of the Great King"), the "Royal Caverns" of Josephus. See "Quart. Journal," Pal. Explor. Fund (No. 7.), pp, 373, 374, and cf. p. 34. There are unmistakable evidences of these extensive caverns having served as a quarry. Not only are the walls cut straight, but rude masses are left here and there to support the roof, and, what is still more convincing, there are stones more or less cut out of the rock, and incisions are made where stones are to be quarried. There was no reason why the workmen should go far afield for stone when they had it, and of very excellent quality, at their own doors]: <span class="cmt_word">so that there was neither hammer</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and hammers.</span> Keil understands "finished stones of the quarry, and hammer, and axe." But the word "was built" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>), coming as <span class="cmt_word">it</span> does between "quarry" and "hammers," almost forbids this connexion] nor axe [Heb. <span class="accented">the axe</span>] <span class="cmt_word">nor any tool</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">every tool</span>] <span class="cmt_word">of iron heard in the house, while it was building.</span> [The historian remarks on this, not only because it was so unusual, but with the evident idea that it was a fulfilment of the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of the law (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-5.htm">Deuteronomy 27:5, 6</a>), which required the <span class="accented">altar</span> to be of virgin stones, untouched by tool of iron. If the quarries are to be identified with the "Royal Caverns," it is easy to understand how the temple rose up in silence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/6-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The temple</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hab&#183;ba&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
