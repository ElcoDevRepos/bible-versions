The term "ships of Tarshish" refers to large, sea-going vessels capable of long voyages, often associated with trade and wealth. Tarshish is traditionally thought to be a distant port, possibly in Spain, known for its wealth and trade connections. This phrase indicates Jehoshaphat's ambition to expand Judah's trade network and increase its prosperity.<p><b>to go to Ophir for gold</b><br>Ophir is a region mentioned several times in the Bible, renowned for its fine gold. The exact location of Ophir is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from the Arabian Peninsula to India or Africa. The pursuit of gold from Ophir highlights the economic motivations of Jehoshaphat's reign, as gold was a symbol of wealth and power. This endeavor reflects the broader biblical theme of seeking material wealth, which often comes with spiritual warnings.<p><b>but they never set sail</b><br>Despite Jehoshaphat's plans, the ships did not embark on their intended journey. This phrase suggests a thwarted ambition and serves as a reminder of the limitations of human plans when not aligned with divine will. It echoes the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>, "Many are the plans in a person&#8217;s heart, but it is the LORD&#8217;s purpose that prevails."<p><b>because they were wrecked at Ezion-geber</b><br>Ezion-geber was a port located near the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba, part of the Red Sea. It was an important maritime hub during the time of Solomon and Jehoshaphat. The wrecking of the ships at this location signifies a failed venture and serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of maritime trade in the ancient world. This incident may also reflect divine intervention, as seen in other biblical narratives where God disrupts human plans to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his efforts to follow the ways of the Lord, yet he made alliances that were not always wise.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/ships_of_tarshish.htm">Ships of Tarshish</a></b><br>Large, sea-going vessels intended for long voyages, often associated with wealth and trade.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/ophir.htm">Ophir</a></b><br>A region famous for its fine gold, representing wealth and prosperity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezion-geber.htm">Ezion-geber</a></b><br>A port city on the Red Sea, significant for trade and maritime activities.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wrecked_ships.htm">Wrecked Ships</a></b><br>The ships built by Jehoshaphat were destroyed before they could embark on their journey, symbolizing failed ventures.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_godly_alliances.htm">The Importance of Godly Alliances</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's alliance with Ahaziah, a king who did evil in the sight of the Lord, led to negative consequences.
