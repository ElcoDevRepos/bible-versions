This interaction highlights the political tension between Israel and Aram during this period. Ahab's response is significant as it reflects the pressure he faces from a powerful adversary. Historically, the Arameans were a formidable force, often clashing with Israel. Ahab's reign is marked by such conflicts, and his dealings with Ben-hadad are a testament to the ongoing struggle for power and dominance in the region.<p><b>&#8220;Tell my lord the king,</b><br>Ahab's use of the term "my lord the king" indicates a level of respect or submission, which may be strategic. This phrase suggests Ahab's attempt to maintain a diplomatic tone, possibly to avoid immediate conflict. In the ancient Near Eastern context, addressing a foreign king with such deference was common, especially when one was in a weaker position or seeking to negotiate terms.<p><b>&#8216;All that you demanded of your servant the first time I will do,</b><br>Ahab acknowledges the initial demands made by Ben-hadad, which he had agreed to fulfill. This concession might have included tribute or other forms of submission, reflecting the vassal-suzerain relationships common in the ancient world. The phrase "your servant" underscores Ahab's position of subordination in this negotiation, a tactic often used to placate a more powerful ruler.<p><b>but this thing I cannot do.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Ahab draws a line at the second set of demands, which were likely more severe or humiliating. This refusal marks a turning point, indicating Ahab's limits in terms of what he is willing to concede. The phrase suggests a moment of resistance, which could be seen as a stand for national sovereignty or personal pride. This decision sets the stage for the ensuing conflict, as Ahab's refusal would provoke Ben-hadad.<p><b>So the messengers departed and relayed the message to Ben-hadad.</b><br>The messengers act as intermediaries, a common practice in ancient diplomacy. Their role is crucial in maintaining communication between the two kings. The departure of the messengers signifies the end of this particular negotiation phase and the beginning of potential hostilities. This moment is pivotal, as it leads to the subsequent military actions described in the chapter. The narrative underscores the importance of communication and the consequences of diplomatic decisions in the biblical historical context.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The King of Israel during this time, known for his complex character and often criticized for his lack of faithfulness to God.

he personally dictates the reply, revealing that the king of Israel accepts responsibility for the moment. &#8226; Earlier, Ben-hadad&#8217;s siege (<a href="/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1-6</a>) had already stripped Ahab of courage. &#8226; Yet <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a> reminds us that &#8220;a gentle answer turns away wrath,&#8221; and Ahab&#8217;s calm yet firm reply models that principle despite his prior compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tell my lord the king</b><p>Ahab still addresses Ben-hadad with honorific language, acknowledging the Syrian ruler&#8217;s power without surrendering Israel&#8217;s sovereignty. &#8226; Compare David&#8217;s respectful but unwavering address to Saul in <a href="/1_samuel/24-8.htm">1 Samuel 24:8-15</a>; honor does not equal submission to sin or tyranny.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All that you demanded of your servant the first time I will do</b><p>Here Ahab repeats his earlier concession&#8212;yielding silver, gold, wives, and children (<a href="/1_kings/20-3.htm">1 Kings 20:3-4</a>). &#8226; His willingness shows the weight of fear (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>); Israel had often experienced foreign oppression when disobedient. &#8226; Yet the honesty underscores that God&#8217;s deliverance comes even to weak leaders, echoing <a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9-15</a> where flawed deliverers still experience divine rescue.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But this thing I cannot do</b><p>The second demand&#8212;that Ben-hadad&#8217;s servants freely plunder Ahab&#8217;s palace and the homes of his officials (<a href="/1_kings/20-6.htm">1 Kings 20:6</a>)&#8212;crossed a line. &#8226; Ahab finally sets a boundary, illustrating <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:7</a>: &#8220;a time to be silent and a time to speak.&#8221; &#8226; His refusal anticipates God&#8217;s intervention (<a href="/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13-14</a>), reminding us that courage often precedes divine aid (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). &#8226; Notice the phrase &#8220;cannot,&#8221; not &#8220;will not,&#8221; signaling moral impossibility; like Peter before the Sanhedrin (<a href="/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19-20</a>), he senses a limit beyond which obedience to man becomes disobedience to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the messengers departed and relayed the message to Ben-hadad</b><p>Communication returns to the aggressor, setting up the confrontation that follows. &#8226; The swift relay mirrors <a href="/proverbs/25-25.htm">Proverbs 25:25</a>: &#8220;Like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land,&#8221; yet here the news sparks anger rather than relief (<a href="/1_kings/20-10.htm">1 Kings 20:10-12</a>). &#8226; This turning point shifts the narrative from negotiation to warfare, positioning God to display His power through the prophet&#8217;s announcement (<a href="/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/20-9.htm">1 Kings 20:9</a> captures a decisive moment: a fearful, compromising king finally draws a God-honoring boundary. By honoring Ben-hadad respectfully yet refusing an unjust demand, Ahab unknowingly aligns with God&#8217;s forthcoming deliverance. The verse teaches that even hesitant obedience can become the hinge on which divine rescue swings, encouraging believers to speak truth with humility and courage when coercive powers press beyond rightful authority.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and</span>] <span class="cmt_word">he said unto the mcaeengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king</span> [He still employs the same obsequious language as in ver. 4], <span class="cmt_word">All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">can</span>] not do [At first sight it appears as if Ahab objected to the search (ver. 6), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, plunder, of his house and capital much more than to the surrender of his wives to shame and of his children to slavery.
