The "House of the Forest of Lebanon" was likely named for its extensive use of cedar wood, which was imported from the forests of Lebanon, a region renowned for its high-quality timber. This building served multiple purposes, including as an armory and a place for Solomon's court. The use of cedar symbolizes strength and durability, qualities associated with Solomon's reign. The name also evokes the imagery of a forest, suggesting a vast and majestic space.<p><b>a hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high</b><br>The dimensions of the House of the Forest of Lebanon indicate its impressive size and scale. A cubit is generally considered to be about 18 inches (45 centimeters), making the building approximately 150 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. These measurements reflect the grandeur typical of Solomon's constructions, paralleling the dimensions of the temple he built for the Lord, though the temple was more sacred. The size of the building underscores Solomon's wealth and the prosperity of Israel during his reign.<p><b>with four rows of cedar pillars</b><br>The mention of "four rows of cedar pillars" highlights the architectural sophistication and the use of high-quality materials. Cedar was a prized wood in the ancient Near East, valued for its resistance to decay and insects. The pillars would have provided structural support and added to the aesthetic appeal of the building. This detail also suggests a connection to the temple, which similarly used cedar wood, indicating a continuity in Solomon's building projects and a reflection of divine order and beauty.<p><b>supporting the cedar beams</b><br>The cedar beams supported by the pillars would have formed the framework of the roof, contributing to the building's stability and elegance. This construction technique reflects the advanced engineering skills of the time and the influence of Phoenician craftsmanship, as Hiram of Tyre, a Phoenician king, supplied materials and labor for Solomon's projects. The use of cedar beams also symbolizes the enduring nature of Solomon's kingdom, as cedar was known for its longevity. This architectural detail can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate support and foundation for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the construction of the House of the Forest of Lebanon.

It does not follow that this space of 100 x 50 cubits was all roofed in, for it would seem as if the house was built round a courtyard. Rawlinson remarks that a roof of 75 feet is "much greater than is ever found in Assyria." But it is by no means certain that there <span class="accented">was</span> any such roof here], <span class="cmt_word">and the height thereof thirty cubits</span> [the same as the temple], <span class="cmt_word">upon four rows of cedar pillars</span> [How these were disposed of, or what was their number, it is impossible to say. Thenius says they were 400, but this is pure conjecture. The description is so meagre and partial that it is impossible to form a correct idea of the building. The remark made above (ch. 6. Introd. Note) as to the temple applies with still greater force to the palaces. "There are few tasks more difficult or puzzling than the attempt to restore an ancient building of which we possess nothing but two verbal descriptions; and these difficulties are very much enhanced when one account is written in a language like Hebrew, the scientific terms in which are, from our ignorance, capable of the widest latitude of interpretation, and the other, though written in a language of which we have a more definite knowledge, was composed by a person who could never have seen the building he was describing" (Fergusson, Dict. Bib. 2. p. 658)], <span class="cmt_word">with cedar beams</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5bb;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> <span class="accented">cut</span> or hewn beams] upon the pillars. [This palace, according to Fergusson, was "the great hall of state and audience" and the principal building of the range. But if it was this, which is very doubtful, for the throne was in the hall of judgment (<a href="/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7</a>), it would seem to have served other purposes besides that of an audience-chamber. Among other things, it was certainly an armoury (<a href="/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>. cf. <a href="/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>). The Arab. Vers. calls it "the house of his arms." Possibly it was also the residence of the bodyguard (cf. <a href="/1_kings/14-28.htm">1 Kings 14:28</a> with 1 Kings 10:17). Bahr observes that the arrangement of the palaces accords with the Jewish conceptions of the kingly office. The first, the armoury, represents him in his militant character (<a href="/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>), the second in his judicial function (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5, 6</a>;
