Jeroboam was the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the united monarchy split following Solomon's reign. His reign is marked by idolatry and the establishment of alternative worship centers in Bethel and Dan to prevent Israelites from going to Jerusalem. This period is significant as it highlights the division between the northern and southern kingdoms, a division that had both political and religious implications. Jeroboam's reign is a backdrop for understanding the challenges Asa faced in maintaining the worship of Yahweh in Judah.<p><b>Asa became king of Judah</b><br>Asa's ascension to the throne marks a significant shift in the spiritual direction of Judah. Asa is noted for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry, contrasting with the practices in Israel under Jeroboam. Asa's reign is characterized by a return to the worship of Yahweh, and he is often compared to his ancestor David in his commitment to God. His reign is a fulfillment of the Davidic covenant, which promised a lasting dynasty to David's descendants. Asa's efforts to restore true worship can be seen as a type of Christ, who also sought to purify and restore true worship among God's people. Asa's reign is a reminder of the importance of faithfulness to God's commands and the blessings that come from obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>Asa was the king of Judah who reigned for 41 years.
