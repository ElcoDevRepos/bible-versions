This labor force was primarily composed of non-Israelites, as indicated in <a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20-21</a>, where it mentions the descendants of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. The use of forced labor can be seen as a fulfillment of Samuel's warning in <a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11-18</a> about the demands a king would place on the people. It also foreshadows the eventual division of the kingdom, as the heavy burdens imposed by Solomon contributed to the northern tribes' discontent (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>).<p><b>to build the house of the LORD</b><br>The construction of the temple was a significant event in Israel's history, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The temple replaced the tabernacle as the central place of worship and was a fulfillment of God's promise to David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>. The temple's design and construction are detailed in <a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6-7</a>, reflecting the grandeur and holiness of God. The temple also prefigures Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), indicating that He is the ultimate dwelling place of God's presence.<p><b>his own palace</b><br>Solomon's palace complex, described in <a href="/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7:1-12</a>, was a symbol of his wealth and power. It took thirteen years to complete, nearly twice as long as the temple, indicating the grandeur and scale of the project. The palace served as the royal residence and the administrative center of the kingdom. The construction of such a lavish palace can be seen as a reflection of Solomon's wisdom and prosperity, but also as a potential source of pride and excess.<p><b>the supporting terraces</b><br>The supporting terraces, or the Millo, were part of the fortifications of Jerusalem. The exact nature of the Millo is debated, but it likely refers to a series of terraces or earthworks that supported the city's structures. These fortifications were crucial for the defense of Jerusalem, which was strategically located and often under threat from surrounding nations. The construction of the Millo demonstrates Solomon's commitment to strengthening and securing his capital.<p><b>and the wall of Jerusalem</b><br>The wall of Jerusalem was essential for the city's defense and security. Fortifying the city was a priority for Solomon, as it was the political and religious center of Israel. The wall's construction reflects the importance of Jerusalem in God's plan, as it would later become the focal point of prophetic events and the ministry of Jesus Christ. The wall also symbolizes the protection and separation of God's people from the surrounding nations.<p><b>as well as Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer</b><br>These cities were strategically important for trade and military purposes. Hazor, located in the north, was a major Canaanite city that controlled trade routes. Megiddo, in the Jezreel Valley, was a key military site due to its location on the Via Maris, an ancient trade route. Gezer, near the Philistine border, was important for controlling access to the coastal plain. Solomon's fortification of these cities demonstrates his strategic acumen and the expansion of his kingdom's influence. These sites have been extensively excavated, revealing evidence of Solomonic construction, such as six-chambered gates, which align with the biblical account.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon's_palace.htm">Solomon's Palace</a></b><br>The royal residence of King Solomon, showcasing his wealth and power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/supporting_terraces.htm">Supporting Terraces</a></b><br>Also known as the Millo, these were structures built to support and fortify the city of Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hazor,_megiddo,_and_gezer.htm">Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer</a></b><br>Strategic cities in ancient Israel that Solomon fortified, demonstrating his political and military strength.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_greatness.htm">The Cost of Greatness</a></b><br>Solomon's achievements came at a significant human cost, reminding us to consider the ethical implications of our ambitions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prioritizing_god's_work.htm">Prioritizing God's Work</a></b><br>While Solomon built many impressive structures, the Temple was central.

The verse opens like a historian&#8217;s notation, inviting the reader to consider a factual record (cf. <a href="/1_kings/9-21.htm">1 Kings 9:21</a>; 2 Chron 8:4).<p>&#8211; Scripture often pauses to give a concise summary before expanding on details, underscoring that what follows is trustworthy.<p>&#8211; By prefacing the list of projects this way, the Spirit-directed writer affirms the reality of Solomon&#8217;s massive building agenda and anchors the narrative in verifiable history, much as Luke does in <a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3&#8211;4</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;of the forced labor that King Solomon imposed</b><p>&#8211; Solomon conscripted laborers from the remaining Canaanite peoples (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13&#8211;15</a>; 2 Chron 8:7&#8211;9).<p>&#8211; Israelite citizens were exempt from slavery yet still supplied shifts of corv&#233;e labor (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13</a>).<p>&#8211; While forced labor fulfilled God&#8217;s word about Israel subduing the land (<a href="/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>), it also foreshadowed later unrest (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>).<p>&#8211; The verse reminds us that even God-given wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>) does not eliminate the need for righteous administration (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;to build the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8211; The temple was Solomon&#8217;s first and greatest construction priority (<a href="/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8211; Its design mirrored heavenly realities (<a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>) and centralized worship in Jerusalem (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11</a>).<p>&#8211; Funding and manpower were lavish because God&#8217;s dwelling demanded the best (1 Chron 29:1&#8211;9).<p>&#8211; This labor accomplished what David had prepared (1 Chron 22:5), highlighting generational cooperation in God&#8217;s plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;his own palace</b><p>&#8211; Solomon&#8217;s royal complex took thirteen years&#8212;longer than the temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a>).<p>&#8211; Though legitimate, the extended timeline hints at the growing weight of royal ambitions (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8211; The palace stood beside the temple, symbolizing the intended harmony of throne and altar (<a href="/psalms/72-1.htm">Psalm 72:1</a>).<p>&#8211; Yet later kings would misuse such grandeur (<a href="/isaiah/22-15.htm">Isaiah 22:15&#8211;19</a>), showing the need for humble dependence on God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;the supporting terraces</b><p>&#8211; Also called the Millo, these terraces filled and reinforced the City of David&#8217;s slopes (<a href="/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>).<p>&#8211; They expanded buildable space and strengthened defenses, fulfilling earlier plans begun by David (<a href="/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>).<p>&#8211;

The Hebrew word seems to signify "piling up," or "heaping up," and its most simple meaning would be a "fortified mound." From the mention, however, in <a href="/judges/9-6.htm" title="And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.">Judges 9:6</a>; <a href="/judges/9-20.htm" title="But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.">Judges 9:20</a>, of the "house of Millo," in connection with the men of Shechem, it has been supposed to be a Canaanitish word; and it is possible that "the Millo" of Jerusalem may have been the name of a quarter of the old Jebusite city, especially as it is first used in connection with the narrative of its capture (<a href="/2_samuel/5-9.htm" title="So David dwelled in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.">2Samuel 5:9</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-8.htm" title="And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.">1Chronicles 11:8</a>). That it was a part of the fortification of "the city of David" is clear by this passage, by <a href="/1_kings/9-24.htm" title="But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.">1Kings 9:24</a> and <a href="/1_kings/11-27.htm" title="And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.">1Kings 11:27</a>, and by <a href="/2_chronicles/32-5.htm" title="Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.">2Chronicles 32:5</a>; and the LXX. invariably renders it "Acra," or "the-citadel," a name always applied in the later history to the fortification on Mount Zion. Josephus, in describing the works of Solomon, merely says that he made the walls of David higher and stronger, and built towers on them. From the derivation of the word it is possible that the work was the raising a high fortification of earth crowned with a wall, where the hill of Zion slopes down unto the valley known subsequently as the <span class= "ital">Tyrop?on</span>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> And this is the reason [or manner, account, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>.

The LXX. inserts this and the next nine verses after <a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>] of the levy [see on 1 Kings 5:13, and 1 Kings 12:18] which Solomon raised; for to build [The punctuation of the A.V. is misleading.

The import of the word is much disputed, but Wordsworth has but slight warrant for say. ing that it means fortress. According to some it is an archaic Canaanitish term, "adopted by the Israelites when they took the town and incorporated into their own nomenclature" (Dict. Bib. 2. p. 367), an idea which finds some support in <a href="/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 20</a>. Mr. Grove would further see in it a name for Mount Zion, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> being the invariable designation of that part of the city in the Maccabees. But see Joshua, B. J. 5:04.1; Ant. 15:11.5; and Porter, 1. pp. 96, 109. Lewin ("Siege of Jerusalem," p. 256) identifies it with the great platform on which temple and palace alike were built. But the word yields a definite meaning in the ( = aolm], "the filling in"). Gesenius Hebrew consequently understands it to mean, a rampart (agger) because this is built up and filled in with stones, earth, etc. And the name would have a special fitness if we might suppose that it was applied to that part of the wall of Jerusalem which crossed the Tyropaeon valley. This ravine, which practically divided the city into two parts, would have been the weakest spot in the line of circumvallation, unless it were partly filled in - it is now completely choked up by debris, etc. - and protected by special fortifications; and, if this were done, and we can hardly doubt it was done (see on 1 Kings 11:27), Hammillo, "the filling in," would be its natural and appropriate name. And its mention, here and elsewhere, in connexion with the wall, lends some support to this view] and the wall of Jerusalem [We learn from <a href="/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a> that David had already built Millo and the wall. Rawlinson argues from <a href="/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a> that these repairs had been "hasty, and had now - fifty years later - fallen into decay," and that Solomon renewed them. More probably the words indicate an enlargement of the Tyropaeon rampart, and an extension of the walls. See note there and on chap. 3:1. Solomon, no doubt, wished to strengthen the defences of the capital, on which he had expended so much labour, and where there was so much to tempt the rapacity of predatory neighbours] and Hazor [For the defence of the kingdom he built a chain of fortresses "to form a sort of girdle round the land" (Ewald). The first mentioned, Hazor, was a place of great importance in earlier times, being the "head of all those (the northern) kingdoms" (<a href="/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10</a>). It stood on an eminence - as indeed, for the sake of security, did all the cities of that lawless age (ib., ver. 13 marg.) - overlooking Lake Merom. It was at no great distance from the north boundary of Palestine, in Naphtali (<a href="/joshua/19-36.htm">Joshua 19:36</a>), and being favoured by position, it was strongly fortified - Hazor means fortress - and hence Joshua made a point of destroying it. It appears, however, to have speedily regained its importance, for in <a href="/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2, 17</a> we find it as the capital of Jabin, king of Canaan. It was selected by Solomon as the best site for a stronghold, which should protect his northern border, and as commanding the approach from Syria. As it is not mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>, it would appear to have escaped in the invasion of Benhadad. Possibly it was too strong for him] and Megiddo [<a href="/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>; <a href="/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>. This place was chosen partly because of its central position - it stood on the margin of the plain of Esdraelon, the battlefield of Palestine, and the battles fought there prove its strategical importance, <a href="/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a> (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1</a>); <a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>; Judith 3:9, 10 - and partly, perhaps, because the high road from Egypt to Damascus passed through it. It dominated the passes of Ephraim (see Judith 4:7). It has till recently been identified with el-Lejjun (from Legio. Compare our Chester, etc.) (Robinson, 2:116 sqq.; Stanley, S. and P., p. 347; Porter, 286, 287); but Conder ("Tent-work," p. 67) gives good reasons for fixing the site at the "large ruins between Jezreel and Bethshean, which still bears the name of Mujedd'a, i.e., on the eastern side of the plain] and Gezer [This commanded the approach from Egypt, and would protect the southern frontier of Solomon's kingdom. See <a href="/joshua/10-33.htm">Joshua 10:33</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-12.htm">Joshua 12:12</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>; <a href="/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-25.htm">2 Samuel 5:25</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4</a>. It stands on the great maritime plain, and is also on the coast road between Egypt and Jerusalem. The site was identified (in 1874) by M. Clermont Ganneau with Tell Jezer. The name means "cut off," "isolated" (Gesen.) "The origin of the title is at once clear, for the site is an out-lier - to use a geological term - of the main line of hills and the position commands one of the important passes to Jerusalem" (Conder, p. 6). The mention of Gezer leads to a parenthesis of considerable length (vers. 16-19). The question of the levy is put aside for the time, whilst the historian explains how it was that the king came to build Gezer. He then proceeds to mention the other towns built during the same reign. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/9-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1494;&#1462;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
