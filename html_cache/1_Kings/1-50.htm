His fear of Solomon arose after Solomon was anointed king by David's decree, supported by the prophet Nathan and others. This fear reflects the political tension and potential for retribution common in royal successions of the ancient Near East. Adonijah's actions demonstrate the precarious nature of power and the fear of losing it, a theme echoed in other biblical narratives such as Saul's fear of David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-12.htm">1 Samuel 18:12</a>).<p><b>got up and went</b><br>This phrase indicates a sudden and decisive action taken by Adonijah. The urgency in his movement suggests a realization of the immediate threat to his life. In the context of ancient Israel, fleeing to a place of sanctuary was a common practice for those seeking protection from vengeance or justice.<p><b>to take hold of the horns of the altar</b><br>The altar, located in the tabernacle and later in the temple, had four protruding corners known as horns. Grasping these horns was a recognized act of seeking asylum, as the altar was considered a sacred place where divine protection could be invoked. This practice is rooted in the belief that the altar was a place of God's presence and mercy, as seen in <a href="/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>, which provides a legal precedent for seeking refuge at the altar. The act of taking hold of the altar's horns symbolizes a plea for mercy and protection, foreshadowing the concept of seeking refuge in God, a theme that finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ as the ultimate sanctuary for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The son of King David who attempted to claim the throne of Israel without his father's blessing.

To take hold of them was, of course, to claim the right of sanctuary--a right, however, which the Law, ruled as usual by moral considerations, formally denied to wilful murder (<a href="/exodus/21-14.htm" title="But if a man come presumptuously on his neighbor, to slay him with guile; you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.">Exodus 21:14</a>), and which accordingly (see <a href="/context/1_kings/2-30.htm" title="And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said to him, Thus said the king, Come forth. And he said, No; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.">1Kings 2:30-31</a>) was refused hereafter to Joab. Adonijah, by the acknowledgment of "King Solomon," seems to represent his usurpation as one of those acts of haste and inadvertency, to which alone sanctuary was conceded.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Adonijah feared because of Solomon and he arose and went and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</span> [Cf. <a href="/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28</a>. Probably the altar of Mount Zion, <a href="/1_kings/3-15.htm">1 Kings 3:15</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>. Though it is impossible to say positively whether this or the altar at Gibeon (chap. 3:4) or that recently erected on the threshing floor of Araunah (<a href="/2_samuel/24-25.htm">2 Samuel 24:25</a>) is meant. For the "horns," see <a href="/exodus/27-2.htm">Exodus 27:2</a>; <a href="/exodus/38-2.htm">Exodus 38:2</a>; and compare Exodus 30:2.

As to the altar as a place of sanctuary, see on 1 Kings 2:28. Evidently a right of sanctuary existed amongst both Jews and Gentiles at the time of the Exodus, and probably from time immemorial. It is referred to in <a href="/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>, but it was much circumscribed by the appointment of the cities of refuge (<a href="/numbers/35-10.htm">Numbers 35:10</a> sqq.)
