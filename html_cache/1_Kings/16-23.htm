Asa was a king of Judah known for his religious reforms and efforts to rid the land of idolatry, as recorded in <a href="/1_kings/15-9.htm">1 Kings 15:9-24</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/14.htm">2 Chronicles 14-16</a>. His reign is often seen as a period of relative stability and faithfulness to God in Judah, contrasting with the turmoil and idolatry in the northern kingdom of Israel.<p><b>Omri became king of Israel</b><br>Omri's rise to power marks a significant turning point in the history of Israel. He was initially a military commander who became king after a period of civil unrest and conflict following the death of King Elah. Omri's reign is noted for establishing a new dynasty and bringing a measure of stability to Israel. He is also credited with founding the city of Samaria, which became the capital of the northern kingdom. Omri's political and military achievements are acknowledged in extra-biblical sources, such as the Moabite Stone, which refers to the "House of Omri."<p><b>and he reigned twelve years</b><br>Omri's twelve-year reign is significant for its impact on Israel's political landscape. His rule is characterized by strategic alliances and military campaigns that expanded Israel's influence. Despite his political success, the biblical narrative often highlights his continuation of idolatrous practices, which set a precedent for future kings of Israel. Omri's reign is a reminder of the tension between political power and spiritual fidelity, a theme prevalent throughout the books of Kings.<p><b>six of them in Tirzah</b><br>Tirzah served as the capital of the northern kingdom before Omri established Samaria as the new capital. The city is mentioned several times in the biblical narrative as a significant location in Israel's history (<a href="/1_kings/14-17.htm">1 Kings 14:17, 15</a>:21, 16:8-9). Archaeological evidence suggests that Tirzah was a fortified city, strategically located in the central hill country. Omri's decision to move the capital to Samaria reflects his desire to consolidate power and create a lasting legacy, as Samaria offered a more defensible position and greater political significance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/omri.htm">Omri</a></b><br>A significant king of Israel who established a new dynasty.

He then allied himself with the royal house of Tyre, probably both for strength against Syria, and for revival of the commercial prosperity of the days of Solomon, and proceeded to found a new capital in a strong position. That he was a warrior is indicated by the phrase, "the might that he shewed." Probably, like Jeroboam and Baasha, he also had his opportunity of restoring the spiritual strength of his people by returning to the pure worship of God, and threw it away, doing "worse than all who were before him."<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the thirty and first year of Asa, king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years</span> [As Omri was proclaimed king in the twenty-seventh and died in the thirty-eighth year of Asa (cf. vers. 15, 29), he cannot in any case have reigned twelve <span class="accented">full</span> years; whereas if his reign is to be dated, as it is here, from the thirty-first year of Asa, it is obvious that he would only have reigned seven, or, according to the Jewish mode of reckoning, eight years. Rawlinson proposes to get over the difficulty by rearranging the text. He would attach the first clause of this verse to ver. 22, and read, "And Omri reigned in the thirty-first," etc. But to this there are two serious objections. First, that ver. 23, as it now stands, only follows the usual formula with which a new reign is announced (cf. vers. 8, 15, 29); and, second, it is extremely doubtful whether any prose sentence in the Hebrew ever begins as ver. 23 would then do, "<span class="accented">Reigned</span> <span class="accented">Omri</span> over Israel twelve years."
