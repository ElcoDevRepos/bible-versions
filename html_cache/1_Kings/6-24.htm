A cubit is generally considered to be about 18 inches, making each wing approximately 7.5 feet long. The cherubim are symbolic of divine presence and protection, reminiscent of the cherubim guarding the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>). Their presence in the temple signifies the holiness and sacredness of the space.<p><b>and the other wing was five cubits long as well</b><br>The symmetry of the cherubim's wings emphasizes balance and order, reflecting the divine order established by God. This mirrors the detailed instructions given for the construction of the tabernacle in Exodus, where precision and adherence to God's design were paramount. The equal length of the wings also signifies completeness and perfection, attributes often associated with God's creation.<p><b>So the full wingspan was ten cubits</b><br>The total wingspan of ten cubits (approximately 15 feet) indicates the grandeur and majesty of the cherubim. This expansive wingspan would have covered a significant portion of the inner sanctuary, symbolizing the all-encompassing presence of God. The number ten in biblical numerology often represents completeness or divine order, further underscoring the perfection of God's dwelling place. The cherubim's wings touching each other and the walls of the sanctuary (as described in the surrounding verses) create a sense of enclosure and protection, akin to the wings of God sheltering His people (<a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem, a task that his father, David, had desired to complete.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_in_jerusalem.htm">Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy place constructed by Solomon as a dwelling place for the presence of God among His people, symbolizing God's covenant and faithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings depicted in the Holy of Holies, representing the majesty and holiness of God.
