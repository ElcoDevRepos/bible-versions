Solomon's wisdom and trade alliances, particularly with Hiram of Tyre, contributed to this prosperity. The abundance of silver signifies economic stability and prosperity, reflecting God's blessing on Israel. In biblical symbolism, silver often represents redemption and purity, pointing to the spiritual wealth available through God's covenant. The comparison to stones emphasizes the extraordinary nature of this wealth, as stones were plentiful and of little value in the region. This abundance fulfills the promise of prosperity given to Israel in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>.<p><b>and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills</b><br>Cedar wood, imported from Lebanon, was highly prized for its durability and fragrance, used extensively in Solomon's temple and palace. The mention of cedar being as abundant as sycamore indicates the vast resources at Solomon's disposal. Sycamore trees, common in the lowlands of Israel, were used for everyday purposes, contrasting with the luxury of cedar. This abundance of cedar reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to bless Israel with material wealth. The use of cedar in the temple construction also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who is the true temple and dwelling place of God among His people (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is renowned for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.

The sycamores of Egypt, which were used for the coffins of mummies (Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1394), are referred to in <a href="/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>, in a way which bespeaks their great value.

Conder ("Tent-work," p. 5) describes it as "consisting of low hills, about five hundred feet above the sea, of white soft limestone," and adds that "the broad valleys among these hills... produce fine crops of corn, and on the hills the long olive groves flourish better than in other districts" - an incidental and valuable confirmation of the text.
