In the ancient Near East, trade was a significant source of wealth, and Israel's strategic location made it a hub for commerce. Solomon's wisdom and administrative skills allowed him to capitalize on this, establishing trade alliances and routes that brought in substantial revenue. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Solomon of wealth and prosperity (<a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>).<p><b>traders</b><br>The mention of traders indicates the presence of a thriving economy under Solomon's reign. Traders would have included those dealing in goods such as spices, textiles, and precious metals. The economic activity facilitated by these traders contributed to the prosperity of Israel. This prosperity is a testament to the peace and stability Solomon's reign brought, allowing for such economic growth, as seen in the broader narrative of 1 Kings.<p><b>and all the Arabian kings</b><br>The Arabian kings refer to the rulers of the regions to the south and east of Israel, known for their wealth in spices, gold, and other luxury goods. These kings likely paid tribute to Solomon, recognizing his power and influence. This relationship underscores the extent of Solomon's influence and the fulfillment of the Abrahamic promise that Israel would be a blessing to the nations (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>).<p><b>and governors of the land</b><br>Governors of the land would have been local rulers or officials who managed different regions within Solomon's kingdom. Their mention indicates a well-organized administrative system that Solomon established to manage his vast empire. This system allowed for efficient collection of taxes and tributes, contributing to the king's wealth. The structure of governance under Solomon can be seen as a type of the order and peace that Christ, the ultimate King, will bring in His kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.

In other words, the inspired writer is saying, &#8220;That already-staggering sum wasn&#8217;t the whole story.&#8221; This amplifies the scale of Solomon&#8217;s prosperity&#8212;a fulfillment of God&#8217;s promise in <a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>. A parallel note appears in <a href="/2_chronicles/9-14.htm">2 Chronicles 9:14</a>, reinforcing that Scripture is consistent in underscoring the extraordinary blessing poured out on the king.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the merchants</b><p>Commercial guilds doing business in Israel&#8217;s busy trade corridors brought additional gold and goods into Solomon&#8217;s coffers. &#8226; Israel sat on the land bridge between Africa, Asia, and Europe, and the king capitalized on that geography (see <a href="/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28&#8211;29</a>). &#8226; Goods from Egypt, Cilicia, and beyond flowed through his markets. The text simply accepts this as fact, showing that wise stewardship of God-given opportunity can be a legitimate channel of blessing (compare <a href="/proverbs/31-18.htm">Proverbs 31:18, 24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>traders</b><p>These were itinerant dealers moving caravans across the desert routes (<a href="/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>). &#8226; Their levies and tariffs added to the king&#8217;s treasury just as customs duties do today. &#8226; <a href="/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26&#8211;28</a> notes Solomon&#8217;s venture to Ophir, indicating that his commercial reach was both land-based and maritime. The verse assures us there was no disconnect between Solomon&#8217;s &#8220;spiritual&#8221; life and his economic activity; both arenas displayed God&#8217;s favor when he walked in obedience (<a href="/1_kings/3-14.htm">1 Kings 3:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the Arabian kings</b><p>Desert chieftains to Israel&#8217;s south and east paid tribute, acknowledging Solomon&#8217;s supremacy. &#8226; <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10&#8211;11</a> anticipates kings bringing gifts to the son of David, and here in <a href="/bsb/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10</a> we see an early, literal fulfillment of that pattern. &#8226; Their offerings were not voluntary philanthropy; they were recognition of God-granted authority (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-10.htm">Deuteronomy 28:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and governors of the land</b><p>Domestic officials appointed over Israel&#8217;s twelve administrative districts (<a href="/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>) contributed their own quotas. &#8226; Each governor was responsible for feeding the royal household one month a year (<a href="/1_kings/4-27.htm">1 Kings 4:27</a>), and the collected fees they forwarded show the orderly structure of Solomon&#8217;s reign. &#8226; <a href="/romans/13-6.htm">Romans 13:6</a> later echoes the principle that governing authorities are &#8220;God&#8217;s servants,&#8221; financed by the people to maintain order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a> highlights the sheer breadth of Solomon&#8217;s income&#8212;commercial profits, caravan tariffs, foreign tribute, and domestic taxation&#8212;all on top of the famous 666 talents of gold. The verse testifies that when God grants wisdom and favor, material blessing can follow, yet it also foreshadows the danger of misplaced trust in riches (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>). Solomon&#8217;s prosperity was real, vast, and a direct fulfillment of God&#8217;s promise, inviting us to acknowledge the Lord as the ultimate source of every good and perfect gift.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">The governors of the country</span>.--The word "governor" (<span class= "ital">pechah</span>) is supposed to be of foreign origin--possibly cognate to the Sanscrit word <span class= "ital">paksha</span> "friend."

Perhaps the words are best explained by <a href="/jeremiah/25-24.htm">Jeremiah 25:24</a>: "The kings of Arabia (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>) and ... of the mingled people (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>) that dwell in the desert," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the desert of <span class="accented">Arabia deserta</span>, bordering on Palestine. The chronicler here gives us <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, not the Arabia of the geographers, but the tract of country south and east of Palestine, as far as the Red Sea (Gesenius). No doubt these kings, who were great sheepmasters, paid their tribute in flocks of sheep and goats (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and of the governors of the country.</span> [The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (cf. ch. 20:24) is a foreign word, perhaps Sanskrit, apparently borrowed by the Jews from the Persians. It is used of Tatnai (<a href="/ezra/5-6.htm">Ezra 5:6</a>), of Zerubbabel (<a href="/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a>), and of Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>). Probably our author, in whose day it was a familiar and well understood word, substituted it for some older Hebrew designation. But the office and character of these "governors" is more difficult to define than the name. Rawlinson thinks that, in some parts of the empire, the kings - the "empire of Solomon," he observes, "was in the main a <span class="accented">congeries</span> of small kingdoms" - "had been superseded by governors." But it seems as natural to understand the term of the twelve prefects mentioned in chap. 4, who were "the governors of the land," or of similar officers in the different outposts of the kingdom. We know that the contributions which passed through their hands were furnished <span class="accented">in kind</span>; hence, perhaps, it is that this income is distinguished from the gold of ver. 14. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/10-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">not including</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
