In the biblical context, the phrase "the LORD says" is often used by prophets to convey God's direct communication. It underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands, as seen throughout the Old Testament, where God's word is final and authoritative.<p><b>&#8216;You are not to go up and fight against your brothers, the Israelites.</b><br>This command highlights the unity that should exist among the tribes of Israel, despite political divisions. Historically, this refers to the period after Solomon's reign when the kingdom was divided into Israel (the northern kingdom) and Judah (the southern kingdom). The term "brothers" signifies the shared heritage and covenant relationship among the tribes, reminding them of their common ancestry and God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>Each of you must return home,</b><br>This directive to return home is a call to avoid unnecessary conflict and bloodshed. It reflects God's desire for peace among His people. Theologically, it can be seen as a call to trust in God's sovereignty and timing, rather than relying on human strength or military might. This echoes other biblical instances where God instructs His people to stand down, such as in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, where God tells the Israelites to be still and watch His deliverance.<p><b>for this is My doing.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase asserts God's sovereignty over the events unfolding in Israel. It reassures the people that the division of the kingdom is part of God's divine plan, as previously prophesied by Ahijah the Shilonite in <a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-39</a>. It serves as a reminder that God's purposes will prevail, even when they are not immediately understood by His people.<p><b>So they listened to the word of the LORD</b><br>The response of obedience to God's word is crucial. It demonstrates faith and submission to God's will, which is a recurring theme in Scripture. This obedience is contrasted with other instances in the Bible where disobedience led to dire consequences, such as Saul's failure to fully obey God's command in <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.<p><b>and turned back according to the word of the LORD.</b><br>The act of turning back signifies repentance and a change of course in response to God's command. It reflects a willingness to align with God's will, even when it requires humility and the abandonment of personal or political ambitions. This obedience is a model for believers, illustrating the importance of heeding God's guidance and trusting in His plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, whose harsh policies led to the division of the united kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, who led the ten tribes in rebellion against Rehoboam.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shemaiah.htm">Shemaiah</a></b><br>A man of God who delivered the LORD's message to Rehoboam and the people of Judah, instructing them not to fight against their fellow Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_israel.htm">Judah and Israel</a></b><br>The divided kingdoms after the split; Judah consisted of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, while Israel was made up of the other ten tribes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who intervenes to prevent civil war among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_word.htm">Obedience to God's Word</a></b><br>The importance of listening to and obeying God's instructions, even when they counter our own plans or desires.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_unity.htm">Value of Unity</a></b><br>The significance of maintaining unity and peace among believers, reflecting God's heart for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention.htm">Divine Intervention</a></b><br>Recognizing God's sovereignty and His ability to intervene in human affairs to accomplish His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/peacemaking.htm">Peacemaking</a></b><br>The call for Christians to be peacemakers, actively seeking to resolve conflicts and promote harmony.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>Encouragement to trust in God's wisdom and timing, even when His commands seem difficult or counterintuitive.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_12_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 12:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_12_24_God_s_role_in_Israel_s_split.htm">How does 1 Kings 12:24 demonstrate God's sovereignty over Israel's division?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_obedience_from_1_Kings_12_24.htm">What lessons on obedience can we learn from 1 Kings 12:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_Kings_12_24_Romans_8_28.htm">How does 1 Kings 12:24 connect with Romans 8:28 on God's purposes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_this_is_from_Me_to_challenges.htm">How can we apply "this thing is from Me" to personal challenges today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Divine_intervention_s_role_in_1_Kings_12_24.htm">What role does divine intervention play in resolving conflicts, as seen in 1 Kings 12:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_12_24_God_s_control_in_conflicts.htm">How does 1 Kings 12:24 reflect God's sovereignty over human decisions and conflicts?

LXX. inserts along addition, which differs from, and indeed contradicts, the Hebrew text in some important particulars. Rehoboam is represented as 16 years of age (Hebrews 40), as reigning 12 years (Hebrews 17); his mother is Naanan (Heb. Naamah), and is the daughter of Ana, son of Nahash, king of Ammon. Jeroboam is described as son of Sarira, a harlot. He is appointed by Solomon superintendent of the levy of Ephraim, and builds for him a city Sarira, and also completes the circumvallation of Jerusalem. He has 300 chariots and aims at royalty. Solomon seeking to slay him, he flees to Shishak, king of Egypt, who treats him with distinction, giving him the sister of his own wife in marriage. Here his son Abijah is born, when Rehoboam has been, something like a year upon the throne. After his birth, Jeroboam asks a second time to be released: he returns to his own country, takes up his abode at Sarira, fortifies it, and gathers the tribe of Ephraim round him. Here Abijah falls sick, and the visit to the prophet, narrated in chap. 14, takes place. The child dies; there is general mourning, after which Jeroboam goes to Shechem, and collects the tribes. Here the prophet Shemaiah (not Ahijah) tears a new garment in twelve pieces, gives him ten, and promises him the dominion over ten tribes. After which follow the events of vers. 5-24 of this chapter. The great circumstantiality of this narrative has led some scholars - Dean Stanley among them - to prefer it before the Hebrew version. But its details will not bear careful examination, and there is little doubt that it is a compilation of later date. Its untrustworthiness has been well shown among others by Rawlinson, Speaker's Commentary <span class="accented">in loc</span>. But he omits to notice what is perhaps its strongest condemnation, viz., that this LXX. addition is in conflict with the LXX. (and Hebrews) text of chap. 11. The account of Jeroboam's marriage with the sister of the queen, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., is manifestly a variation of the history of Hadad (ch. 11. ver. 19; see also ver. 22). Nor does it harmonize with the preceding history of this chapter, as given by the LXX. <p> CHAPTER 12:25-33. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL, AND THE SCHISM IN THE CHURCH. - The historian, after describing the great rebellion of the Jewish people, proceeds, in the rest of this chapter, to relate the measures which the new king took to secure his position. These were both external and internal. The external means were the erection of fortresses; the internal, the provision of new sanctuaries, priests, and ordinances. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/12-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">that this is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1441;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;You are not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to go up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;a&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and fight</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;il&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;m&#363;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural &#124;
