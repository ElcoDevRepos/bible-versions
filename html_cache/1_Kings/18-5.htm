Obadiah, his servant, is a devout believer in Yahweh, contrasting with Ahab's apostasy. This interaction highlights the tension between faithfulness to God and the political realities of serving a corrupt king. Obadiah's role is significant as he secretly protected the prophets of the Lord, showing his commitment to God despite his position in Ahab's court.<p><b>Go throughout the land</b><br>The command to search the land underscores the severity of the drought that Elijah had prophesied (<a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>). This drought was a direct judgment from God due to Israel's idolatry. The land of Israel, known for its agricultural fertility, was suffering, emphasizing the consequences of turning away from God. This search also reflects the desperation of the situation, as the king himself is involved in the effort to find resources.<p><b>to every spring and every valley</b><br>Springs and valleys were critical sources of water in the arid climate of Israel. The mention of these specific locations indicates a thorough search, as these areas would be the most likely to retain moisture during a drought. This search for water is symbolic of the spiritual drought in Israel, where the true source of life, God, was being ignored.<p><b>Perhaps we will find grass</b><br>The hope of finding grass shows the dire need for sustenance for the animals, which were essential for transportation, agriculture, and military strength. Grass, a basic necessity, becomes a precious commodity, illustrating the severity of the drought. This reflects the broader theme of dependence on God for provision, as seen in other biblical narratives like the manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<p><b>to keep the horses and mules alive</b><br>Horses and mules were vital for the economy and military of ancient Israel. Horses were used in chariots, a key component of military power, while mules were used for transportation and labor. The survival of these animals was crucial for maintaining the kingdom's stability and defense. This concern for animals also highlights the broader impact of the drought on all aspects of life in Israel.<p><b>so that we will not have to destroy any livestock</b><br>The potential destruction of livestock indicates the extreme measures that might be necessary if resources are not found. Livestock were a sign of wealth and prosperity, and their loss would be devastating economically and socially. This phrase underscores the desperation and the lengths to which Ahab is willing to go to preserve his kingdom, yet it also highlights the futility of relying on human efforts without seeking God's intervention. This situation foreshadows the eventual confrontation between Elijah and the prophets of Baal, where the power of God is dramatically demonstrated.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his idolatry and marriage to Jezebel, which led Israel into sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/obadiah.htm">Obadiah</a></b><br>A devout believer in the Lord who served in Ahab's court.
