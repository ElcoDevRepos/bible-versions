Tyre was a significant trading hub in the ancient world, and Hiram's relationship with Solomon was mutually beneficial, as seen in their collaboration on the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. This journey from Tyre indicates Hiram's personal interest and investment in the agreement with Solomon, highlighting the importance of their alliance.<p><b>to inspect the towns that Solomon had given him</b><br>Solomon, in exchange for materials and labor provided by Hiram for the Temple and his palace, gave Hiram twenty towns in the region of Galilee. This area, while part of the Promised Land, was less developed and not as fertile as other parts of Israel. The act of giving towns was a common practice in ancient treaties and alliances, often used to solidify political relationships. However, the quality and strategic value of these towns were crucial for Hiram's acceptance.<p><b>but he was not pleased with them</b><br>Hiram's dissatisfaction suggests that the towns did not meet his expectations in terms of value or potential. This reaction could be due to the towns' poor agricultural prospects or their lack of development. The phrase indicates a potential strain in the relationship between Hiram and Solomon, despite their previous cooperation. This dissatisfaction is further emphasized in the subsequent verses, where Hiram refers to the towns as "Cabul," a term that may imply worthlessness or insignificance. This incident reflects the complexities of political alliances and the importance of equitable exchanges in maintaining diplomatic relations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram.htm">Hiram</a></b><br>The king of Tyre, a significant ally of King Solomon.

His direct presence hints at high expectations for what he was about to receive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to inspect the towns</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a> notes that Solomon had given Hiram &#8220;twenty towns in the land of Galilee&#8221; as partial payment for lumber and gold.<p>&#8226; Inspection was normal in covenant arrangements (cf. <a href="/genesis/23-17.htm">Genesis 23:17-18</a>, Abraham carefully viewing the field he bought). It affirms accountability&#8212;what is promised must match what is delivered.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, this moment reminds us that integrity honors God; both giver and receiver must walk uprightly (<a href="/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Solomon had given him</b><p>&#8226; The towns lay in Galilee, a region later blessed by Jesus&#8217; ministry (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-15.htm">Matthew 4:15-16</a>), but in Solomon&#8217;s day they were lightly settled and less developed than coastal Phoenicia.<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s choice may reflect strategic thinking: he kept Israel&#8217;s prime agricultural heartland while ceding marginal territory, yet he still fulfilled his obligation (compare <a href="/joshua/19-32.htm">Joshua 19:32-39</a>, the earlier tribal allotment of this area).<p>&#8226; The narrative confirms that land transfers were real and tangible, reinforcing the literalness of Scripture&#8217;s historical claims.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he was not pleased with them</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/9-13.htm">1 Kings 9:13</a> records Hiram&#8217;s blunt verdict: &#8220;What kind of towns are these You have given me, my brother?&#8221; and he names the region &#8220;Cabul,&#8221; sounding like &#8220;good for nothing.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Possible reasons for his displeasure:<p>&#8211; Inferior farmland compared to fertile Phoenician plains.<p>&#8211; Sparse population and infrastructure, meaning high development costs.<p>&#8211; Distance from Tyre&#8217;s maritime focus, making trade benefits minimal.<p>&#8226; Though disappointed, Hiram did not break the alliance; <a href="/2_chronicles/8-2.htm">2 Chronicles 8:2</a> indicates Solomon later rebuilt these cities, perhaps returning or improving them.

The episode teaches integrity in agreements, realistic assessment of resources, and the value of sustaining godly partnerships even when plans disappoint. God uses such ordinary transactions to advance His larger purposes, weaving human diplomacy into the tapestry of His redemptive story.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) The cities are said to have been in "the land of Galilee." The name <span class= "ital">Galilee</span>, signifying properly a "circle" or "ring" of territory, is used twice in the Book of Joshua for a region round Kedesh-Naphtali (<a href="/joshua/20-7.htm" title="And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-32.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.">Joshua 21:32</a>), lying to the north-west of the Lake of Gennesareth, and extending to the Waters of Merom. (See also <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>.) The western portion of this territory would lie nearly on the frontiers of Tyre, and so would suit well the purpose both of Hiram and of Solomon. The discontent of Hiram probably referred to the condition of the cities (which afterwards had to be rebuilt), not to their geographical position.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">were not right in his eyes</span>. It has been conjectured that Hiram had hoped for the noble bay of Acco or Ptolemais (Milman, Rawlinson), but surely he had seaboard enough already. It was rather corn lands he would most need and desire. His disappointment is amply accounted for by the fact that the country assigned him was a hungry and mountainous, and therefore comparatively useless, tract.
