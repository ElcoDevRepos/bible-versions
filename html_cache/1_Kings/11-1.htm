Despite his wisdom and the blessings bestowed upon him, Solomon's love for foreign women led him astray. This love was not merely romantic but also political, as marriages were often used to form alliances. However, these alliances came at a spiritual cost, as they introduced foreign influences and idolatry into Israel. This disobedience to God's command in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>, which warned against intermarrying with foreign nations to prevent turning away from God, foreshadows the division and downfall of the kingdom.<p><b>along with the daughter of Pharaoh</b><br>Solomon's marriage to Pharaoh's daughter was a strategic alliance, symbolizing peace and cooperation between Israel and Egypt. This union is significant as it represents the first recorded marriage between an Israelite king and an Egyptian princess, indicating Solomon's political acumen. However, it also marks the beginning of his spiritual decline, as it involved adopting foreign customs and religious practices, contrary to God's instructions in <a href="/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>.<p><b>women of Moab, Ammon, Edom, and Sidon</b><br>These nations were historically hostile to Israel, and their inclusion here underscores the extent of Solomon's alliances. Moab and Ammon were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37-38</a>), and their worship of Chemosh and Molech involved detestable practices. Edom, descended from Esau, had a long-standing enmity with Israel. Sidon, a Phoenician city, was known for its worship of Baal and Ashtoreth. Solomon's marriages to women from these nations introduced their idolatrous practices into Israel, directly violating God's covenant and leading to spiritual corruption.<p><b>as well as Hittite women</b><br>The Hittites were a powerful group in the ancient Near East, known for their advanced culture and military prowess. By marrying Hittite women, Solomon further expanded his political network. However, this also meant embracing their religious practices, which were incompatible with the worship of Yahweh. This phrase emphasizes the breadth of Solomon's alliances and the resulting spiritual compromise, which ultimately led to the kingdom's division after his death, as prophesied in <a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>.

By marrying women from nations God had named, he opened the door to idolatry that would fracture his heart and, eventually, his kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11&#8211;13</a>). The verse is a sober reminder that disobedience often starts with misplaced love and that no amount of past faithfulness offsets present compromise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1-8) The defection of Solomon is distinctly traced to his polygamy, contracting numerous marriages with "strange women." Polygamy is also attributed to David (see <a href="/context/2_samuel/3-2.htm" title="And to David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;">2Samuel 3:2-5</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-16.htm" title="And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.">2Samuel 15:16</a>), marking perhaps the characteristic temperament of voluptuousness, which seduced him into his great sin; but it was carried out by Solomon on a scale corresponding to the magnificence of his kingdom, and probably had in his case the political object of alliance with neighbouring or tributary kings. We find it inherited by Rehoboam (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/11-18.htm" title="And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;">2Chronicles 11:18-21</a>), and it probably became in different degrees the practice of succeeding kings. Hitherto, while polygamy, as everywhere in the East, had to some degree existed in Israel from patriarchal times, yet it must have been checked by the marriage regulations of the Law. Nor had there yet been the royal magnificence and wealth, under which alone it attains to full development. We have some traces of it in the households of some of the Judges: Gideon (<a href="/judges/8-30.htm" title="And Gideon had three score and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.">Judges 8:30</a>), Jair (<a href="/judges/10-4.htm" title="And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.">Judges 10:4</a>), Ibzan and Abdon (<a href="/judges/12-9.htm" title="And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.">Judges 12:9</a>; <a href="/judges/12-14.htm" title="And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on three score and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.">Judges 12:14</a>). Now, however, it became, in spite of the prohibition of the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm" title="Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>), a recognised element of royal self-indulgence--such as is described in <a href="/context/ecclesiastes/2-7.htm" title="I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:">Ecclesiastes 2:7-8</a>, and is perhaps traceable even through the beauty of the Song of Solomon. In itself, even without any incidental consequences, it must necessarily be a demoralising power, as sinning against the primeval ordinance of God, and robbing natural relations of their true purity and sacredness. But in actual fact it sinned still more by involving forbidden marriages with idolatrous races, with the often-predicted effect of declension into idolatry. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">And</span>.
