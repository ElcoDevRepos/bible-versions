The mention of Hadad being a "young boy" highlights his vulnerability and the precarious situation of his family. In biblical narratives, God often uses the young and seemingly insignificant to fulfill His purposes, as seen with David and Joseph. This phrase sets the stage for Hadad's later role in opposing Solomon, reflecting the theme of God raising adversaries against those who stray from His commandments.<p><b>had fled to Egypt</b><br>Egypt was a common place of refuge in the ancient Near East due to its political stability and distance from Israel. This flight to Egypt is reminiscent of other biblical figures who sought refuge there, such as Abraham and later, the Holy Family with Jesus. Egypt's role as a place of refuge and its complex relationship with Israel is a recurring theme in the Bible, symbolizing both protection and potential idolatry.<p><b>along with some Edomites who were servants of his father</b><br>The Edomites accompanying Hadad were likely loyalists to the Edomite royal family, indicating that Hadad had a support network even in exile. This detail underscores the political alliances and familial loyalties that were crucial in the ancient world. The Edomites' presence in Egypt also foreshadows future conflicts between Edom and Israel, as these exiles would harbor resentment and seek to reclaim their homeland. This situation parallels the broader biblical narrative of exile and return, a theme that resonates with the Israelites' own experiences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hadad.htm">Hadad</a></b><br>A member of the royal family of Edom who fled to Egypt as a child.

Just after &#8220;the LORD raised up an adversary against Solomon&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a>), Scripture narrows its focus to one specific opponent&#8212;Hadad the Edomite.<p>&#8226; Hadad&#8217;s name links him to Edom, the nation descended from Esau (<a href="/genesis/36-1.htm">Genesis 36:1, 8</a>). Earlier, David and Joab struck down the Edomites (<a href="/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13-14</a>). Now, against all odds, a survivor of that defeat steps onto the stage, showing how the Lord can sovereignly preserve a future instrument of discipline (<a href="/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Still just a young boy</b><p>&#8226; The verse stresses Hadad&#8217;s youth. He was not a seasoned warrior; he was a child, much like Moses placed in the Nile (<a href="/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3-10</a>) or Joash hidden in the temple (<a href="/2_kings/11-2.htm">2 Kings 11:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Humanly speaking, a youngster seems powerless, yet God often works through the weak (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>). By preserving Hadad as a boy, the Lord lays groundwork for events that will ripple into Solomon&#8217;s reign.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Had fled to Egypt</b><p>&#8226; Egypt repeatedly appears in Scripture as a place of refuge&#8212;Abram during famine (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a>), Jacob and his family (<a href="/genesis/46-3.htm">Genesis 46:3-4</a>), later even Joseph, Mary, and the child Jesus (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13-15</a>).<p>&#8226; For Hadad, Egypt provided shelter from Joab&#8217;s campaign in Edom. Yet Isaiah warns, &#8220;Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>). While Egypt offers temporary safety, true security rests in the Lord alone.<p>&#8226; Hadad&#8217;s sojourn in Egypt also mirrors Jeroboam&#8217;s later flight (<a href="/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>), highlighting Egypt&#8217;s ongoing role in Israel&#8217;s story.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Along with some Edomites</b><p>&#8226; Hadad did not escape alone. A small band of Edomites&#8212;likely relatives and loyal retainers&#8212;went with him. This echoes the loyal band that gathered around David in the wilderness (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often preserves a remnant (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). Here the remnant is not Israel but Edom, underscoring God&#8217;s meticulous care even over foreign nations (<a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Servants of his father</b><p>&#8226; These companions had been &#8220;servants of his father,&#8221; signaling Hadad&#8217;s royal lineage. His father was probably a prince or king within Edom&#8217;s ruling house (compare <a href="/1_kings/11-21.htm">1 Kings 11:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Their loyalty to the boy shows covenant-like devotion reminiscent of the men who followed Saul&#8217;s son Ish-bosheth (<a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8-10</a>). Such steadfast service equips Hadad for future leadership when he later &#8220;reigns in Edom&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-21.htm">1 Kings 11:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse foreshadows how unfinished business from David&#8217;s conquests will return to trouble Solomon, illustrating the principle that unresolved sin or conflict can resurface in the next generation (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>b).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/11-17.htm">1 Kings 11:17</a> records more than a flight; it depicts God quietly preserving an avenger who will rise against Solomon. Though Hadad was only a child, the Lord safeguarded him, supplied loyal companions, and positioned him in Egypt until the appointed moment. The verse showcases God&#8217;s sovereign control over nations and history, reminding us that He can turn even the smallest detail into a future instrument of judgment or blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That Hadad fled</span> [This word excludes the idea that he was carried off in infancy by servants, something like Joash, <a href="/2_kings/11-2.htm">2 Kings 11:2</a>], <span class="cmt_word">he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt</span> [cf. <a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a>];
