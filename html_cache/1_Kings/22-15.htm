His arrival is significant as he is known for speaking the truth of God, often in contrast to the false prophets who tell the king what he wants to hear. This moment highlights the role of true prophets in Israel, who are often marginalized or persecuted for their messages.<p><b>the king asked him</b><br>The king in question is Ahab, the ruler of the northern kingdom of Israel. Ahab's reign is marked by idolatry and conflict with the prophets of Yahweh, particularly Elijah. This interaction underscores the tension between Ahab's desire for favorable prophecies and the reality of God's messages delivered through His prophets.<p><b>&#8220;Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?&#8221;</b><br>Ramoth-gilead was a strategically important city located east of the Jordan River, in the territory of Gilead. It was a city of refuge and had been under Israelite control but was contested by the Arameans. Ahab's question reflects his desire to reclaim this territory, but it also reveals his reliance on prophetic counsel, even if reluctantly, due to the influence of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, who insisted on seeking the Lord's guidance.<p><b>&#8220;Go up and triumph,&#8221; Micaiah replied</b><br>Micaiah's initial response is sarcastic, mimicking the false prophets who assured Ahab of victory. This irony is a rhetorical device to highlight the king's preference for pleasing messages over truthful ones. Micaiah's tone is a critique of the superficiality of Ahab's court prophets and the king's own spiritual blindness.<p><b>&#8220;for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.&#8221;</b><br>This statement, while seemingly positive, is part of Micaiah's ironic approach. The true message from God, which Micaiah reveals later, is one of impending disaster for Ahab. This phrase serves as a test of Ahab's discernment and willingness to hear the truth. It also foreshadows the fulfillment of God's sovereign will, regardless of human plans, and points to the ultimate authority of God over the affairs of nations and kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micaiah.htm">Micaiah</a></b><br>A prophet of the Lord known for speaking the truth, even when it was unpopular or dangerous.

18:22).<p>&#8226; The narrative signals a contrast: a single faithful messenger versus a crowd eager to please.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the king asked him</b><p>&#8226; King Ahab addresses Micaiah directly, revealing that&#8212;even after rejecting him&#8212;he still craves a word from the LORD (<a href="/1_kings/22-7.htm">1 Kings 22:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; This question underscores human accountability: rulers cannot escape seeking God&#8217;s counsel, whether they intend to obey it or not (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?</b><p>&#8226;

his &#8220;or should we refrain&#8221; is polite formality&#8212;his mind is set (cf. <a href="/2_kings/5-12.htm">2 Kings 5:12-13</a> for similar royal self-assurance).<p>&#8226; God allows the question so that the king&#8217;s heart will be exposed (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go up and triumph, Micaiah replied</b><p>&#8226;

The scene dramatizes how flattery can lull leaders into disaster when they ignore authentic prophetic warning (<a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king</b><p>&#8226; The phrase mimics prophetic formula (&#8220;the LORD will deliver&#8221;), yet Micaiah knows God has decreed the opposite&#8212;Ahab&#8217;s death (vv. 17, 23).<p>&#8226; By mirroring empty assurances, Micaiah exposes the king&#8217;s hunger for confirmation, not revelation (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The LORD&#8217;s sovereignty shines: even deceptive messages serve His larger purpose of judgment on persistent rebellion (<a href="/ezekiel/14-4.htm">Ezekiel 14:4-5</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/22-15.htm">1 Kings 22:15</a> captures a dramatic pause before truth breaks through. Micaiah&#8217;s sarcastic consent unmasks Ahab&#8217;s predetermined will, highlights the emptiness of majority prophecy divorced from God, and prepares the way for the genuine verdict that follows. The verse reminds us that God&#8217;s counsel is not a rubber stamp for human ambition; it is a standard by which every heart and ruler will be tested.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Go, and prosper.</span>--Micaiah is a true disciple of Elijah in the defiant irony of the tone in which he takes up and mocks the utterance of the false prophets so bitterly as at once to show Ahab his scorn of them and him. But his message is couched in metaphor and symbolic vision, unlike the stern directness of the style of Elijah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?</span> [Same words as in ver. 6. There is an apparent studied fairness in this repetition. It is as if Ahab said, "Despite his prejudice against me, I will not attempt to influence his mind. I only deal with him as with the rest."] <span class="cmt_word">And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king</span>. [As Ahab's inquiry is the echo of the question of ver. 6, so is Micaiah's response identical with the answer of the prophets. He simply echoes their words, of which, perhaps, he has been informed by the eunuch. There was an exquisite propriety in this. The question was insincere; the reply was ironical (cf. <a href="/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>). Ahab is answered "according to the multitude of his idols" (<a href="/ezekiel/14-4.htm">Ezekiel 14:4</a>). He wishes to be deceived, and he is deceived. No doubt Micaiah's mocking tone showed that his words were ironical; but Ahab's hollow tone had already proved to Micaiah that he was insincere; that he did not care to know the will of the Lord, and wanted prophets who would speak to him smooth things and prophesy deceits (<a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>).] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/22-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Micaiah arrived,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
