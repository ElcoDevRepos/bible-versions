The number three often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in the Bible, as seen in the Trinity or Jesus' resurrection on the third day. This period may also reflect a time of testing or probation for Shimei, who had been under house arrest in Jerusalem.<p><b>however, two of Shimei&#8217;s slaves ran away</b><br>The mention of slaves highlights the social and economic structures of ancient Israel, where slavery was a common practice. The escape of the slaves could symbolize a breach in Shimei's household, reflecting his inability to maintain control. This event sets the stage for Shimei's eventual downfall, as it tests his obedience to Solomon's command to remain in Jerusalem.<p><b>to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath</b><br>Gath was one of the five Philistine cities and often an enemy of Israel. Achish, the king, is a recurring figure in the biblical narrative, known for his interactions with David (<a href="/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10-15</a>). The mention of Gath may evoke memories of David's complex relationship with the Philistines, highlighting the ongoing tension between Israel and its neighbors. This connection to Achish also underscores the political dynamics of the region, where alliances and enmities were fluid.<p><b>And Shimei was told,</b><br>This phrase suggests the presence of informants or a network of communication within the kingdom. It reflects the vigilance of Solomon's administration in monitoring potential threats. The passive construction implies that Shimei's actions were under scrutiny, reinforcing the idea that his movements were being watched closely.<p><b>&#8220;Look, your slaves are in Gath.&#8221;</b><br>The direct speech emphasizes the urgency and importance of the information. Gath, as a Philistine city, represents a place of refuge for those fleeing Israelite authority, similar to David's earlier experiences. The mention of Gath may also symbolize a crossing of boundaries, both geographically and in terms of loyalty. This situation tests Shimei's allegiance to Solomon, as his response will determine his fate.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shimei.htm">Shimei</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Benjamin who had previously cursed King David but was later spared by him.
