(Josephus, characteristically enough, omits it altogether.) The one idea to be conveyed is the delusion of the false prophets by a spirit of evil, as a judgment of God on Ahab's sin, and on their degradation of the prophetic office. The imagery is borrowed from the occasion. It is obviously drawn from the analogy of a royal court, where, as is the case before Micaiah's eyes, the king seeks counsel against his enemies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Hear thou</span> [in <a href="/2_chronicles/18-18.htm">2 Chronicles 18:18</a>, <span class="accented">Hear ye</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>therefore</span> [The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, whence it would almost appear that they had the text <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> before them (Bahr).
