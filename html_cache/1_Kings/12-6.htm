The act of consulting with elders was a common practice in ancient Israel, reflecting a respect for wisdom and experience. Elders were often seen as repositories of tradition and guidance, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which emphasizes the value of counsel. This consultation indicates Rehoboam's initial willingness to seek guidance, a trait that was highly valued in Israelite leadership.<p><b>who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime.</b><br>These elders had firsthand experience with Solomon's reign, which was marked by prosperity and peace. They would have been familiar with Solomon's policies and the challenges of governing a united kingdom. Their service under Solomon suggests they had witnessed the benefits of wisdom and discernment, qualities Solomon was renowned for, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>. Their counsel would have been informed by the successes and failures of Solomon's administration.<p><b>&#8220;How do you advise me to respond to these people?&#8221; he asked.</b><br>Rehoboam's question pertains to the request from the Israelites to lighten the heavy yoke imposed by Solomon, as detailed earlier in <a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>. This moment is pivotal, as it reflects the tension between the northern tribes and the Davidic monarchy. The request for advice shows Rehoboam's recognition of the need for a strategic response to maintain unity. The phrase "these people" indicates a potential distance or disconnect between the king and his subjects, foreshadowing the division that would follow. This scenario echoes the biblical theme of leaders seeking divine wisdom, as seen in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, where believers are encouraged to ask God for wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Israel at this time.
