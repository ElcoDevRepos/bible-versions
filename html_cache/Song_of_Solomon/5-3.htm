In the context of the Song of Solomon, it symbolizes a moment of vulnerability and readiness for closeness. The robe can also represent the outer layers or defenses one might wear in daily life, suggesting a willingness to be open and transparent. Biblically, robes often signify identity or status, as seen in Joseph's coat of many colors (<a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3</a>) or the robe of righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>). The act of taking off the robe can be seen as a metaphor for shedding worldly concerns to focus on spiritual or relational matters.<p><b>must I put it back on?</b><br>This rhetorical question indicates reluctance to return to a previous state of readiness or activity. It suggests a tension between comfort and duty, or between personal desires and external demands. In the broader biblical narrative, this can be seen as a struggle between the flesh and the spirit, where one is called to respond to a higher purpose or calling, even when inconvenient. The question implies a hesitation to re-engage with the outside world, reflecting the human tendency to resist change or disruption once settled.<p><b>I have washed my feet&#8212;</b><br>Washing feet in biblical times was a common practice for cleanliness and hospitality, especially in a dusty, arid environment. It was often done before entering a home or after a journey, symbolizing purification and readiness for fellowship. In the New Testament, Jesus washing the disciples' feet (<a href="/john/13-5.htm">John 13:5-10</a>) serves as an act of humility and service, setting an example for believers. Here, the act of washing feet can represent a state of spiritual cleanliness and preparation for intimate communion.<p><b>must I soil them again?</b><br>This phrase underscores the reluctance to undo a state of cleanliness and purity. It highlights the desire to maintain a condition of sanctity and avoid the contamination of the world. In a spiritual sense, it reflects the Christian call to remain unstained by the world (<a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>) and to walk in holiness. The imagery of soiling feet can also be connected to the journey of faith, where believers are called to walk in the light (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>) and avoid paths that lead to sin or defilement.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, often interpreted as the Shulammite woman, who represents the beloved in the Song of Solomon. Her words reflect a moment of hesitation and reluctance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bridegroom.htm">The Bridegroom</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the bridegroom is the one seeking entry, symbolizing Christ in many Christian interpretations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chamber.htm">The Chamber</a></b><br>The setting is likely the private chamber of the bride, symbolizing a place of intimacy and personal relationship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_readiness.htm">Spiritual Readiness</a></b><br>The bride's hesitation serves as a reminder of the importance of being spiritually ready to respond to Christ's call.

Getting up feels inconvenient, even unnecessary.<p>&#8226; The reluctance shows how easily comfort can dull desire. Compare the warning in <a href="/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10&#8211;11</a> about a &#8220;little sleep&#8221; leading to loss and the call in <a href="/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11&#8211;14</a> to &#8220;put on the Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; because &#8220;our salvation is nearer now.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The beloved&#8217;s knock (Songs 5:2) echoes <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, where the Lord stands at the door and calls for immediate fellowship. To delay is to risk missing a moment of intimacy.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the robe pictures preparedness for communion and service (<a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35</a>). Setting it aside represents letting down one&#8217;s guard, becoming spiritually casual. When Christ calls, any hesitation exposes the heart&#8217;s misplaced priorities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have washed my feet&#8212;must I soil them again?</b><p>&#8226; In a dusty land, washing the feet meant the day&#8217;s duties were over (<a href="/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4</a>). The bride hesitates because stepping onto the floor will undo her evening cleansing.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/13-5.htm">John 13:5&#8211;10</a> shows Jesus washing the disciples&#8217; feet, teaching that those already bathed still need daily cleansing of walk and attitude. A pure walk is not maintained by avoiding service but by continual fellowship with the Lord.<p>&#8226; The bride fears soiling herself, yet the true defilement is indifference. <a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25</a> warns against outward cleanliness while the inside remains untouched. Here, her polished exterior masks a cooling affection.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3&#8211;4</a> reminds us that &#8220;clean hands and a pure heart&#8221; are required to ascend God&#8217;s hill. Purity is preserved, not lost, in responding quickly to His voice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/5-3.htm">Song of Solomon 5:3</a> captures a decisive moment: comfort urges the bride to stay put, but love calls her to rise. Literally, she hesitates over her robe and clean feet; spiritually, believers face the same tug between convenience and wholehearted response to the Lord. Scripture urges readiness&#8212;clothed in Christ, feet washed yet willing to get dusty again&#8212;so that when He knocks, we open without delay and enjoy unbroken fellowship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Coat.</span>--Heb. <span class= "ital">cutoneth=cetoneth;</span> Gr. <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>, tunic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</span> Evidently the meaning is, "I have retired to rest; do not disturb me." She is lying in bed. The <span class="accented">cuttoneth</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, was the linen garment worn next the body - from <span class="accented">cathan</span>, "linen." The Arabic <span class="accented">kutun</span> is "cotton;" hence the French <span class="accented">coton</span>, "calico, or cotton" shift. Shulamith represents herself as failing in love, not meeting the condescension and affection of her lover as she should. Sloth, reluctance, ease, keep her back. "Woe to them that are at ease in Zion!" The scene is, of course, only ideally true; it is not meant to be a description of an actual occurrence. Fancy in dreams stirs up the real nature, though it also disturbs it. Shulamith has forsaken her first love. She relates it with sorrow, but not with despondency. She comes to herself again, and her repentance and restoration are the occasion for pouring out the fulness of her affection, which had never really changed, though it has been checked and restrained by self-indulgence. How true a picture both of the individual soul and of the Church in its decline! "Leave me to myself; let me lie at ease in my luxury and my smooth, conventional ways and self-flattering deceit." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/5-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I have taken off</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1433;&#1496;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;&#353;a&#7789;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6584.htm">Strong's 6584: </a> </span><span class="str2">To strip off, make a dash, raid</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my robe&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1467;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(kut&#183;t&#257;&#183;n&#601;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
