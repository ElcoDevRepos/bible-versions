The act of opening signifies readiness and willingness to receive, yet the beloved's absence highlights the theme of missed opportunities and the consequences of spiritual neglect. In the context of ancient Near Eastern customs, the bride's action of opening the door would have been a significant gesture of hospitality and affection. Theologically, this can be seen as a call to be vigilant and responsive to Christ's presence, echoing <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, where Christ stands at the door and knocks.<p><b>My heart sank at his departure.</b><br>The emotional response of the bride indicates a profound sense of loss and regret. This mirrors the spiritual desolation felt when one realizes the absence of God's presence due to neglect or sin. The heart's sinking can be compared to the sorrow expressed in <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>, where the psalmist longs for God as a deer pants for water. Historically, the heart was considered the seat of emotions and will, emphasizing the depth of the bride's distress. This phrase serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a close and attentive relationship with God.<p><b>I sought him but did not find him.</b><br>The search for the beloved represents the soul's quest for divine communion. This pursuit is reminiscent of the parables of seeking in the Gospels, such as the lost sheep and the lost coin (Luke 15), illustrating the earnestness required in seeking God. The inability to find the beloved can be seen as a test of faith and perseverance, encouraging believers to persist in their spiritual journey despite apparent absence or silence from God. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>, where seeking God with all one's heart leads to finding Him.<p><b>I called, but he did not answer.</b><br>The act of calling out signifies a desire for communication and connection. The lack of response from the beloved can be interpreted as a period of divine silence, which is a common theme in the spiritual lives of believers. This silence is not indicative of abandonment but rather a time for growth and deeper trust in God's timing and wisdom. The experience of calling without receiving an answer is echoed in the lamentations of the psalmists, such as <a href="/psalms/22-2.htm">Psalm 22:2</a>, where David cries out to God but feels unheard. This phrase encourages believers to remain steadfast in prayer and faith, trusting that God's presence is constant even when not immediately perceived.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>Represents the bridegroom, often interpreted as Solomon or symbolically as Christ in Christian allegory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>Represents the Shulammite woman, symbolizing the Church or individual believers in a spiritual interpretation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_door.htm">The Door</a></b><br>A metaphorical barrier that the bride opens, symbolizing readiness and willingness to receive the beloved.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_departure.htm">The Departure</a></b><br>The beloved's absence signifies a moment of separation or missed opportunity for communion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_search.htm">The Search</a></b><br>The bride's active pursuit of the beloved, indicating a longing and desire for reconciliation and presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_readiness.htm">The Importance of Readiness</a></b><br>Just as the bride missed her beloved due to a delay, believers are encouraged to remain vigilant and ready for Christ's presence in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_pain_of_separation.htm">The Pain of Separation</a></b><br>The emotional response of the bride highlights the sorrow and longing that can occur when we feel distant from God, urging us to seek reconciliation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_pursuit_of_god.htm">Active Pursuit of God</a></b><br>The bride's search is a model for believers to actively seek God, even when He seems distant, trusting in His eventual presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_delay.htm">The Consequences of Delay</a></b><br>The missed opportunity to commune with the beloved serves as a warning against spiritual complacency and procrastination.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_perseverance.htm">The Call to Perseverance</a></b><br>Despite the initial absence, the bride's continued search teaches perseverance in faith and prayer, trusting in God's timing.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Song_of_Solomon_5_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Song of Solomon 5:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Song_of_Solomon_5_6_Seek_God_s_presence.htm">How does Song of Solomon 5:6 illustrate the importance of seeking God's presence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Emotions_in_Song_5_6_how_to_relate.htm">What emotions are expressed in Song of Solomon 5:6, and how can we relate?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Song_5_6_reveal_spiritual_longing.htm">How can Song of Solomon 5:6 deepen our understanding of spiritual longing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Song_5_6_Matt_7_7_on_seeking.htm">How does Song of Solomon 5:6 connect with Matthew 7:7 about seeking?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Steps_to_reconnect_with_God_in_5_6.htm">What practical steps can we take when feeling distant from God, as in 5:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_absence_key_in_Song_5_6.htm">What is the significance of the beloved's absence in Song of Solomon 5:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Song_of_Solomon_5_6_longing_theme.htm">How does Song of Solomon 5:6 reflect the theme of longing and desire?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Historical_context_of_Song_5_6.htm">What historical context influences the interpretation of Song of Solomon 5:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_song_of_solomon_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Song of Solomon 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/do_records_show_practices_like_song_5.htm">Are there any archaeological or historical records indicating cultural practices similar to the depictions in Song of Solomon 5, or is it purely literary imagery?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_do_watchmen_attack_her_in_song_5_7.htm">If the setting is historical, why would the watchmen attack the beloved in Song of Solomon 5:7 instead of recognizing her station or status?

The bride could not expect intimacy while remaining behind a locked door (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But he had turned and gone</b><p>&#8226; The shock comes immediately: &#8220;but he had turned and gone.&#8221; She opened, yet the opportunity slipped away (cf. <a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24&#8211;28</a>, where spurned wisdom finally withdraws).<p>&#8226; This is not fickleness on his part but the consequence of delayed response. Earlier hesitation (5:3) cost her a moment that could not be recovered.<p>&#8226; Similar warnings appear when the glory departs the temple (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18</a>) or when Samson awakens to find &#8220;the LORD had left him&#8221; (<a href="/judges/16-20.htm">Judges 16:20</a>).

The cry itself is worship, proving relationship still exists.<p>&#8226; The beloved&#8217;s silence invites deeper longing, purging complacency and heightening appreciation when fellowship is restored (<a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/5-6.htm">Song of Solomon 5:6</a> portrays the bride&#8217;s delayed response, the sudden loss of her beloved&#8217;s presence, the heartbreak that follows, and the earnest yet initially fruitless search that ensues. Taken literally, it cautions against sluggish obedience in any marriage: love must answer promptly. By wider biblical pattern, it also illustrates the believer&#8217;s experience with the Lord: hesitate, and the warmth of communion may withdraw; seek and call, and in due time He will be found. The verse therefore urges immediate, wholehearted responsiveness so that intimacy&#8212;whether in earthly marriage or in fellowship with Christ&#8212;need never be interrupted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">When he spake.</span>--We can suppose an ejaculation of disappointment uttered by the lover as he goes away, which catches the ear of the heroine as she wakes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone. My soul had failed me when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</span> The meaning is this - The voice of my beloved struck my heart; but in the consciousness that I had estranged myself from him I could not openly meet him, I could not offer him mere empty excuses. Now I am made sensible of my own deficiency. I call after him. I long for his return, but it is in vain (cf. the two disciples going to Emmaus, <a href="/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>, "Did not our heart burn within us," etc.?). Similar allusion to the effect of the voice of the beloved is found in Terence, 'And.,' 1:5, 16, "Oratio haec," etc. The failing or departing of the soul at the sound of the voice must refer to the lack of response at the time, therefore it was that she sought him and cried out after him. <span class="accented">When he spake</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in his speaking</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when he said, "I will not now come because at first refused;" cf. <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20-33</a>, the solemn warning against the loss of opportunity. It is a coincidence between the two books of Solomon which cannot be disregarded. If there is any spiritual meaning at all in Solomon's Song, it certainly is a book which he who wrote the first chapter of Proverbs is likely to have written. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">opened</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1444;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;&#7791;a&#7717;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6605.htm">Strong's 6605: </a> </span><span class="str2">To open wide, to loosen, begin, plough, carve</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for my beloved,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
