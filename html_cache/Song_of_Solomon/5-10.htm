The term "ruddy" indicates a healthy, reddish complexion, which in ancient Near Eastern culture was considered attractive and a sign of vitality. This imagery can be seen as a reflection of the idealized beauty and strength of the beloved, often interpreted as a type of Christ, who is both divine and human. The dual nature of Christ is highlighted here, with "dazzling" pointing to His divine glory and "ruddy" to His humanity. This description echoes the portrayal of David, who was also described as ruddy (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>), linking the beloved to the Davidic line and messianic prophecy.<p><b>outstanding among ten thousand</b><br>The phrase "outstanding among ten thousand" emphasizes the uniqueness and preeminence of the beloved. In the context of the Song of Solomon, this highlights the exclusivity and unmatched qualities of the lover. From a typological perspective, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's supremacy and singularity among all others. The number "ten thousand" is often used in Scripture to denote a large, innumerable quantity, suggesting that the beloved surpasses all others in excellence and worth. This echoes the New Testament portrayal of Christ as the one who is preeminent in all things (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>) and the only one worthy of worship and adoration (<a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>In the Song of Solomon, the beloved is often interpreted as a representation of Christ in allegorical readings, especially within conservative Christian traditions.

The red <span class="accented">adhom</span>, from the root <span class="accented">dam</span>, which means "to condense," is dark red (<span class="accented">rouge puce</span>), no doubt as betokening health and vigour. The pure, delicate white among the Caucasians denotes high rank, superior training, hereditary nobility, as among ourselves the "aristocratic paleness" (cf. Hom., 'I1,' 4:141, "<span class="accented">ivory with purple</span>;" Virg., 'AEn.,' 12:65; Ovid, 'Am.,' 2; ' Eleg.,' 5:39; Hor., Od., 1:13, etc.; Tibull., 'Eleg.,' ext. 4, etc.).
