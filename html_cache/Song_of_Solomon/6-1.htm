It highlights the communal nature of relationships in ancient Israel, where personal matters often involved the community. The question suggests a search for intimacy and connection, which can be seen as a metaphor for the soul's search for God. In a broader biblical context, this longing can be compared to the search for God&#8217;s presence, as seen in Psalms 42:1, where the psalmist longs for God as a deer pants for water.<p><b>O most beautiful among women</b><br>This title emphasizes the Shulammite's exceptional beauty and worth, which is recognized by those around her. It reflects the high esteem in which she is held, not only by her beloved but also by her peers. This phrase can be seen as a type of the Church, the Bride of Christ, which is described as spotless and without blemish in <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>. The beauty here is not merely physical but also spiritual, symbolizing purity and devotion.<p><b>Which way has he turned?</b><br>The inquiry about the direction the beloved has taken suggests a desire to follow and find him. This reflects the theme of seeking and finding that is prevalent throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>, where Jesus encourages believers to ask, seek, and knock. The directional aspect also implies guidance and the need for discernment in the spiritual journey, echoing the need for divine guidance as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>.<p><b>We will seek him with you</b><br>This expression of solidarity and support indicates a communal effort in the search for the beloved. It underscores the importance of fellowship and mutual encouragement in the spiritual journey, akin to the early Christian community described in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>. The willingness to seek together can also be seen as a reflection of the Church's mission to collectively seek and follow Christ, as well as to support one another in faith, as encouraged in <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The central figure in the Song of Solomon, representing the bridegroom.

Much like the bride in Songs 3:2-4 who rises to search the streets, they recognize that genuine love pursues; love does not remain passive (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>; <a href="/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Literally, Solomon has stepped away, and they want to know his location. Spiritually, the verse reminds believers that intimacy with the Lord can feel distant when we neglect fellowship (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The question also invites self-examination: if we sense distance, have we moved? <a href="/proverbs/8-17.htm">Proverbs 8:17</a> affirms, &#8220;Those who seek Me diligently will find Me.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O most beautiful among women</b><p>This title was first given by Solomon himself (Songs 1:8) and now echoed by the daughters.<p>&#8226; It affirms the bride&#8217;s value and purity, anticipating <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>, where Christ presents the church &#8220;without spot or wrinkle.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By repeating Solomon&#8217;s own words, the friends validate her identity. In the same way, believers are called to remind one another of our standing in Christ (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Worth is rooted in the beloved&#8217;s declaration, not in the bride&#8217;s feelings. When doubt arises, we go back to what the Bridegroom has said (<a href="/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Which way has he turned</b><p>Direction matters. The desire is not simply to find Solomon but to head the right way.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a> promises, &#8220;In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a> urges, &#8220;Seek the LORD while He may be found; call on Him while He is near.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The daughters model humility: they do not assume they know the route; they ask. Following Christ also begins with asking for His guidance (<a href="/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We will seek him with you</b><p>Love for the king becomes a shared quest.<p>&#8226; Community pursuit reflects <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>: stirring up one another to love and good works, &#8220;not neglecting to meet together.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Unity multiplies zeal. <a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a> calls believers to be &#8220;of the same mind, having the same love.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Partnership guards against discouragement. <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a> notes, &#8220;Two are better than one&#8230; if either of them falls, one can help the other up.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Song 6:1 records friends rallying around the bride: &#8220;Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Which way has he turned? We will seek him with you&#8221;. Their words affirm her worth, express genuine concern, seek clear direction, and pledge corporate pursuit. Literally, they want to reunite husband and wife; spiritually, the verse pictures believers encouraging one another to stay close to the Bridegroom, confident that those who seek will surely find Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>VI.</span><p>(1-3) <span class= "bld">Whither is thy beloved gone </span>. . . By a playful turn the poet heightens the description of the lover's beauty by the impression supposed to be produced on the imaginary bystanders to whom the picture has been exhibited. They express a desire to share the pleasures of his company with the heroine, but she, under the figure before employed (<a href="/context/songs/4-12.htm" title="A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.">Song of Solomon 4:12-16</a>), declares that his affections are solely hers, and that, so far from being at their disposal, he is even now hastening to complete his and her happiness in their union. Difficulties crowd on the dramatic theory at this passage. Most of its advocates have recourse to some arbitrary insertion, such as, "here the lovers are re-united," but they do not tell us how the distance from the harem at Jerusalem to the garden in the north was traversed, or the obstacles to the union surmounted. In the imagination of the poet all was easy and natural.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? Whither hath thy beloved turned him, that we may seek him with thee?</span> The dialogue still continues, possibly because, as Delitzsch suggests, the effect of the dream which Shulamith narrates is not passed away in the morning. Under the influence of it she goes forth and meets the daughters of Jerusalem, who offer their assistance. But there is no necessity for this. The poetry merely demands that the idea of the dream should be still kept before the mind of the reader. The scene is still in the palace. The ladies playfully carry on the bride's cue, and help her to pour out her feelings. The bridegroom, they know, is near at hand, and is coming to delight himself in his bride; but the bride has not yet drawn him back completely to her side. This is evident from the fact that there is no distress in the language of the bride. She is not complaining and crying out in agony under a sense of desertion; she is waiting for the return of her beloved, and so she calmly sings of his love and his perfect truthfulness, even though absent from her. He is where his perfect beauty and fragrance might well be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/6-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Where</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1434;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_575.htm">Strong's 575: </a> </span><span class="str2">Where?, whither?, when?, hither and thither</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has your beloved</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1428;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
