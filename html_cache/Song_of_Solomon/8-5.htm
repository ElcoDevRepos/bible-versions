The wilderness often represents a place of testing and transformation in Scripture, as seen in the Israelites' exodus (<a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16:1</a>) and Jesus' temptation (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>). The question "Who is this" suggests a sense of wonder and admiration, possibly indicating a transformation or revelation of the beloved's identity.<p><b>leaning on her beloved?</b><br>The image of leaning signifies dependence and intimacy, reflecting the deep trust and love between the bride and her beloved. This can be seen as a metaphor for the believer's reliance on Christ, echoing themes of divine support and companionship found in passages like <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a> and <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>. The beloved here is often interpreted as a type of Christ, highlighting the close relationship between Christ and the Church.<p><b>I roused you under the apple tree;</b><br>The apple tree may symbolize love and desire, as apples are often associated with beauty and romance in ancient literature. This setting could also suggest a place of awakening or realization of love, reminiscent of the Garden of Eden where life and knowledge began (<a href="/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a>). The act of rousing implies an awakening or stirring of emotions, possibly indicating a moment of spiritual awakening or renewal.<p><b>there your mother conceived you;</b><br>This phrase points to origins and lineage, emphasizing the continuity of life and love. It may also reflect the cultural importance of family and heritage in ancient Israel. The mention of conception underlines the idea of birth and new beginnings, which can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual rebirth, akin to the new birth in Christ (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>).<p><b>there she travailed and brought you forth.</b><br>The imagery of travail and birth highlights the pain and effort involved in bringing forth new life, paralleling the spiritual labor and growth in a believer's life. This can be connected to the concept of spiritual birth pains mentioned in <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>, where creation groans for redemption.

The verse calls believers to rest wholly on Christ, revisit their first love, and cherish the sacrificial foundations that undergird every God-given relationship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Who is this that cometh.</span>--This begins a new section, which contains the most magnificent description of true love ever written by poet. The dramatic theory encounters insuperable difficulties with this strophe. Again we presume that the theatre and the spectators are imaginary. It is another sweet reminiscence, coming most naturally and beautifully after the last. The obstacles have been removed, the pair are united, and the poet recalls the delightful sensations with which he led his bride through the scenes where the youth of both had been spent, and then bursts out into the glorious panegyric of that pure and perfect passion which had united them.<p><span class= "bld">Leaning upon her beloved . . .</span>--The LXX. add here <span class= "ital">shining white, </span>and the Vulgate, <span class= "ital">flowing with delights.</span><p><span class= "bld">I raised thee up.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">aroused: i.e., </span>I inspired thee with love. For this sense of exciting a passion, given to the Hebrew word, compare <a href="/proverbs/10-12.htm" title="Hatred stirs up strifes: but love covers all sins.">Proverbs 10:12</a>; <a href="/zechariah/9-13.htm" title="When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and made you as the sword of a mighty man.">Zechariah 9:13</a>. Delitzsch restores from the Syriac what must have been the original vowel-pointing, making the suffixes feminine instead of masculine.<p><span class= "bld">There thy mother </span>. . .--Not necessarily <span class= "ital">under </span>the apple-tree, which is commemorated as the scene of the betrothal, but near it. The poet delights to recall these early associations, the feelings with which he had watched her home and waited her coming. The Vulg. has here <span class= "ital">ibi corrupta est mater tua, ibi violata est genetrix tua, </span>which savours of allegory. So in later times the <span class= "ital">tree </span>has been taken to stand for the <span class= "ital">Cross, </span>the individual excited to love under it the <span class= "ital">Gentiles </span>redeemed at the foot of the Cross, and the deflowered and corrupted mother the <span class= "ital">synagogue of the Jews </span>(the mother of the Christian Church), which was corrupted by denying and crucifying the Saviour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-14.</span> - Part V. CONCLUSION. THE BRIDEGROOM AND THE BRIDE IN THE SCENE OF THEIR FIRST LOVE. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5a.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?</span> We must compare this question with the corresponding one in <a href="/songs/3-6.htm">Song of Solomon 3:6</a>. In that case the inhabitants of Jerusalem are supposed to be looking forth, and behold the bridal procession approaching the capital. In this case the scene is transferred to the country, to the neighbourhood of the bride's home, where she has desired to be with her lord. The country people, or the group of her relatives, are supposed to be gazing at the pair of lovers, not coming in royal state, but in the sweet simplicity of true affection, the bride leaning with loving confidence on the arm of her husband, as they were seen before in the time of their "first love." The restoration of "first love" is often the prayer of the disciple, feeling how far he falls short of the affection which such a Master should call forth. The first feelings of the heart when it is won to Christ are very delightful. <p><span class="accented">"Where is the blessedness I knew<br />When first I saw the Lord?<br />Where is the soul-refreshing view<br />Of Jesus and his Word?"</span> It is a blessedness when we come up from the wilderness. It is a joy to ourselves and a matter of praise to our fellow believers when we are manifestly filled with a sense of the Saviour's presence and fellowship. The word <span class="accented">midhbaur</span>, translated "wilderness," does not, however, necessarily mean a desolate and barren desert, but rather the open country, as the Valley of Jezreel The LXX. had either a different reading in the Hebrew or has mistaken it. They have rendered the last clause "clothed in white," which perhaps Jerome has followed with his <span class="accented">deliciis affluens</span>. The word is, however, from the root <span class="accented">rauvaq</span>, which in the hiph. is "to support one's self." The meaning, therefore, is, "leaning for support." It might, however, be intended to represent the loving confidence of married life, and therefore would be equivalent in meaning to the Greek and Latin renderings, that is, "Who is this? Evidently a young newly married wife with her husband." Perhaps this is the best explanation of the words as preparing for what follows, as the bridegroom begins at once to speak of the first love. Some think that the road in which the loving pair are seen to be walking brings their footsteps near to the apple tree over against Shulamith's house where they had first met. But there is no necessity for that supposition. It is sufficient if we imagine the apple tree to be in sight. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5b.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Under the apple tree I awakened thee; there thy mother was in travail with thee; there was she in travail that brought thee forth.</span> I awakened thee; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I stirred thee up to return the affection which I showed thee (cf. <a href="/songs/2-7.htm">Song of Solomon 2:7</a>). The Masoretic reading prints the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span>, as with the masculine suffix, but this renders the meaning exceedingly perplexed. The bride would not speak of awakening Solomon, but it was he who had awakened her. The change is very slight, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;</span> becoming <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;</span>, and is supported by the Old Syriac Version. It must be remembered that the bridegroom immediately addresses the bride, speaking of her mother. The apple tree would certainly be most naturally supposed to be situated somewhere near the house where the bride was bore perhaps overshadowing it or branching over the windows, or trained upon the trellis surrounding the house. The bridegroom points to it. "See, there it is, the familiar apple tree beside the house where thy dear self wast born. There, yonder, is where thy mother dwelt, and where thou heartiest my first words of affection as we sat side by side just outside the house under the shade of the apple tree." The language is exquisitely simple and chaste, and yet so full of the tender affection of the true lover. The spot where the first breathings of love came forth will ever be dear in the remembrance of those whose affection remains faithful and fond. The typical view certainly finds itself supported in these words. Nothing is more delightful and more helpful to the believer than to go over in thought, again and again, and especially when faith grows feeble, when the heart is cold and fickle under the influence of worldly temptations and difficulties of the Christian course, the history of the first beginning of the spiritual life. We recall how dear the Lord was to us then, how wonderful his love seemed to us, how condescending and how merciful. We reproach ourselves that we faint and fail; we cry out for the fulness of grace, and it is given us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/8-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">coming up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4480.htm">Strong's 4480: </a> </span><span class="str2">A part of, from, out of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the wilderness,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mi&#7695;&#183;b&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
