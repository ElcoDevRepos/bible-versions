Gold, often associated with royalty and divinity, suggests purity, worth, and honor. In biblical times, gold was a precious metal used in the construction of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>) and in the making of sacred objects, indicating something of great importance and reverence. The imagery of the head being like gold may also reflect wisdom and leadership, as the head is often seen as the seat of intellect and decision-making. This can be connected to the depiction of Christ in <a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>, where His head and hair are described with similar grandeur, emphasizing His divine authority and glory.<p><b>his hair is wavy and black as a raven.</b><br>The description of wavy, raven-black hair conveys youth, vitality, and attractiveness. In the ancient Near Eastern context, black hair was considered a sign of health and vigor. The comparison to a raven, a bird known for its glossy black feathers, enhances the image of beauty and strength. This imagery can be seen as a type of Christ, who is often depicted as the perfect and most desirable bridegroom in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>). The wavy nature of the hair might also suggest movement and life, indicating a dynamic and living presence. This aligns with the portrayal of Jesus as the living Word, full of grace and truth (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The primary subject of this verse, often interpreted as Solomon or a representation of the ideal lover.

The Bridegroom&#8217;s head gleams with that same radiance, suggesting wisdom that illuminates and guides His people (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; In contrast to Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s &#8220;head of gold&#8221; that would pass away (<a href="/daniel/2-38.htm">Daniel 2:38</a>), Christ&#8217;s head of gold is eternal. <a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>: &#8220;Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His hair is wavy and black as a raven</b><p>&#8226; The description shifts from regal splendor to vibrant vigor.

His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks; washed with milk and fitly set. His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as banks of sweet herbs; his lips are as lilies, dropping liquid myrrh. His hands are as rings of gold set with beryl; his body is as ivory work overlaid with sapphires. His legs are as pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold. His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</span> This description, which is complete in itself, is best regarded in its unbroken perfection. We must not expect to find a meaning for each separate part of it. There are ten corporeal excellences enumerated. We naturally recall the descriptions in Daniel and in the Apocalypse, which certainly have reference to this, and manifestly combine the attributes of greatness and beauty in the Son of man. Solomon, no doubt, as the son of Bathsheba, was distinguished by his personal attractions. Some of the details of description are differently rendered by different commentators. Delitzsch regards the description of the hair in ver. 11 as compared to a hill or hilly range" his locks hill upon hill," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "his hair, seen from his neck upwards, forms in undulating lines hill upon hill." The black colour is no doubt mentioned as a contrast with the fair, white complexion. The eyes are not only pure and clear, but with a glancing moistness in them which expresses feeling and devotion. So Plutarch has <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to denote a languishing look, and we find the same figure in the 'Gitagovinda ' and Hafiz, and in Ossian. So Luther, "Und stehen in der Falle." The pureness of the white of the eye is represented in the bathing or washing in milk. They are full and large, "fine in their setting," referring no doubt to the steady, strong look of fine eyes. "The cheeks" are compared to towers of plants; that is, there is a soft elevation in them. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;</span>: Jerome, <span class="accented">Sicut areolae aromatum consitae a pigmentariis.</span> The Targum says, "Like the rows of a garden of aromatic plants, which produce deep, penetrating essences, even as a (magnificent) garden aromatic plants" - perhaps referring to the "flos juventae," the hair on the face, the growth of the beard. "The lips" are described as the organs of speech as well as inviting to embrace. They drop words like liquid fragrance. "The bands" may be differently described according as they are viewed. Delitzsch says, "His hands form cylinders, fitted in with stones of Tarshish." Gesenius thinks the comparison is of the closed hand and the stained nails, but that seems farfetched. Surely it is the outstretched hands that are meant. The form of the fingers is seen and admired; they are full, round, fleshy like bars of gold. The word "Tarshish" may mean clay white, as in the Greek versions; that is, <span class="accented">topaz</span>, called Tarshish from Tartessus in Spain, where it is found. The description of the body is of the outward appearance and figure only, though the word itself signifies "inward parts." The comparison with ivory work refers to the glancing and perfect smoothness and symmetry as of a beautiful ivory statue, the work of the highest artistic excellence. The sapphire covering tempers the white. The beautiful blue veins appear through the skin and give a lovely tint to the body. So in the description of the legs we have the combination of white and gold, the white marble setting forth greatness and purity, and the gold sublimity and nobleness; intended, no doubt, to suggest that in the royal bridegroom there was personal beauty united with kingly majesty, as in the following description of his general aspect, which, like the splendours of the mountains, was awe-inspiring and yet elevating and delightful (cf. <a href="/psalms/80-11.htm">Psalm 80:11</a> (10): <a href="/jeremiah/22-7.htm">Jeremiah 22:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>). His mouth, or palate, is sweetness itself; that is, when he speaks his words are full of winning love (cf. <a href="/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-16.htm">Psalm 55:16</a>). We may compare with the whole description that given of Absalom, Solomon's brother, in <a href="/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25, 26</a>. It has been truly remarked by Zockler that "the mention of the legs, and just before of the body, could only be regarded as unbecoming or improper by an overstrained prudishness, because the description which is here given avoids all libidinous details, and is so strictly general as not even to imply that she had ever seen the parts of the body in question in a nude condition." It merely serves to complete the delineation of her lover, which Shulamith sketches by a gradual descent from head to foot, and, moreover, is to be laid to the account of the poet rather than to that of Shulamith, who is in everything else so chaste and delicate in her feelings. Certainly it would be much less delicate regarded as the description of a shepherd lover who is seeking to obtain possession of the maiden taken from him, than of the royal bridegroom to whom Shulamith is at all events affianced, if not already married. The highest spiritual feelings of loving adoration of the Saviour have welcomed some parts of this description, and adopted them into the language of "spiritual songs." To some minds, no doubt, it is repellent; to those to whom it is not so, the warmth and glow of Eastern language is by no means too realistic for the feelings of delight in the Lord which express themselves in rapturous music. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/5-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">His head</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#333;&#183;&#353;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
