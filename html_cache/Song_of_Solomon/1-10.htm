The mention of "cheeks" being beautiful with ornaments suggests a sense of dignity and honor. In biblical times, women often wore jewelry to signify status and beauty, as seen in <a href="/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>, where Rebekah receives a gold nose ring and bracelets. The cheeks, a prominent feature of the face, symbolize the visible expression of inner beauty and joy. This imagery can also be seen as a metaphor for the beauty of the bride of Christ, the Church, adorned with the righteousness and grace given by God (<a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>).<p><b>your neck with strings of jewels</b><br>The neck adorned with jewels signifies grace and elegance. In ancient cultures, necklaces were not only decorative but also indicative of wealth and social standing. The reference to "strings of jewels" suggests a lavish and intentional display of beauty. <a href="/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a> speaks of wisdom and instruction as a "graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck," indicating that spiritual adornment is of great value. This can be seen as a type of the believer's spiritual adornment in Christ, who is our wisdom and righteousness (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>). The imagery of the neck adorned with jewels also points to the Church, which is made beautiful and precious through the redemptive work of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

1:10 Mean</div><b>Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments</b><p>&#8226; The Bridegroom compliments the Bride&#8217;s cheeks&#8212;her visible, expressive face&#8212;highlighting the delight He takes in her appearance (Songs 4:3).<p>&#8226; Ornaments point to careful, loving adornment. Just as Abraham&#8217;s servant gave Rebekah &#8220;a gold nose ring and two gold bracelets&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>), the Bride is treasured and honored.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, cheeks can picture the believer&#8217;s public testimony. God clothes His people with &#8220;salvation&#8221; so they may &#8220;declare His glory&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The external beauty mirrors an inner reality; Paul speaks of Christ presenting the Church &#8220;without spot or wrinkle&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>).<p>&#8226; This line reminds us that our Lord does not merely tolerate His redeemed; He delights in them, actively beautifying them with His own righteousness (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your neck with strings of jewels</b><p>&#8226; In Scripture the neck often represents will and stance. A stiff neck is stubborn (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>), but a adorned neck is yielded and graceful (Songs 4:4).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Strings of jewels&#8221; suggests multiple, intentional graces placed upon the Bride, much like Joseph&#8217;s gold chain that signified honor and authority (<a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>).<p>&#8226; Proverbs links wisdom and loyal love to &#8220;a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>; 3:3). The Bridegroom&#8217;s jewels echo these virtues, showing how He equips His beloved for dignified living.<p>&#8226; Revelation pictures the Church as &#8220;prepared as a bride adorned for her husband&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>). The jeweled neck anticipates that final, complete adorning when the Bride stands in perfected glory (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, this calls believers to wear the ornaments Christ provides&#8212;humility, purity, steadfast love&#8212;so that what He sees in them is also seen by the watching world (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10</a> paints a loving Portrait: cheeks radiant with ornamented joy, neck graced with carefully strung jewels.

"Arab ladies, particularly the married, are extravagantly fond of silver and gold ornaments, and they have an endless variety of chains, bracelets, anklets, necklaces, and rings. It is also quite common to see thousands of piastres, in various coins, round the forehead and suspended from the neck, and covering a system of network, called suffa, attached to the back of the head-dress, which spreads over the shoulders and falls down to the waist" (Thomson, <span class= "ital">The Land and the Book</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p>Olearius (quoted by Harmer) says:--"Persian ladies use as head-dress two or three rows of pearls, which pass round the head and hang down the cheeks, so that their faces seem set in pearls." Lady Mary Montague describes the Sultana Hafitan as wearing round her head-dress four strings of pearls of great size and beauty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy cheeks are comely with plaits of hair, thy neck with strings of jewels. We will make thee plaits of gold with studs of silver.</span> This language may be suggested by the comparison first employed - the trappings of the horse. "The head frame of the horse's bridle and the poitral were then certainly, just as now, adorned with silken tassels, fringes, and other ornaments of silver. <span class="accented">Torim</span>, 'round ornaments,' which hang down in front on both sides of the headband or are also inwoven in the braids of hair in the forehead." The strings of jewels were necklaces - three rows of pearls. The ornamentation is, however, quite in accordance with female dress. The king makes the promise of gold and silver decoration as an expression of his personal delight in his bride and acceptance of her. Gold and silver were closely connected; hence silver was called, in the Old Egyptian language, "white gold." The idea seems to be that of silver points sprinkled over golden knobs. Compare the description in 'Faust' of Margaret's delight in the casket she finds in her room. The LXX. and Vulgate have mistaken the word <span class="accented">torim</span> for a similar word for "doves," taking the simile to be the beautiful colours of the dove's neck. The bride does not seem to reply immediately to the king; but we may suppose that the king takes his bride by the hand, and leads her into the banqueting chamber. But the next three verses, which are certainly in the lips of the bride, may be taken as her expression of delight in her husband, either while he feasts in the banquet or when it is over. The banquet is a familiar emblem of the delight of mutual love. Hence the feasts of love in the primitive Church were regarded, not only as seasons of fellowship between Christians, but times of rejoicing, when the soul entered into the full appreciation of the Saviour's presence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Your cheeks</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1497;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;ya&#183;yi&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fdc &#124; second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3895.htm">Strong's 3895: </a> </span><span class="str2">The cheek, the jaw-bone</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are beautiful</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;w&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4998.htm">Strong's 4998: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be at home, to be pleasant, beautiful</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with ornaments,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1512;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(bat&#183;t&#333;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8447.htm">Strong's 8447: </a> </span><span class="str2">A succession, a string, order</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your neck</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1512;&#1461;&#1430;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;aw&#183;w&#257;&#183;r&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6677.htm">Strong's 6677: </a> </span><span class="str2">The back of the neck</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with strings [of jewels].</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#363;&#183;z&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2737.htm">Strong's 2737: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pierced, a bead of pearl, gems, jewels</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/songs/1-10.htm">Song of Solomon 1:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/songs/1-10.htm">OT Poetry: Song of Solomon 1:10 Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings your (Song Songs SS So Can)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/songs/1-9.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Song of Solomon 1:9"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 1:9" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/songs/1-11.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Song of Solomon 1:11"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 1:11" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
