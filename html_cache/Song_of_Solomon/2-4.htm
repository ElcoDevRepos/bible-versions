The "house of wine" can be seen as a metaphor for a place of intimate fellowship and delight. In ancient Israel, wine was a symbol of blessing and prosperity (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). The imagery here may also evoke the idea of a banquet or feast, reminiscent of the marriage supper of the Lamb in <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>, where believers are invited to a divine celebration. The act of being "brought" indicates a deliberate action by the beloved, symbolizing Christ's initiative in drawing believers into a relationship of joy and spiritual abundance.<p><b>and his banner over me is love</b><br>In ancient military contexts, a banner was a standard or ensign that signified protection, identity, and belonging. Here, the banner represents the covering and protection provided by the beloved, which in a spiritual sense can be seen as the love of Christ for His church. This love is not just protective but also declarative, publicly identifying the beloved as cherished and valued. The banner of love signifies a covenant relationship, echoing the steadfast love of God as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>, where God declares His everlasting love for His people. This phrase also points to the sacrificial love of Christ, as demonstrated in <a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>, where Jesus speaks of laying down His life for His friends.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, often interpreted as the Shulammite woman, who represents the bride or the church in allegorical readings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lover.htm">The Lover</a></b><br>The one who brings the beloved to the banquet hall, often seen as Solomon or, in a spiritual allegory, as Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/banquet_hall.htm">Banquet Hall</a></b><br>A place of celebration and abundance, symbolizing a setting of love and joy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/banner.htm">Banner</a></b><br>A symbol of protection, identity, and proclamation, representing the overarching theme of love in the relationship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/love.htm">Love</a></b><br>The central theme of the verse, representing both romantic love and, in a broader sense, God's love for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_love.htm">Understanding Divine Love</a></b><br>The verse illustrates the depth and protection of God's love for us, akin to a banner that covers and identifies us as His own.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/celebration_of_relationship.htm">Celebration of Relationship</a></b><br>Just as the banquet hall is a place of joy, our relationship with God should be celebrated and cherished.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>The banner signifies our identity in Christ, marked by His love and sacrifice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/invitation_to_abundance.htm">Invitation to Abundance</a></b><br>God invites us to a life of spiritual abundance and joy, much like the banquet hall setting.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/protection_and_security.htm">Protection and Security</a></b><br>The banner over us is not just love but also a symbol of God's protection and security in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Song_of_Solomon_2_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Song of Solomon 2:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Song_of_Solomon_2_4_Christ_s_love_symbol.htm">How does Song of Solomon 2:4 illustrate Christ's love for the Church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_His_banner_is_love.htm">What does "His banner over me is love" signify in a believer's life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_divine_love_in_relationships.htm">How can we apply the concept of divine love in our relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Song_2_4_Eph_5_25_on_love.htm">How does Song of Solomon 2:4 connect to Ephesians 5:25 about love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_is_God_s_love_shown_in_Song_2_4.htm">In what ways can we experience God's love as described in Song of Solomon 2:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_His_banner_over_me_is_love.htm">What does "His banner over me is love" signify in Song of Solomon 2:4?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Song_of_Solomon_2_4_God_s_bond_with_us.htm">How does Song of Solomon 2:4 reflect God's relationship with believers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Historical_context_of_Song_of_Solomon_2_4.htm">What historical context influences the interpretation of Song of Solomon 2:4?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_song_of_solomon_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Song of Solomon 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/where_is_mount_ephraim_in_the_bible.htm">What does 'Do not awaken love until it pleases' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_love_theme_in_song_of_solomon.htm">What is the theme of love in Song of Solomon?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_sensuality.htm">What does the Bible say about sensuality?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_poetic_books_of_the_bible.htm">What are the Poetic Books of the Bible?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Song of Solomon 2:4 Mean</div><b>He has brought me</b><p>The bride opens by celebrating that the beloved took the first step.

The Hebrew word <span class="accented">yayin</span> corresponds with the AEthiopic <span class="accented">wain</span>, and has run through the Indo-European languages. The meaning is - To the place where he royally entertains his friends. Hence the reference which immediately follows to the protection with which the king overshadows his beloved. He covers me there with his fear-inspiring, awful banner, love, which, because of its being love, is terrible to all enemies. The word which is used for "banner" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>) is from a root "to cover," that which covers the shaft or standard; the <span class="accented">pannus</span>, "the cloth," which is fastened to a shaft (cf. pennon). Her natural fear and bashfulness is overcome by the loving presence of the king, which covers her weakness like a banner. Some versions render it as an imperative. There can be no doubt of the meaning that the banner is the military banner, as the word is always so used (see <a href="/psalms/20-6.htm">Psalm 20:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-52.htm">Numbers 1:52</a>; <a href="/numbers/2-2.htm">Numbers 2:2</a>). Perhaps there is a reference to the grandeur and military strength in which the young bride felt delight as she looked up at her young husband in his youthful beauty and manly vigour. The typical significance is very easily discovered. It would be straining it too much to see any allusion to the ritual of the Christian sacraments; but whether we think of the individual soul or of the people of God regarded collectively, such delight in the rich provisions of Divine love, and in the tender guardianship of the Saviour over those whom he has called to himself, belong to the simplest facts of believing experience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He has brought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1457;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1463;&#1433;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#277;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
