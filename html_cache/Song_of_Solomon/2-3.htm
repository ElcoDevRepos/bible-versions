In ancient Near Eastern culture, apple trees were valued for their beauty and fruitfulness, often symbolizing love and fertility. The comparison to a forest suggests that the beloved stands out among many, much like Christ is unique among all men. The apple tree can also be seen as a type of Christ, offering sustenance and refuge.<p><b>is my beloved among the young men.</b><br>The beloved is distinguished from others, emphasizing his exceptional qualities. In the context of the Song of Solomon, this reflects the deep admiration and love the bride has for her bridegroom. Spiritually, this can be seen as a reflection of the believer's love for Christ, who is unparalleled among men. The young men may represent worldly attractions, but the beloved surpasses them all.<p><b>I delight to sit in his shade,</b><br>Shade provides protection and comfort, symbolizing the safety and peace found in the presence of the beloved. In biblical times, shade was a precious commodity in the hot climate of the Middle East. This imagery can be connected to <a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>, where dwelling in the shadow of the Almighty is a place of refuge. It signifies the rest and security believers find in Christ.<p><b>and his fruit is sweet to my taste.</b><br>The fruit represents the blessings and joys derived from the relationship with the beloved. In a spiritual sense, this can be seen as the fruits of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>) that believers experience through their relationship with Christ.

The Shulammite sees her beloved as that single life-giving tree in an otherwise ordinary landscape. <a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a> speaks of the righteous &#8220;flourishing like a palm tree,&#8221; and <a href="/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a> likens the devoted believer to &#8220;a tree planted by the waters.&#8221; Likewise, the bride places her beloved in a category of his own&#8212;noticeably fruitful where others are barren.<p>&#8226; For us, the verse reminds that genuine love&#8212;and ultimately Christ Himself&#8212;outshines every rival (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>). He is not merely different; He is better, supplying what no one else can.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is my beloved among the young men</b><p>&#8226; The comparison shifts from trees to &#8220;young men,&#8221; underscoring personal choice.

In New Testament fulfillment, believers confess Jesus as &#8220;my Lord and my God&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>), singling Him out from every other figure who might claim authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I delight to sit in his shade</b><p>&#8226; Shade offers relief, protection, and intimacy. By choosing to rest beneath his branches, the bride declares both trust and enjoyment. <a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a> paints a similar picture: &#8220;He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;delight&#8221; signals not reluctant duty but eager pleasure.

Taste is personal and experiential. <a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a> urges, &#8220;Taste and see that the LORD is good.&#8221; The bride has done so and testifies to the sweetness.<p>&#8226; In the larger biblical story, Christ&#8217;s words and works are that nourishing fruit. He states, &#8220;I am the bread of life; whoever comes to Me will never hunger&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).

The bride&#8217;s Beloved is uniquely life-giving, preferred above all others, offering shade that protects and fruit that delights. In Him she rests and rejoices.

It has been very variously identified. The quince, the citron, the apple, and the apricot have each had their advocates.<p>The <span class= "ital">apple </span>may be set aside, because the Palestine fruit usually called the <span class= "ital">apple </span>is really the <span class= "ital">quince, </span>the climate being too hot for our apple.

The <span class= "ital">quince </span>is preferred by many, as being by the ancients consecrated to love, but it does not satisfy (2), being astringent and unpleasant to the taste till cooked. The <span class= "ital">citron </span>does not, according to Thomson and Tristram, satisfy (1); but according to Rev. W. Drake, in Smith's <span class= "ital">Bible Dictionary, </span>"it is a large and beautiful tree, gives a deep and refreshing shade, and is laden with golden-coloured fruit." The <span class= "ital">apricot </span>meets all the requirements, and is, with the exception of the fig, the most abundant fruit of the country. "In highlands and lowlands alike, by the shores of the Mediterranean and on the banks of the Jordan, in the nooks of Judiaea, under the heights of Lebanon, in the recesses of Galilee, and in the glades of Gilead, the apricot flourishes, and yields a crop of prodigious abundance. Many times have we pitched our tents in its shade, and spread our carpets secure from the rays of the sun. . . . There can scarcely be a more deliciously-perfumed fruit; and what can better fit the epithet of Solomon, 'apples of gold in pictures of silver,' than its golden fruit as its branches bend under the weight, in their setting of bright yet pale foliage?" (Tristram, <span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. of Bible, </span>p. 335). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</span> That these are the words of the bride there can be no doubt. The apple tree is noted for the fragrance of its blossom and the sweetness of its fruit; hence the name <span class="accented">tappuach</span>, from the root <span class="accented">naphach</span>, "to breathe sweetly." The trees of the wood or forest are specially referred to, because they are generally wild, and their fruit sour and rough, and many have no fruit or flower. The Chaldee renders, "citron;" Rosenmuller and others, "quince." The word is rare (see <a href="/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>; <a href="/joel/1-12.htm">Joel 1:12</a>). It is sometimes the tree itself, at other times the fruit. It occurs in proper names, as (<a href="/joshua/12-17.htm">Joshua 12:17</a>), "The King of Tappuah," etc., and that shows that it was very early known in Palestine. It occurs frequently in the Talmud. The word is masculine, while "lily" is feminine. "I sat with delight" is expressed in true Hebrew phrase, "I delighted and sat," the intensity of feeling being expressed by the piel of the verb. By the shadow is intended both protection and refreshment; by the fruit, enjoyment. Perhaps we may go further, and say there is here a symbolical representation of the spiritual life, as both that of trust and participation. The greatness and goodness of the tree of life protects and covers the sinner, while the inner nature and Divine virtue of the Saviour comes forth in delicious fruits, in his character, words, ministry, and spiritual gifts. If there is any truth in the typical view, it must be found in such passages as this, where the metaphor is so simple and apt, and has been incorporated with all religious language as the vehicle of faith and love. Hymnology abounds in such ideas and analogies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/2-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Like an apricot tree</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1433;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7791;ap&#183;p&#363;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
