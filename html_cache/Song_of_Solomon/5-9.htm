The inquiry suggests a comparison, asking what makes the beloved unique or superior. This can be seen as a reflection of the human tendency to compare and evaluate relationships. In a broader biblical context, this can be related to the uniqueness of Christ as the beloved of the Church, as seen in passages like <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>, where Christ is described as preeminent.<p><b>O most beautiful among women</b><br>The title "most beautiful among women" is a recognition of the Shulammite woman's exceptional beauty and character. This phrase highlights her distinctiveness and the admiration she commands. In a spiritual sense, this can be seen as a type of the Church, which is described as the bride of Christ, adorned and made beautiful through His love and sacrifice (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>). The beauty here is not just physical but also moral and spiritual, reflecting the inner transformation that comes from a relationship with God.<p><b>How is your beloved better than another</b><br>The repetition of the question emphasizes the curiosity and perhaps skepticism of the onlookers. It invites the Shulammite to articulate the qualities that make her beloved stand out. This can be seen as an invitation to testify to the unique attributes of Christ, who is often described in Scripture as having no equal (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>). The rhetorical nature of the question underscores the idea that the beloved's qualities are indeed unparalleled.<p><b>that you charge us so</b><br>The phrase "that you charge us so" indicates a sense of urgency or importance in the Shulammite's request. It suggests that her love and devotion compel her to seek the involvement or understanding of others. This can be likened to the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where believers are charged to share the gospel and the love of Christ with the world. The urgency reflects the transformative power of love and the desire to share it with others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The

women?</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;daughters of Jerusalem&#8221; address the bride as &#8220;most beautiful,&#8221; acknowledging the radiant change intimacy with her bridegroom has produced in her (Songs 1:8, 15; 4:7).<p>&#8226; Their question, &#8220;How is your beloved better than others,&#8221; is not cynical but curious; they sense a greatness in the one she loves and want to know why he stands apart (<a href="/psalms/45-2.htm">Psalm 45:2</a>; <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the scene pictures onlookers who recognize that those devoted to Christ possess a distinctive beauty (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>) and therefore inquire about the uniqueness of the Lord Himself.<p>&#8226; The bride is being invited to testify. As believers, we, too, are called to articulate why Jesus is &#8220;altogether lovely&#8221; (Songs 5:16) whenever others perceive His reflection in us (<a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How is your beloved better than another, that you charge us so?</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Charge&#8221; reflects the bride&#8217;s earlier appeal that the daughters help her seek the beloved (Songs 5:8). Her urgency compels them to ask for reasons behind such devotion.<p>&#8226; In practical terms, loyalty to a spouse is demonstrated through public praise; they want to hear her specific admiration (<a href="/proverbs/31-28.htm">Proverbs 31:28</a>).<p>&#8226; In redemptive terms, the Church&#8217;s longing for Christ should naturally overflow into persuasive witness, answering why He is worth pursuing above all rivals (<a href="/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The question sets the stage for the bride&#8217;s glowing description in verses 10-16, where she recounts the glory, strength, and charm of her beloved&#8212;a preview of the believer&#8217;s confession that Jesus surpasses every earthly affection (<a href="/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Song 5:9 portrays inquisitive observers drawn by the transformed beauty of the bride and her intense longing for her beloved. Their twin questions challenge her&#8212;and us&#8212;to articulate what makes the Beloved uniquely superior. The passage invites every redeemed heart to declare, with clarity and delight, why Christ alone is worthy of supreme love and urgent pursuit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">What is thy beloved</span>?--This question, introducing the description of the bridegroom's person, raises almost into certainty the conjecture that the poem was actually sung, or presented as an epithalamium, by alternate choirs (or single voices) of maidens and young men, as in the <span class= "ital">Carmen Nuptiale </span>of Catullus, vying the one in praise of the bridegroom, the other of the bride.
