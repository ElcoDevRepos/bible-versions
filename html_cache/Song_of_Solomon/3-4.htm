The "them" likely refers to the watchmen mentioned earlier in the chapter, symbolizing those who guard the city. In a spiritual sense, this can represent the soul's search for Christ, passing through worldly distractions or obstacles to find true love and fulfillment in Him.<p><b>when I found the one I love.</b><br>The "one I love" is a central theme in the Song of Solomon, representing the deep, intimate relationship between the bride and her beloved. Historically, this reflects the passionate love between Solomon and his bride. Spiritually, it is often interpreted as the soul's union with Christ, the ultimate beloved. This mirrors the joy and fulfillment found in a personal relationship with Jesus, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/john/15-9.htm">John 15:9-10</a>, where abiding in Christ's love is emphasized.<p><b>I held him and would not let go</b><br>This phrase indicates a strong desire to maintain closeness and intimacy. It reflects the commitment and tenacity in a loving relationship. In a spiritual context, it can symbolize the believer's determination to cling to Christ, as seen in <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12</a>, where Paul speaks of pressing on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of him. It underscores the importance of perseverance in faith.<p><b>until I had brought him to my mother&#8217;s house,</b><br>Bringing the beloved to the mother's house signifies a place of origin and security. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the mother's house was a place of familial blessing and approval. Spiritually, this can be seen as bringing Christ into the heart, the innermost being, where one's spiritual life is nurtured and grows. It also reflects the idea of introducing Christ into one's family and community, as seen in <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>, where the promise of salvation extends to one's household.<p><b>to the chamber of the one who conceived me.</b><br>The chamber represents a private, intimate space, often associated with birth and new beginnings. This can symbolize the believer's return to the foundational truths of faith, akin to being born again, as Jesus describes in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>. It highlights the renewal and transformation that occurs when one fully embraces a relationship with Christ. Historically, it also reflects the cultural importance of family lineage and heritage in ancient Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shulammite_woman.htm">The Shulammite Woman</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, often interpreted as the bride or beloved in the Song of Solomon.

It represents a return to foundational relationships and security.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chamber.htm">The Chamber</a></b><br>A private, intimate space, symbolizing deep personal connection and union, often interpreted as the inner sanctum of one's heart or spiritual life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_pursuit_of_love.htm">The Pursuit of Love</a></b><br>Just as the Shulammite actively seeks her beloved, believers are called to pursue a deep and personal relationship with Christ. This pursuit requires intentionality and perseverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_joy_of_finding.htm">The Joy of Finding</a></b><br>The joy and fulfillment found in Christ surpass all other pursuits. When we find Him, we experience a profound sense of peace and belonging.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holding_fast_to_christ.htm">Holding Fast to Christ</a></b><br>Like the Shulammite who holds onto her beloved, we are encouraged to cling to Christ, especially in times of uncertainty or trial. This involves a commitment to spiritual disciplines and community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/returning_to_foundations.htm">Returning to Foundations</a></b><br>Bringing the beloved to her mother&#8217;s house symbolizes returning to foundational truths and relationships. In our spiritual journey, we must often return to the basics of faith and the community that nurtures us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intimacy_with_god.htm">Intimacy with God</a></b><br>The chamber represents the intimate space we create for God in our hearts.

The lover was not far off, though he had delayed his coming. Possibly it is a real occurrence which is related. In that case we must suppose that the night was not very far advanced. But the hypothesis of a dream is the most natural explanation. The word <span class="accented">cherer</span>, which is used of the house, denotes the inner part, <span class="accented">penetralia.</span> The modesty of the last clause is very beautiful. The mother would, of course, at that time be in her sleeping chamber. There alone would the maiden receive her lover at such a time. The mother would gladly welcome the young man, and thus the love which Shulamith declares is set upon the ground of perfect chastity and homely purity. The object of this little episode introduced by the bride into her song as she lies in the arms of Solomon is to show that, ecstatic and intense as her devotion is, it is not the lawless affection of a concubine, but the love of a noble wife. The religious emotions are always presented to us in Scripture, not as wild fanaticism or superficial excitement, but as pure offering of the heart which blends with the highest relations and interests of human life, and sanctifies home and country with all their ties and obligations. The mother and the child are one in the new atmosphere of bridal joy. No religion is worthy of the name which does not bring its object into the chamber of her who conceived us. We love all that are bound with us in life not the less, but the more, because we love Christ supremely. We revere all that is just and holy in the common world the more, and not the less, because we worship God and serve the Lord. What a rebuke to asceticism, monasticism, and all unsocial religion! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/3-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I had just</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1496;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(kim&#183;&#8216;a&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
