The fierce rays of the Eastern sun are terrible to those who encounter them. The glory of the Church is a glory overwhelming as against all that opposes it. The description is pure hyperbole as applied to a fair bride, referring to the blazing beauty of her face and adornments, but symbolically it has always been felt a precious contribution to religious language. Perhaps no sentence in the Old Testament has been more frequently on the lips of devout men, especially when they have been speaking of the victories of the truth and the glowing prospects of the Saviour's kingdom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/6-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">who shines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;ni&#353;&#183;q&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
