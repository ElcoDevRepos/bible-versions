A seal over the heart suggests an intimate and personal commitment, while a seal upon the arm indicates a public declaration of belonging. This dual imagery reflects the depth and visibility of love. Biblically, seals are also associated with protection and covenant (e.g., <a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>, <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>). The heart and arm together symbolize both internal devotion and external action, paralleling the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5-8</a>, which calls for love of God with all one's heart, soul, and strength.<p><b>For love is as strong as death,</b><br>Death is often seen as the ultimate power, inevitable and inescapable. Comparing love to death emphasizes its overwhelming and binding nature. In the biblical context, love's strength is seen in God's covenantal love for His people, which is unwavering and eternal (<a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>). This phrase underscores the idea that true love is enduring and unyielding, much like the certainty of death.<p><b>its jealousy as unrelenting as Sheol.</b><br>Sheol, the Hebrew term for the realm of the dead, is depicted as insatiable and ever-consuming (<a href="/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>). Jealousy here is not petty envy but a zealous, protective love that tolerates no rivals, akin to God's jealousy for His people (<a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>). This reflects the exclusivity and intensity of genuine love, which demands total commitment and fidelity.<p><b>Its sparks are fiery flames, the fiercest blaze of all.</b><br>Fire is a common biblical metaphor for passion and purification (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>). The imagery of fiery flames suggests love's consuming and transformative power. The fiercest blaze indicates the intensity and purity of love, which can refine and purify like a refiner's fire. This can be seen as a type of Christ's love for the Church, which is passionate, purifying, and sacrificial (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shulammite_woman.htm">The Shulammite Woman</a></b><br>The primary female character in the Song of Solomon, often interpreted as a bride or beloved, representing the church or the soul in love with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author and male protagonist, representing the bridegroom or Christ in allegorical interpretations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/seal.htm">Seal</a></b><br>A symbol of ownership, authenticity, and protection, often used in ancient times to signify a binding agreement or covenant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/love_and_death.htm">Love and Death</a></b><br>Personified concepts in this verse, illustrating the powerful and unyielding nature of true love.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jealousy_and_the_grave.htm">Jealousy and the Grave</a></b><br>Metaphors for the intensity and permanence of love, suggesting that love's passion and commitment are as inevitable and consuming as death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_love.htm">The Power of Love</a></b><br>Love is depicted as a force as strong and inevitable as death, highlighting its profound impact on human relationships and spiritual life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenantal_commitment.htm">Covenantal Commitment</a></b><br>The imagery of a seal signifies a binding commitment, encouraging believers to view love as a covenant that requires faithfulness and dedication.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/jealousy_in_love.htm">Jealousy in Love</a></b><br>Jealousy, when understood as protective zeal, can be a positive force in love, ensuring the exclusivity and purity of the relationship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_passion.htm">Spiritual Passion</a></b><br>The fiery nature of love calls believers to cultivate a passionate and fervent relationship with God, mirroring the intensity of divine love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Just as love is as unyielding as the grave, believers are reminded of the eternal nature of God's love, which transcends earthly life and death.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Song_of_Solomon_8_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Song of Solomon 8:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Song_8_6_show_love_s_strength.htm">How does Song of Solomon 8:6 illustrate the strength of true love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_seal_over_heart_in_marriage.htm">What does "a seal over your heart" signify in a Christian marriage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_love_is_as_strong_as_death.htm">How can we apply "love is as strong as death" in our relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Song_8_6_1_Cor_13_4-7_on_love.htm">Connect Song of Solomon 8:6 with 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 on love's attributes.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_jealousy_guide_us_in_love.htm">How can "jealousy is as severe as Sheol" guide us in guarding love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_does_seal_over_heart_mean.htm">What does "a seal over your heart" symbolize in Song of Solomon 8:6?

Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it; if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, he would be utterly contemned.</span> Is this to be regarded as the reply of the bride to the tender allusion of her husband to their first love; or is it, as some think, only the first words which belong to the bride, while the rest of the two verses are a kind of chorus echoing her loving appeal, and bringing the general action of the poem to a conclusion? It is difficult to decide this, and the meaning is not affected either way. Perhaps, however, it is best to take it as spoken by the bride, who continues her address to the end of the eighth verse. She is full of joy in the return of perfect confidence; she prays that the full tide of affection may never cease to flow, that there be no ebbing of that happy feeling in which she now delights; and then sings the praise of love itself, as though a prelude of praise to a long and eternal peace. The seal is the signet ring, <span class="accented">chotham</span>, from a root "to impress" It was sometimes carried by a string on the breast, and would, therefore, be near the heart (see <a href="/genesis/38-18.htm">Genesis 38:18</a>). It was sometimes worn on the hand (see <a href="/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>; and cf. <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a>). It was not worn on the arm like a bracelet (<a href="/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a>). Probably it was not the signet ring which is referred to in the second clause: "Set me as a seal on thine heart, and as a bracelet on thine arm." The same simile is not infrequent in the prophets. The desire of Shulamith was to escape all possibility of those declensions of which she had spoken before. "Let me never be out of thy thoughts; let me never go back from my fulness of joy in thy love." The true believer understands well such language. He knows that the maintenance of devout affection is not a matter of mere desire and will. The Lord himself must help us with his blessed gifts, the influence of his gracious Spirit to overcome the feebleness and fickleness of a fallen heart. We want to be close to the heart of the Saviour; we want to be constantly in his eye, and so diligently employed in his service, so closely associated with the work of his mighty arm, that we shall be ever receiving from him the signs and evidences of his approval and affection. The purity and perfection of true love are the theme of every sincere believer. The priceless value of such love is described in the Book of Proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>), in <a href="/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18</a>, and <a href="/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>. It is an unquenchable flame - nothing can resist it. We cannot but recall the rapturous language of one who himself was an example of the highest devotedness to the Saviour, who rejoiced over death and the grave in the consciousness of victory through him from whose love nothing can separate us (<a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54</a>). Certainly the history of the sufferings and trials of the true Church form a most striking commentary upon these words. Floods of persecution have swept over it, but they have not quenched love. The flame has burst forth again and again when it seemed to be extinguished, and it has become a very "flame of the Lord." The bush has been burning, but has not been consumed. By jealousy is intended love in its intensity not bearing arival. The "flame of the Lord" may be compared with "the voice of the Lord," which is described in Hebrew poetry as connected with the fury of the storm. The flame, therefore, would be lightning and the voice thunder. The whole of this passage, which forms a kind of keynote of the poem, is more like a distinct strain introduced to give climax to the succession of songs than the natural expression of the bride's feelings. It has been always regarded as one of the sublimest apostrophes to love to be found anywhere. The enemies of God and of humanity are represented as falling before it, death and the grave. Its vehemence and force of manifestation are brought vividly before us by the comparison of the flash of lightning. It is remarkable that this exaltation of love should be included in the Old Testament, thus proving that the Mosaic Law, with its formal prescriptions, by no means fulfils the whole purpose of God in his revelation to the world. As the New Testament would not have been complete without the message of the beloved disciple, so this Old Testament must have its song of love. Nor is it only the ideal and the heavenly love which is celebrated, but human affection itself is placed very high, because it is associated with that which is Divine. It is a more precious thing than mere wealth or worldly honour, and he that trifles with it deserves the utmost scorn and contempt of his fellows. It is well to remark how consistently the poetic framework is maintained. There is no attempt to leave the lines of human relations even at this point, whets evidently the sentiment rises above them. The love which is apostrophized is not removed from earth in order to be seen apart from all earthly imperfections and impurities. We are invited rather to look through the human to the Divine which embraces it and glorifies it. That. is the method of the Divine revelation throughout. "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." We do not need to take Solomon's Song as an allegory. It is a song of human love, but as such it is a symbol of that which is Divine. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/8-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Set</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1461;&#1448;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#238;&#183;m&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular &#124;
