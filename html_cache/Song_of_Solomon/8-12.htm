In the context of the Song of Solomon, the vineyard is often seen as a metaphor for the beloved's body or her love. The speaker asserts her right to control and give her love freely, which reflects the biblical theme of free will and personal responsibility. The vineyard imagery is consistent with other biblical references, such as <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, where Israel is depicted as a vineyard. This metaphor underscores the importance of stewardship and the personal nature of love and commitment.<p><b>the thousand shekels are for you, O Solomon,</b><br>The mention of "thousand shekels" indicates a significant sum, suggesting the value and worth of the vineyard. Solomon, known for his wealth and wisdom, is addressed directly, which may symbolize the ultimate authority or the ideal king. This could also be seen as a reference to the bride's acknowledgment of Solomon's role or status. The number "thousand" often symbolizes completeness or abundance in biblical literature, indicating the fullness of the offering or dedication.<p><b>and two hundred are for those who tend its fruit.</b><br>This part of the verse acknowledges the labor and care provided by those who tend the vineyard. It reflects the biblical principle of fair compensation for work, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>, which states that a worker deserves his wages. The division of the shekels suggests a structured and just distribution of resources, highlighting the importance of community and shared responsibility. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, where the care and nurturing of the vineyard (or the Church) are rewarded and valued.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, often interpreted as the Shulammite woman, who is expressing her autonomy and stewardship over her own vineyard.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king to whom the Shulammite woman addresses part of her statement, representing authority and wealth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyard.htm">Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolic of personal life, purity, and the responsibilities one holds.

Earlier she spoke of neglecting her vineyard (Songs 1:6), yet now it is well-kept and fully hers to offer.<p>&#8226; This line celebrates God-given autonomy within purity: &#8220;The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-4.htm">1 Corinthians 7:4</a>). Their mutual yielding is voluntary, never coerced.<p>&#8226; It echoes <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>, guarding the heart until the right moment, and <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where a man and woman leave all else to become &#8220;one flesh.&#8221; The literal vineyard imagery pictures her safeguarding affection until covenant love releases it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the thousand shekels are for you, O Solomon</b><p>&#8226; A thousand shekels was a lavish kingly sum (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/25-6.htm">2 Chronicles 25:6</a>). She assigns the full, costly value of her vineyard to Solomon alone, underscoring exclusive devotion.<p>&#8226; The groom&#8217;s worth eclipses every lesser claim, much like the pearl of great price in <a href="/matthew/13-46.htm">Matthew 13:46</a>. In marriage, giving everything to one spouse reflects Christ&#8217;s self-giving love: &#8220;Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Literally, Solomon receives the entire &#8220;rent,&#8221; picturing how marital love is not fragmented among many but concentrated on one covenant partner (<a href="/proverbs/5-15.htm">Proverbs 5:15-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and two hundred are for those who tend its fruit</b><p>&#8226; While Solomon receives the thousand, the caretakers&#8212;brothers, friends, watchmen (Songs 1:6; 3:3)&#8212;are honored with a fair share. Good stewardship remembers those who helped nurture purity and character.<p>&#8226; This pattern aligns with <a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>, &#8220;The worker is worthy of his wages,&#8221; and <a href="/colossians/3-24.htm">Colossians 3:24</a>, which promises reward for faithful service. Even behind-the-scenes guardians of righteousness are not forgotten by God or by grateful believers.<p>&#8226; The distribution also hints at <a href="/luke/19-16.htm">Luke 19:16-17</a>&#8212;faithful servants are commended and compensated proportionately. Love values community support yet keeps ultimate allegiance to the beloved spouse.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The verse portrays a bride who now owns a well-tended vineyard&#8212;her person and affection&#8212;and freely bestows its full worth on Solomon, while still rewarding those who safeguarded her along the way. It teaches covenant exclusivity, voluntary self-giving, and gratitude toward supportive community, all underlining the sanctity and priceless value of God-ordained marital love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Thou, O Solomon </span>. . .<span class= "ital">--i.e., </span>"Let Solomon keep and enjoy his possessions (his harem of mercenary beauties), which cost so much to obtain and keep; I am happier in the secure love of my one true wife."
