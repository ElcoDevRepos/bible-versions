In the context of the Song of Solomon, it reflects the intimate relationship between the Shulammite woman and her beloved, often interpreted as King Solomon. This relationship can be seen as a representation of the love between Christ and the Church, drawing parallels to <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>, where Christ's love for the Church is described as sacrificial and pure.<p><b>a sachet of myrrh</b><br>Myrrh is a fragrant resin used in ancient times for perfume, anointing oil, and embalming. It was a valuable commodity, symbolizing wealth and luxury. In biblical times, myrrh was also one of the gifts brought by the Magi to Jesus (<a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>), symbolizing His future suffering and death. The use of myrrh here suggests something precious and cherished, indicating the beloved's value and significance to the speaker.<p><b>resting between my breasts</b><br>This imagery conveys intimacy and closeness, suggesting a deep personal bond. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, such expressions of affection were common in romantic poetry. The placement of the sachet of myrrh "between my breasts" indicates a cherished and constant presence, akin to the indwelling of Christ in the believer's heart, as seen in <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, where Paul speaks of Christ living in him. This phrase also highlights the personal and internalized nature of the relationship, emphasizing the beloved's continual presence and influence in the speaker's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>In the Song of Solomon, the "beloved" often refers to the male lover, traditionally understood as Solomon or a representation of an idealized lover. In a spiritual allegory, it can also represent Christ as the bridegroom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shulammite.htm">The Shulammite</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse is the Shulammite woman, who expresses her deep affection and longing for her beloved.
