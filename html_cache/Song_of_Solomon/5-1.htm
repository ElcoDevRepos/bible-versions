The garden represents a place of beauty, growth, and intimacy, often used in Scripture to depict a place of divine encounter (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>, <a href="/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12-16</a>). The terms "my sister, my bride" indicate a deep, multifaceted relationship, combining familial love with marital intimacy. In ancient Near Eastern culture, such language underscores the purity and closeness of the bond.<p><b>I have gathered my myrrh with my spice.</b><br>Myrrh and spices were valuable commodities in biblical times, often used in anointing oils and perfumes (<a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23-25</a>). Myrrh, in particular, is associated with both love and suffering, as it was a gift brought to Jesus at His birth (<a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>) and used in His burial (<a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>). This gathering signifies the bridegroom's delight in the richness and fragrance of the relationship, as well as a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrificial love.<p><b>I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;</b><br>Honeycomb and honey symbolize sweetness and abundance. In biblical literature, honey is often associated with the Promised Land, described as "a land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). This imagery conveys the satisfaction and delight found in the union between the bridegroom and the bride, paralleling the spiritual nourishment and joy found in communion with Christ.<p><b>I have drunk my wine with my milk.</b><br>Wine and milk together suggest a combination of celebration and nourishment. Wine is frequently a symbol of joy and festivity in Scripture (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>), while milk represents sustenance and growth (<a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>). This phrase highlights the completeness and richness of the relationship, akin to the spiritual fulfillment found in Christ, who offers both joy and sustenance to His followers.<p><b>Eat, O friends, and drink; drink freely, O beloved.</b><br>The invitation to friends to eat and drink reflects the communal aspect of love and celebration. In the context of a wedding feast, it signifies the sharing of joy with others, reminiscent of the communal nature of the Church. The exhortation to "drink freely" suggests abundance and generosity, echoing the invitation of Christ to partake in the blessings of His kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>, <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>). The term "beloved" underscores the deep affection and chosen status of those invited, paralleling the Church as the beloved of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bridegroom.htm">The Bridegroom</a></b><br>Often interpreted as Solomon or a representation of Christ, the bridegroom speaks of intimate union and satisfaction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>Symbolic of the church or the individual believer, she is addressed with terms of endearment and intimacy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_garden.htm">The Garden</a></b><br>Represents a place of intimacy and personal relationship, often seen as the heart or life of the believer.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/friends.htm">Friends</a></b><br>Those invited to share in the joy and celebration, possibly representing the community of believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast.htm">The Feast</a></b><br>Symbolizes the abundance and satisfaction found in a relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/intimacy_with_god.htm">Intimacy with God</a></b><br>The passage invites believers to cultivate a deep, personal relationship with God, akin to the intimate bond between bride and bridegroom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_abundance.htm">Spiritual Abundance</a></b><br>Just as the bridegroom enjoys the fruits of the garden, believers are encouraged to experience the fullness of life in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_celebration.htm">Community Celebration</a></b><br>The invitation to friends to partake in the feast highlights the importance of communal joy and fellowship in the Christian life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_garden.htm">Symbolism of the Garden</a></b><br>Reflect on the state of your "garden"&#8212;your heart and spiritual life&#8212;and how it can be a place of meeting with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/invitation_to_participate.htm">Invitation to Participate</a></b><br>The call to "eat and drink freely" is an invitation to actively engage in the blessings and joy of a life with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Song_of_Solomon_5_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Song of Solomon 5:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Song_of_Solomon_5_1_God_s_marital_blessing.htm">How does Song of Solomon 5:1 illustrate God's blessing on marital intimacy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Divine_presence_in_I_have_come.htm">What does "I have come into my garden" signify about divine presence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Song_5_1_show_Christ_s_love.htm">How can Song of Solomon 5:1 enhance understanding of Christ's love for the Church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_eat_drink_in_fellowship.htm">How can believers apply "eat, O friends, and drink" in Christian fellowship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Links_between_Song_5_1_Gen_2_24.htm">What scriptural connections exist between Song of Solomon 5:1 and Genesis 2:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Imagery_s_role_in_Song_5_1_for_marriage.htm">What is the significance of the imagery in Song of Solomon 5:1 for Christian marriage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/God_s_view_on_love_in_Song_5_1.htm">How does Song of Solomon 5:1 reflect God's view on love and intimacy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_include_Song_5_1_despite_sensuality.htm">Why is Song of Solomon 5:1 included in the Bible despite its sensual language?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_song_of_solomon_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Song of Solomon 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_focus_on_sensuality_in_song_4_5-7.htm">Why does this chapter focus on sensual imagery (Song of Solomon 4:5&#8211;7) when other biblical texts seem to emphasize modesty or spiritual themes?

The poet, it has been already said (Note, <a href="/songs/2-7.htm" title="I charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that you stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.">Song of Solomon 2:7</a>), loves to invoke the sympathy of others with his joys, and the following lines of Shelley reproduce the very feeling of this passage. Here, as throughout the poem, it is the "new strong wine of love," and not the fruit of the grape, which is desired and drunk.<p>"Thou art the wine, whose drunkenness is all<p>We can desire, O Love! and happy souls,<p>Ere from thy vine the leaves of autumn fall,<p>Catch thee and feed, from thine o'erflowing bowls,<p>Thousands who thirst for thy ambrosial dew."<p><span class= "ital">Prince Athanase.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.</span> <span class="accented">My myrrh with my balsam</span> (see <a href="/1_kings/10-10.htm">1 Kings 10:10</a>). There were celebrated plantations at Jericho. The Queen of Sheba brought "of spices very great store;" "There came no more such abundance of spices as these which the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon." Is there a reference to the conversion of the heathen nations in this? The wine and milk are what God offers to his people (see <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>) without money and without price. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f30;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> is what Chloe gives to Daphnis (cf. <a href="/psalms/19-6.htm">Psalm 19:6</a>). It would seem as though the writer intended us to follow the bridal procession to its destination in the royal palace. The bridal night intervenes. The joy of the king in his bride is complete. The climax is reached, and the rest of the song is an amplification. The call to the friends is to celebrate the marriage in a banquet on the second day (see <a href="/genesis/29-28.htm">Genesis 29:28</a>; <a href="/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12</a>; Tobit 11:18; and cf. <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a> and Revelation 19:9). A parallel might be found in <a href="/psalms/22-26.htm">Psalm 22:26</a>, where Messiah, at the close of his sufferings, salutes his friends, the poor, and as they eat at his table gives them his royal blessing, "Vivat cor vestrum in aeternum!" The perfect state of the Church is represented in Scripture, both in the Old Testament and in the New, as celebrated with universal joy - all tears wiped away from off all faces, and the loud harpings of innumerable harpers. Can we doubt that this wonderful book has tinged the whole of subsequent inspired Scripture? Can we read the descriptions of triumphant rejoicing in the Apocalypse and not believe that the apostolic seer was familiar with this idealized love song? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/5-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I have come</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to my garden,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7713;an&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
