Solomon, known for his wisdom and prosperity, often undertook grand projects, including the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 6). The carriage, or palanquin, symbolizes royal splendor and authority. In a broader biblical context, Solomon's works often prefigure the majesty and wisdom of Christ, who is referred to as the greater Solomon (<a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>). The carriage can also be seen as a type of the church, which Christ, the true King, builds and adorns with His grace.<p><b>out of the timber of Lebanon.</b><br>Lebanon was renowned for its high-quality cedar trees, which were used in the construction of significant structures, including Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>). The use of Lebanon's timber signifies strength, durability, and beauty. In biblical symbolism, cedar wood often represents incorruptibility and eternal life, pointing to the enduring nature of Christ's kingdom. The choice of materials reflects the excellence and care in the creation of something meant to last, much like the eternal covenant established through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.

Its derivation has been sought in Hebrew, Persian, Greek, and Sanskrit. The LXX. render <span class= "greekheb">???????</span>; Vulg., <span class= "ital">ferculum; </span>and it seems natural, with Gesenius, to trace the three words to the root common in <span class= "ital">parah, </span><span class= "greekheb">????</span><span class= "ital">, </span>fero, fahren, bear, and possibly the sign of such a common origin in the Sanskrit <span class= "ital">pargana = a saddle </span>(Hitzig). At all events, <span class= "ital">appiryon </span>must be a <span class= "ital">palanquin, </span>or <span class= "ital">litter, </span>both from the context, which describes the approach of a royal cortege, and from the description given of it, where the word translated <span class= "ital">covering </span>suggests the notion of a movable litter, rather than of a State bed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">King Solomon made himself a palanquin of the wood of Lebanon. He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the seats of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, from the daughters of Jerusalem.</span> The palanquin is described, that the attention may be kept fixed awhile on the bridal procession, which, of course, forms the kernel of the whole poem, as representing the perfect union of the bride and bridegroom. The Greek versions translate <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ferculum.</span> We read in Athenaeus (5:13) that the philosopher and tyrant Athemon showed himself on "a silver-legged <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> with purple coverlet." There probably is some connection between the Hebrew <span class="accented">appiryon</span> and the Greek <span class="accented">phoreion</span>, but it is exceedingly doubtful if the Hebrew is merely a lengthened form of the Greek. Delitzsch derives the Hebrew from a root <span class="accented">parah</span>, "to cut or carve" anything of wood. The Greek would seem to be connected with the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>, "to bear," "carry." The resemblance may be a mere coincidence. The rabbinical tradition is that the Hebrew word means "couch, or litter." Hitzig connects it with the Sanscrit <span class="accented">paryana</span>, meaning "saddle," "riding saddle," with which we may compare the Indian <span class="accented">paryang.</span> "bed." Others find a Chaldee root for the word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, "to run," as <span class="accented">currus</span> in Latin, or from a root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, "to shine," <span class="accented">i.e."</span> to be adorned." At all events, it would not be safe to argue the late date of the book from such a word as <span class="accented">appiryon</span>, on account of its resemblance to a Greek word. The "wood of Lebanon" is, of course, the cedar or cypress (<a href="/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a>, etc.). There may be a covert allusion intended to the decoration of the temple as the place where the honour of the Lord dwelleth, and where he meets his people. The frame of the palanquin was of wood, the ornaments of silver. The references to the high value set upon silver, while gold is spoken of as though it was abundant, are indications of the age in which the poem was composed, which must have been nearly contemporaneous with the Homeric poems, in which gold is spoken of similarly. Recent discoveries of the tomb of Agamemnon, etc., confirm the literary argument. The palanquins of India are also highly decorated. The daughters of Jerusalem, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the ladies of the court, in their affection for King Solomon, have procured a costly tapestry, or several such, which they have spread over the purple cushion. Thus it is paved, or covered over, with the tokens of love - while all love is but a preparation for this supreme love. (For the purple coverings of the seat, see <a href="/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a>; <a href="/amos/3-12.htm">Amos 3:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-16.htm">Proverbs 7:16</a>.) The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> in the last clause is rendered differently by some, but there can be no doubt that the meaning is "on the part of," that is, coming from. The typical interpreter certainly finds a firm ground here. Whether we think of the individual believer or of the Church of God, the metaphor is very apt and beautiful - we are borne along towards the perfection of our peace and blessedness in a chariot of love. All that surrounds us speaks to us of the Saviour's love and of his royal magnificence, as he is adored by all the pure and lovely spirits in whose companionship he delights. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/3-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
