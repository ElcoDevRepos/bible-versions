The act of putting his hand to the latch signifies a desire for closeness and entry, symbolizing the beloved's initiative in seeking a deeper relationship. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, doors and latches were significant in maintaining privacy and security, and the beloved's action indicates trust and affection. This imagery can also be seen as a metaphor for Christ's pursuit of the church, where He stands at the door and knocks, as seen in <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>. The beloved's action is a gentle invitation, reflecting the patience and persistence of divine love.<p><b>my heart pounded for him.</b><br>The response of the Shulammite woman, with her heart pounding, illustrates a deep emotional and physical reaction to her beloved's presence. This phrase captures the intensity of love and longing, emphasizing the personal and passionate nature of their relationship. In a broader spiritual sense, this can be seen as the soul's response to the presence of God, echoing the longing and desire for communion with the divine. The heart's reaction is a common biblical motif, often associated with love, fear, or anticipation, as seen in <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>, where the psalmist's soul longs for God. This emotional response underscores the theme of mutual desire and the transformative power of love, both human and divine.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>In the Song of Solomon, the beloved is often interpreted as Solomon or a representation of Christ in allegorical readings.

The hole is the aperture made in the door above the lock for the insertion of the hand with the key. The ancient lock was probably like the one in use in Palestine now. It consists of a <span class= "ital">hollow </span>bolt or bar, which passes through a staple fixed to the door and into the door-post. In the staple are a number of movable pins, which drop into corresponding holes in the bolt when it is pushed home, and the door is then locked. To unlock it, the key is slid into the hollow bolt, and the movable pins pushed back by other pins in it, corresponding in size and form, which fill up the holes, and so enable the bolt to be withdrawn. It is said that, in lieu of a proper key, the arm can be inserted into the hollow bolt and the pins be pushed up by the hand, if provided with some soft material, as lard or wax, to fill up the holes, and keep the pins from falling back again till the bolt is withdrawn. This offers one explanation of <a href="/songs/5-5.htm" title="I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, on the handles of the lock.">Song of Solomon 5:5</a>. Coming to the door and having no key, the lover is supposed to make use of some myrrh, brought as a present, in trying to open the door, and, not succeeding, to go away. The <span class= "ital">sweet smelling </span>(Marg., <span class= "ital">passing, </span>or <span class= "ital">running about</span>) is the myrrh that drops from the tree naturally, before any incision is made in the bark, and is considered specially fine. Others explain <a href="/songs/5-5.htm" title="I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, on the handles of the lock.">Song of Solomon 5:5</a> by comparison with the heathen custom alluded to in Lucretius iv. 1173:--<p>"At lacrimans exclusus amator limina saepe<p>Floribus et sertis operit posteisque superbos<p>Unguet amaricino, et foribus miser oscula figit."<p>(Comp. Tibullus, 1:2-14.) Perhaps <a href="/proverbs/7-17.htm" title="I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.">Proverbs 7:17</a> makes the comparison allowable, but the first explanation is preferable. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my heart was moved for him.</span> The door hole is a part of the door pierced through at the upper part of the lock, or door bolt (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>), that is, by the opening from without to within, or through the opening, as if, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to open the door by pressing back the lock or bolt from within. There was some obstacle. He tailed to open it. It had not been left so that he could easily obtain admittance. The metaphor is very apt and beautiful. How much he loved her! How he tried to come to her! As applied to the Saviour, what infinite suggestiveness! He would be with us, and not only knocks at the door, but is impatient to enter; tries the lock, and too often finds it in vain; he is repelled, he is resisted, he is coldly excluded. <span class="accented">My heart was moved for him.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, "my inner being" (cf. <a href="/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>, where the same word is used of God).
