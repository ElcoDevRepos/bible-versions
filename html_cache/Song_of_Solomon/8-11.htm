Baal-hamon is a location not specifically identified in other biblical texts, but its name suggests a place of great wealth or multitude, as "Baal" can mean "lord" or "owner," and "hamon" means "multitude" or "abundance." This vineyard symbolizes Solomon's extensive wealth and influence, reflecting his reign's prosperity (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20-25</a>). The vineyard can also be seen as a metaphor for the beloved in the Song of Solomon, representing beauty and fertility.<p><b>He leased it to the tenants.</b><br>The leasing of the vineyard to tenants indicates a system of stewardship and responsibility. In ancient Israel, landowners often leased their land to tenants who would cultivate it and share the produce. This reflects the economic practices of the time, where land was a primary source of wealth and sustenance. The tenants' role can be seen as a parallel to the stewardship God expects from His people, as seen in the parable of the tenants in <a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-41</a>, where the vineyard represents God's kingdom.<p><b>For its fruit, each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver.</b><br>The requirement for each tenant to bring a thousand shekels of silver for the vineyard's fruit underscores the value and productivity of the vineyard. A shekel was a standard unit of weight and currency in ancient Israel, and a thousand shekels would represent a significant sum, indicating the vineyard's high yield and worth. This can be seen as a reflection of the covenant relationship between God and His people, where God provides abundantly, and in return, He expects faithfulness and dedication. The number "thousand" often symbolizes completeness or abundance in biblical numerology, further emphasizing the vineyard's prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wisdom and wealth.

The verse opens by reminding us that the king himself owns the vineyard, underscoring rightful ownership and authority (see <a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Baal-hamon&#8221; suggests a place of abundance&#8212;echoing earlier vineyard imagery in Songs 1:6, where the bride speaks of neglecting her own vineyard.<p>&#8226; Vineyards in Scripture picture covenant people (<a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>) and, by extension, the lives God entrusts to us (<a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail teaches that all blessing&#8212;physical or relational&#8212;originates with God-given ownership and is meant to flourish under His rule (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He leased it to the tenants</b><p>&#8226; Solomon entrusts day-to-day care to others, highlighting responsibility and accountability (compare <a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-41</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The tenants receive both privilege and trust: they work in a rich, already-established vineyard rather than starting from nothing (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; This reminds believers that every gift&#8212;marriage, ministry, resources&#8212;comes with stewardship expectations (<a href="/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42-48</a>).<p>&#8226; The leasing arrangement implies ongoing relationship: the king remains owner, the tenants remain answerable (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For its fruit, each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver</b><p>&#8226; A thousand shekels signal weighty worth (about 25 lbs. of silver, cf. <a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14</a>) and underscore the high value Solomon places on the vineyard&#8217;s yield.<p>&#8226; Fruitfulness is non-negotiable: the vineyard must produce, reflecting God&#8217;s call that our lives &#8220;bear much fruit&#8221; to His glory (<a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-11.htm">Philippians 1:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The large payment sets up verse 12, where the bride dedicates the profit back to Solomon, symbolizing wholehearted devotion.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, such fruit represents love and loyalty that cannot be bought cheaply (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The required return reminds believers that grace is free, yet God still expects a response of costly obedience (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1-2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Song 8:11 paints a vivid picture: the king owns an abundant vineyard, entrusts it to caretakers, and rightly expects rich fruit in return. In marriage and in our walk with Christ, we are stewards of what belongs to the King. He supplies the vineyard, assigns the work, and values the harvest. Our privilege&#8212;and joyful duty&#8212;is to cultivate what He gives, then offer the full, precious yield back to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11, 12) <span class= "bld">Solomon had a vineyard . . .</span>--Here the poet repeats the sentiment of <a href="/context/songs/6-8.htm" title="There are three score queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.">Song of Solomon 6:8-9</a>--the contrast of his love for one chosen bride with the state of feeling and morality fostered by polygamy.
