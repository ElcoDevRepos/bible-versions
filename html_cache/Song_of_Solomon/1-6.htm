In ancient Near Eastern culture, a darker complexion often indicated outdoor labor, which was associated with lower social status. This phrase highlights the societal norms and prejudices of the time, where fair skin was often idealized. Theologically, this can be seen as a reminder that God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>.<p><b>for the sun has gazed upon me</b><br>The reference to the sun suggests exposure to the elements, indicating a life of hard work. This aligns with the agrarian society of ancient Israel, where many people worked outdoors. The sun's gaze symbolizes the unavoidable circumstances that have shaped her appearance, much like how life's trials can shape a person's character. This can be connected to the refining process described in <a href="/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>, where trials purify and strengthen faith.<p><b>My mother&#8217;s sons were angry with me</b><br>This phrase suggests familial conflict, possibly indicating a blended family or step-siblings, which was not uncommon in biblical times. The anger of her brothers may reflect jealousy or a desire to control, reminiscent of Joseph's brothers in <a href="/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a>. This familial tension can be seen as a type of the rejection Christ faced from His own people, as noted in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>.<p><b>they made me a keeper of the vineyards</b><br>The vineyards symbolize responsibility and labor imposed upon her by her brothers. Vineyards were significant in Israelite culture, representing both economic livelihood and spiritual fruitfulness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>. This imposition of labor can be seen as a metaphor for the burdens others place upon us, contrasting with Jesus' invitation in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a> to find rest in Him.<p><b>but my own vineyard I have neglected</b><br>The neglect of her own vineyard symbolizes the personal sacrifices she has made due to external demands. This can be interpreted as a loss of personal identity or spiritual neglect, a theme echoed in the parable of the ten virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>, where preparedness and personal spiritual care are emphasized. Theologically, it serves as a call to prioritize one's relationship with God amidst life's demands, reflecting the greatest commandment to love God with all one's heart, soul, and mind (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shulammite_woman.htm">The Shulammite Woman</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing her feelings of being judged for her appearance and her circumstances.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sun.htm">The Sun</a></b><br>Represents the natural elements that have affected the Shulammite's appearance, symbolizing external pressures and life circumstances.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mother's_sons.htm">Mother&#8217;s Sons</a></b><br>Likely refers to the Shulammite's brothers or close male relatives who have authority over her, contributing to her burdens.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyards.htm">Vineyards</a></b><br>Symbolic of responsibilities and duties imposed on the Shulammite, representing work and obligations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/her_own_vineyard.htm">Her Own Vineyard</a></b><br>Metaphor for her personal life, spiritual well-being, or self-care, which she has neglected due to external demands.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_based_on_appearance.htm">Judgment Based on Appearance</a></b><br>We should be cautious not to judge others based on their outward appearance or circumstances.

The inspired warning encourages believers to value inner character, echoing <a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the sun has gazed upon me</b><p>- Her darker skin tone is the natural result of long hours under the blazing sun. This reinforces the goodness of honest labor and the dignity of every skin shade (<a href="/ruth/2-7.htm">Ruth 2:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-23.htm">Proverbs 14:23</a>).<p>- The wording also suggests a testing heat.

This task imagery links to the stewardship Adam and Eve received in Eden (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>).<p>- Work assigned by others can feel thankless, yet God sees and rewards every hidden act of diligence (<a href="/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But my own vineyard I have neglected</b><p>- &#8220;My own vineyard&#8221; points first to her personal appearance&#8212;she has had no time for self-care&#8212;yet the phrase also hints at the heart, the inner life (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>).<p>- The contrast warns believers not to let external duties crowd out the cultivation of their relationship with the Lord (Songs 8:12; <a href="/luke/10-40.htm">Luke 10:40-42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Verse 6 paints a faithful young woman weathered by the sun, misused by brothers, and stretched thin by relentless responsibility.

The "all-seeing sun" is a commonplace of poetry; but here with sense of scorching. The heroine goes on to explain the cause of her exposure to the sun. Her dark complexion is accidental, and cannot therefore be used as an argument that she was an Egyptian princess, whose nuptials with Solomon are celebrated in the poem.<p><span class= "bld">Mother's children</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, <span class= "ital">brothers, </span>not necessarily <span class= "ital">step-brothers, </span>as Ewald and others. (Comp. <a href="/psalms/50-20.htm" title="You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son.">Psalm 50:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-8.htm" title="I am become a stranger to my brothers, and an alien to my mother's children.">Psalm 69:8</a>.) The reference to the mother rather than the father is natural in a country where polygamy was practised. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Look not upon me, because I am swarthy, because the sun hath scorched me. My mother's sons were incensed against me; they made me keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.</span> The meaning seems to be - Do not let the swarthiness of my complexion lower me in your eyes. Literally the words are, <span class="accented">Do not see me that I am</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do not regard me as being, because I am. There is no necessity to suppose any looks of the ladies to have suggested the words. They are the words of modest self-depreciation mingled with joyful sense of acceptance. It is difficult to render the Hebrew exactly. The word translated "swarthy" (<span class="accented">shecharchoreh</span>) is probably a diminutive from <span class="accented">shechorah</span>, which itself means "blackish;" so that the meaning is, "that my complexion is dark." The reference to the sun explains the word still further, as pointing, not to a difference of race, but to mere temporary effects of an outdoor life: "The sun has been playing with my complexion;" or, as the LXX. renders it, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "The sun has been gazing at me." So other Greek versions. Some, however, include the idea of burning or scorching, which is the literal meaning of the verb, though in <a href="/job/3-9.htm">Job 3:9</a> and Job 41:10 it is used in the sense of looking at or upon. The sun is the eye of the heavens (see <a href="/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11</a>), and with delicate feeling it is spoken of here as feminine, the bride playfully alluding, perhaps, to the lady seen in the heavens preceding the ladies of the court in gazing on her beauty. It is difficult to explain with perfect satisfaction the next clause of the verse. Doubtless "mother's sons" is a poetical periphrasis for brothers - <span class="accented">not</span> "step-brothers," as some have said. Perhaps the mother was a widow, as no father is mentioned. The best explanation is that the bride is simply giving an account of herself, why she is so browned in the sun. The brothers, for some reason, had been incensed against her, possibly on account of her favour in the eyes of the king, but more probably for private, family reasons. They would not have her shutting herself up in the house to take care of her complexion; they would have her in the vineyards. In the word "keeper" (<span class="accented">noterah</span> instead of <span class="accented">notzerah</span>) we have an instance of the northern dialect - a kind of Platt-Hebrew - hardening the pronunciation. <span class="accented">My own vineyard have I not kept</span> no doubt refers simply and solely to her complexion, not to her virginity or character. She means - I was compelled by my brothers to go into the vineyards in the heat of the sun, and the consequence was, as you see, I have not been able to preserve the delicacy of my skin; I have been careless of my personal beauty. The sun has done its work. The reference helps us to recognize the historical background of the poem, and leads naturally to the use of the pastoral language which runs through the whole. The king is a shepherd, and his bride a shepherdess. Without straining the spiritual interpretation, we may yet discover in this beautiful candour and Simplicity of the bride the reflection of the soul's virtues in its joyful realization of Divine favour; but the true method of interpretation requires no minute, detailed adjustment of the language to spiritual facts, but rather seeks the meaning in the total impression of the poem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/1-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">stare</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1433;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(tir&#183;&#8217;&#363;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural &#124;
