It is often associated with fertility and abundance, symbolizing the bride's beauty and grace. In biblical history, Mount Carmel is the site of Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18), representing a place of divine victory and revelation. The comparison of the bride's head to Mount Carmel suggests a regal and majestic appearance, emphasizing her dignity and honor. This imagery reflects the high esteem in which the bride is held, akin to the prominence of Mount Carmel in the landscape of Israel.<p><b>the hair of your head like purple threads</b><br>Purple is a color traditionally associated with royalty, wealth, and nobility in ancient cultures, including Israel. The mention of purple threads in the bride's hair signifies her royal status and the richness of her beauty. In the ancient world, purple dye was rare and expensive, often reserved for kings and the elite. This imagery highlights the bride's elevated status and the preciousness of her appearance. The use of purple also connects to the royal imagery found throughout the Song of Solomon, where the bride and groom are often depicted in kingly and queenly terms, symbolizing the divine love and covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>the king is captured in your tresses</b><br>The phrase suggests the king's deep admiration and captivation by the bride's beauty. In the context of the Song of Solomon, the king represents Solomon, but also serves as a type of Christ, the ultimate Bridegroom. The imagery of being "captured" indicates a voluntary and joyful surrender to love, reflecting the mutual affection and desire between the bride and groom. This can be seen as a metaphor for the relationship between Christ and the Church, where Christ is drawn to the beauty and devotion of His people. The tresses, or locks of hair, symbolize intimacy and personal connection, emphasizing the closeness and affection in the relationship. This imagery resonates with the theme of divine love and the transformative power of being loved by the King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The woman being described in this verse, often interpreted as the Shulammite woman, who is the object of affection in the Song of Solomon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_carmel.htm">Mount Carmel</a></b><br>A mountain range in Israel known for its beauty and lush vegetation, symbolizing majesty and splendor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Often interpreted as Solomon, representing the lover or husband in the poetic dialogue.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/royal_tapestry.htm">Royal Tapestry</a></b><br>A metaphor for the woman's hair, indicating beauty, richness, and intricacy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/captivation.htm">Captivation</a></b><br>The emotional response of the king, symbolizing deep admiration and love.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_beauty_of_creation.htm">The Beauty of Creation</a></b><br>Just as Mount Carmel is a testament to God's creative power, so is the beauty of a person.

It is a promontory. The meaning, no doubt, is the exquisite fitness of the head upon the neck, which is one of the most lovely traits of personal beauty. Some, however, think that the reference is to colour - Carmel being derived from the Persian, and meaning "crimson." This is rejected by Delitzsch, as the Persian would be <span class="accented">carmile</span>, not <span class="accented">carmel</span>. The transition is natural from the position and shape of the head and neck to the hair. The purple shellfish is found near Carmel (cf. Lucian's <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and Anacreon's <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and similar expressions in Virgil's 'Georgics,' 1:405, and Tibullus, 1:4, 63). The locks of hair are a glistening purple colour, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their black is purple as they catch the lights. Hengstenberg, however, thinks that the reference is to the temples, and not to the hair itself; but the use of the term in classical poets is decisive. The lovely head shaking the locks as the body moves gracefully in the dance fills the king with delight and admiration. He is quite captivated, and the ladies, having finished their description of the bride, look at the bridegroom, and behold him quite lost in the fascination - "held captive in the tresses." Delitzsch quotes a similar expression from Goethe, in the 'West Ostliche Divan,' "There are more than fifty hooks in each lock of thy hair." The idea of taking captive is frequent in Hebrew poetry (cf. <a href="/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a>; Sirach 9:3, 4). Thus ends the song of the ladies in praise of the bride. We must suppose that the king, who is probably present, then takes up the word, and pours out his heart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/7-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Your head</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1444;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#333;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
