Wine was a staple in ancient Israel, often associated with abundance and blessing (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). The comparison of the beloved's mouth to fine wine suggests sweetness, pleasure, and delight. In the context of the Song of Solomon, which celebrates marital love, this imagery underscores the deep affection and attraction between the lovers. The reference to "finest wine" also implies a sense of refinement and quality, indicating the beloved's words and kisses are cherished and savored. This can be seen as a metaphor for the richness and depth of love, paralleling the spiritual joy found in a relationship with God (<a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>, where Jesus turns water into wine, symbolizing the new covenant).<p><b>May it flow smoothly to my beloved,</b><br>The desire for the wine to flow smoothly reflects a longing for ease and harmony in the relationship. In ancient Near Eastern culture, smooth wine was a sign of good quality, free from impurities. This imagery can be seen as a metaphor for the purity and sincerity of love. The smooth flow suggests a seamless connection and communication between the lovers, emphasizing unity and mutual satisfaction. This can also be related to the peace and fulfillment found in a relationship with Christ, who is often depicted as the bridegroom of the Church (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<p><b>gliding gently over lips and teeth.</b><br>The gentle gliding over lips and teeth highlights the tenderness and intimacy of the lovers' interaction. In the poetic language of the Song of Solomon, physical expressions of love are celebrated as part of God's design for marriage. The mention of lips and teeth suggests a close, personal connection, emphasizing the importance of both verbal and non-verbal communication in a loving relationship. This can be seen as a reflection of the gentle and nurturing nature of Christ's love for His people, as He speaks words of life and truth (<a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>). The imagery of gliding also conveys a sense of grace and elegance, qualities that are often associated with divine love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lover.htm">The Lover</a></b><br>Often interpreted as Solomon, the lover in the Song of Solomon represents the bridegroom, expressing deep affection and admiration for his beloved.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The Shulammite woman, representing the bride, is the object of the lover's affection and admiration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_setting.htm">The Setting</a></b><br>The Song of Solomon is set in a pastoral and royal context, often using imagery from nature and the royal court to describe the love between the lover and the beloved.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wine.htm">The Wine</a></b><br>Symbolizes joy, celebration, and the richness of love, often used in biblical literature to denote abundance and blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_imagery_of_lips_and_teeth.htm">The Imagery of Lips and Teeth</a></b><br>Represents communication, intimacy, and the sweetness of words exchanged between lovers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Just as the beloved's mouth is compared to the best wine, our words should be edifying, bringing joy and encouragement to others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intimacy_in_relationships.htm">Intimacy in Relationships</a></b><br>The passage highlights the importance of intimacy and communication in relationships, encouraging us to cultivate deep and meaningful connections.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_wine.htm">Symbolism of Wine</a></b><br>Wine as a symbol of joy and abundance reminds us of the blessings found in godly relationships and the joy of the Lord.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_and_the_church.htm">Christ and the Church</a></b><br>The love between the lover and the beloved can be seen as a reflection of Christ's love for the Church, calling us to a deeper understanding of divine love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_beauty_of_creation.htm">The Beauty of Creation</a></b><br>The use of natural imagery in the Song of Solomon invites us to appreciate the beauty of God's creation and its reflection of His love.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Song_of_Solomon_7_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Song of Solomon 7:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Song_7_9_show_marital_beauty.htm">How does Song of Solomon 7:9 illustrate the beauty of marital intimacy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Insights_on_communication_in_Song_7_9.htm">What can we learn about communication from Song of Solomon 7:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Song_Sol_7_9_Eph_5_25-33_on_marriage.htm">How does Song of Solomon 7:9 connect with Ephesians 5:25-33 on marriage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Inspire_deeper_love_via_Song_7_9.htm">How can Song of Solomon 7:9 inspire deeper love in your marriage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_appreciation_in_relationships.htm">What role does appreciation play in relationships, as seen in Song of Solomon 7:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Song_of_Solomon_7_9_on_biblical_love.htm">How does Song of Solomon 7:9 reflect the nature of love in a biblical context?

The lovers are speaking face-to-face, celebrating physical beauty and marital delight (Songs 1:2-4; 4:1-15). This immediate, literal context grounds the verse in the celebration of covenant love&#8212;nothing crude, yet unabashedly joyful, just as <a href="/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a> describes the first marriage &#8220;naked and unashamed.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>imagery of wine in scripture</b><p>&#8226; Wine often pictures joy and blessing (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; It is linked with covenant celebration, such as the Passover cup (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14, 21</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Here, &#8220;the finest wine&#8221; suggests exquisite pleasure, purity, and life-giving refreshment, mirroring the bridegroom&#8217;s experience of his bride&#8217;s loving words and kisses (Songs 4:10-11).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;your mouth like the finest wine&#8221;</b><p>The bridegroom likens her mouth&#8212;voice, words, kisses&#8212;to the best vintage.<p>&#8226; Quality: not common table wine but the choicest, illustrating the supreme worth of her affection (<a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Sweetness: reminiscent of earlier praise, &#8220;Honey and milk are under your tongue&#8221; (Songs 4:11).<p>&#8226; Life-giving: just as good wine &#8220;gladdens the heart&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>), her speech and intimacy invigorate him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;may it flow smoothly to my beloved&#8221;</b><p>Now the bride interjects, echoing and completing his line.

The verse portrays mutual desire that flows freely, tenderly, and joyfully between husband and wife. Literally, it calls spouses to savor and nourish covenant intimacy with gracious speech and gentle affection. Spiritually, it foreshadows the exquisite communion between Christ and His redeemed people, where His life-giving words and our responsive love unite in everlasting joy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Causing the lips.</span>--The text in this verse has evidently undergone some change.
