The comparison to fawns suggests innocence and gentleness, reflecting the delicate and tender nature of love. In biblical times, fawns were seen as symbols of beauty and were often associated with peaceful and idyllic settings. This imagery emphasizes the natural and God-given beauty of the beloved, celebrating the physical aspect of love within the sanctity of marriage. The use of animal imagery is consistent with other parts of the Song of Solomon, where nature is frequently invoked to describe human emotions and relationships.<p><b>twins of a gazelle</b><br>The mention of "twins" highlights symmetry and harmony, suggesting a perfect and balanced beauty. Gazelles were admired for their elegance and swiftness, and in the context of the Song of Solomon, they symbolize the beloved's allure and charm. The reference to twins may also imply a sense of completeness and unity, reflecting the biblical ideal of two becoming one in marriage. This imagery can be seen as a celebration of the marital relationship, where both partners are equal and complementary. The gazelle, known for its grace and beauty, further underscores the admiration and affection the speaker has for the beloved. This phrase, like much of the Song, can be interpreted as an allegory of Christ's love for the Church, where the Church is seen as beautiful and cherished in the eyes of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse is the bridegroom, often interpreted as Solomon, who is expressing his admiration for his bride. The bride is often seen as a representation of the church or the individual believer in a spiritual allegory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>The bride is the recipient of the bridegroom's affection and admiration. She symbolizes purity, beauty, and the intimate relationship between Christ and the church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fawns_and_gazelle.htm">Fawns and Gazelle</a></b><br>These animals are symbols of beauty, grace, and gentleness in the ancient Near Eastern context.

Believers are called to cultivate these qualities in their interactions with others, reflecting Christ's love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_allegory.htm">Spiritual Allegory</a></b><br>While the Song of Solomon is a celebration of human love, it also serves as an allegory for the love between Christ and the church. This perspective invites believers to reflect on their relationship with Christ, characterized by intimacy, admiration, and devotion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_affirmation.htm">The Role of Affirmation</a></b><br>The bridegroom's words are a reminder of the power of affirmation in relationships.

The same imagery appears earlier: &#8220;Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle&#8221; (Songs 4:5).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18-19</a> the husband is exhorted to &#8220;be captivated always by her love,&#8221; affirming marital delight as righteous.<p>&#8226; The verse highlights the bride&#8217;s maturity; in biblical thought, fully formed breasts mark womanhood (<a href="/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>). That maturity points to readiness for the lifelong union God instituted in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>.<p>&#8226; By spotlighting a specific part of the body, the Song teaches spouses to notice, affirm, and cherish one another, echoing <a href="/ephesians/5-28.htm">Ephesians 5:28-29</a> where a husband is called to nourish and cherish his wife as his own body.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are like two fawns</b><p>Comparing the breasts to &#8220;two fawns&#8221; draws on gentle, skittish creatures.<p>&#8226; Fawns require tender handling; so marital intimacy calls for patience and sensitivity (<a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Fawns also symbolize freshness and youthful vigor (<a href="/psalms/29-9.htm">Psalm 29:9</a>). The husband sees his bride&#8217;s allure as vibrant and renewing, mirroring <a href="/lamentations/3-23.htm">Lamentations 3:23</a>&#8212;&#8220;His mercies are new every morning&#8221;&#8212;freshness that reflects God&#8217;s gracious gifts.<p>&#8226; The simile underscores purity. Just as young deer are untouched by toil, the bride&#8217;s beauty is presented as undefiled, resonating with <a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a> where Paul desires the church to be presented &#8220;as a pure virgin to Christ.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>twins of a gazelle</b><p>&#8220;Twins&#8221; emphasizes perfect symmetry, balance, and completeness.<p>&#8226; The matched pair speaks of God&#8217;s artistry in creation (<a href="/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a>) and of the wholeness He intends for husband and wife (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Gazelles are swift and free-spirited (<a href="/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>). Their mention adds a sense of playful energy to the couple&#8217;s love, reflecting <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a> where a man is urged to &#8220;enjoy life with your beloved wife all the days of your fleeting life.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The imagery also carries exclusivity: just as fawn-twins stay close together, the bride&#8217;s breasts belong to one man alone (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-3.htm">1 Corinthians 7:3-4</a>). Intimacy is not for casual display but for covenant enjoyment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/7-3.htm">Song of Solomon 7:3</a> paints marital love as God-honoring, tender, and exhilarating. The husband views his wife with delight, treating her with the gentleness due a pair of young, graceful deer. The verse celebrates physical beauty without shame, underscores sensitivity and exclusivity within marriage, and reminds readers that such affection is a good gift from the Creator who designed both body and covenant for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe.</span> So in <a href="/songs/4-5.htm">Song of Solomon 4:5</a>; but there the addition occurs, "which feed among the lilies."
