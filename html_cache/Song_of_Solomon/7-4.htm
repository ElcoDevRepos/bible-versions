In ancient times, towers were symbols of protection and grandeur. Ivory, a precious material, indicates purity and value. This metaphor highlights the beloved's noble character and esteemed position. The neck, often associated with will and determination, suggests a steadfast and upright nature. In biblical symbolism, towers can also represent a place of refuge and safety, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>, where the name of the Lord is described as a strong tower.<p><b>your eyes are like the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim;</b><br>Heshbon was a significant city in ancient Moab, known for its strategic location and abundant water sources. The pools of Heshbon would have been clear, tranquil, and life-sustaining, symbolizing depth, clarity, and serenity. The eyes, often seen as windows to the soul, reflect the inner beauty and peace of the beloved. The gate of Bath-rabbim, possibly a well-known entrance to the city, suggests accessibility and openness. This imagery may also connect to the idea of spiritual insight and understanding, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>, where the psalmist asks for open eyes to behold wondrous things.<p><b>your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, facing toward Damascus.</b><br>The tower of Lebanon likely refers to a prominent structure in the region known for its impressive height and strategic vantage point. Lebanon, famous for its cedars, was a place of beauty and strength. The nose, central to the face, symbolizes discernment and perception. Facing toward Damascus, a major city to the north, suggests a forward-looking perspective and awareness of the surrounding world. This imagery conveys a sense of alertness and readiness, akin to the watchfulness encouraged in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, where believers are urged to be sober-minded and

Mean</div><b>Your neck is like a tower made of ivory</b><p>&#8226; Ivory suggests purity and priceless beauty. The groom sees in his bride a flawless dignity that rises above all that is common, much as ivory stands out for its rarity (cf. <a href="/psalms/45-13.htm">Psalm 45:13&#8211;15</a> where the royal bride&#8217;s glory is emphasized).<p>&#8226; A &#8220;tower&#8221; evokes strength and stately stature, echoing an earlier compliment: &#8220;Your neck is like the tower of David&#8221; (Songs 4:4). Taken together, these images affirm that her character is upright, noble, and secure&#8212;attributes God desires in His people (<a href="/proverbs/31-25.htm">Proverbs 31:25</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal image of a graceful, straight neck supports the groom&#8217;s heartfelt praise of her physical beauty, yet Scripture simultaneously uses the metaphor to picture spiritual steadfastness (<a href="/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your eyes are like the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim</b><p>&#8226; Heshbon&#8217;s pools were famed for their crystal-clear, tranquil waters. The bride&#8217;s eyes convey peace, depth, and inviting refreshment, reflecting the calm confidence of one who is loved (Songs 1:15; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;By the gate&#8221; hints at accessibility. Her gaze welcomes rather than withholds&#8212;a picture of transparent trust within covenant love (<a href="/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Still waters also mirror; likewise, her eyes mirror the groom&#8217;s affection, reinforcing mutual delight (Songs 4:9&#8211;10; <a href="/james/1-23.htm">James 1:23&#8211;24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, facing toward Damascus</b><p>&#8226; The tower of Lebanon was a well-known lookout commanding a sweeping view toward Damascus. The bride&#8217;s profile is straight and finely shaped, but the imagery reaches further: her discernment is sharp, her sense of spiritual &#8220;scent&#8221; keen (<a href="/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; A tower also guards. The bride&#8217;s discernment protects the relationship, echoing wisdom&#8217;s watchfulness (<a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Facing outward, the tower stands unafraid; so the bride&#8217;s poise displays courage and confidence borne of love (<a href="/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a> layers vivid physical compliments with spiritual overtones. The groom delights in his bride&#8217;s purity (ivory), strength (tower), tranquility (pools), transparency (gate), discernment (tower of Lebanon), and confidence (facing Damascus). These qualities celebrate God-given beauty in marriage and picture the steadfast, peace-filled, discerning character He desires in all who belong to Him (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Fishpools in Heshbon.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">pools. </span>The Authorised Version follows the Vulg. <span class= "ital">piscin?, </span>for which there is no authority.

This is plainly a partial repetition of the king's description. The ivory tower was perhaps a tower well known, covered with ivory tablets, slender in structure, dazzlingly white in appearance, imposing and captivating. No doubt in the lips of the court ladies it is intended that this echo of the royal bridegroom's praises shall be grateful to him. Heshbon is situated some five and a half hours east of the northern points of the Dead Sea, on an extensive, undulating, fruitful, high table-land, with a far-reaching prospect. "The comparison of the eyes to a pool means either their glistening like a water-mirror or their being lovely in appearance, for the Arabian knows no greater pleasure than to look upon clear, gently rippling water: cf. Ovid, 'De Arte Am.,' 2:722 - <p><span class="foreign">"Adspicies oculos tremulo fulgore micantes,<br />Ut sol a liquida saepe refulget aqua"</span> The nose formed a straight line down from the forehead, conveying the impression of symmetry, and at the same time a dignity and majesty inspiring with awe like the tower of Lebanon. The reference is perhaps to a particular tower, and in the time of Solomon there were many noted specimens of architectural and artistic splendour. "A tower which looks in the direction of Damascus is to be thought of as standing on one of the eastern spurs of Hermon or on the top of Amana (<a href="/songs/4-8.htm">Song of Solomon 4:8</a>), whence the Amana (Barada) takes its rise, whether as a watchtower (<a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>) or only as a look out from which might be enjoyed the paradisaical prospect." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/7-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Your neck</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1512;&#1461;&#1430;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;aw&#183;w&#257;&#183;r&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
