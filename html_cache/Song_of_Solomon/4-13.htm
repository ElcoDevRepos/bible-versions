In ancient Israel, pomegranates were a symbol of abundance and blessing, often associated with the Promised Land (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>). The pomegranate's many seeds can symbolize fruitfulness and the potential for life. In the context of the Song of Solomon, this imagery may also reflect the intimate and life-giving nature of love within marriage. The branches suggest a spreading, nurturing quality, indicating growth and vitality.<p><b>with the choicest of fruits</b><br>The mention of "choicest of fruits" emphasizes the quality and excellence of what the beloved offers. In biblical times, fruit was a common metaphor for the results of one's life and actions (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16-20</a>). This phrase suggests that the beloved's character and virtues are of the highest quality, reflecting the best of what God has created. It also points to the idea of spiritual fruitfulness, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, where the fruits of the Spirit are listed.<p><b>with henna and nard</b><br>Henna and nard were both valuable and aromatic plants in the ancient Near East. Henna, used for its dye and fragrance, was often associated with beauty and adornment. Nard, or spikenard, was a costly perfume, mentioned in the New Testament as being used by Mary to anoint Jesus (<a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>). The inclusion of these elements in the description of the beloved suggests a richness and depth to her character and presence. It also hints at the sacrificial and precious nature of true love, drawing a parallel to the love of Christ, who was anointed before His burial.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse is Solomon, who is addressing his bride, often referred to as the Shulammite. The imagery used is a metaphor for her beauty and virtues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/orchard_of_pomegranates.htm">Orchard of Pomegranates</a></b><br>This imagery represents abundance, fertility, and beauty. Pomegranates were a symbol of love and desire in ancient cultures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/henna_and_nard.htm">Henna and Nard</a></b><br>These are aromatic plants. Henna was used for its fragrance and as a dye, while nard (spikenard) was a costly perfume, symbolizing value and preciousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_beauty_and_virtue.htm">Symbolism of Beauty and Virtue</a></b><br>The use of rich, natural imagery in this verse highlights the beauty and virtue of the beloved. In our lives, we should strive to cultivate inner beauty and virtues that reflect God's love and grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_fruitfulness.htm">Spiritual Fruitfulness</a></b><br>Just as the orchard is full of choice fruits, believers are called to bear spiritual fruit.

Like the &#8220;tree planted by streams of water&#8221; whose &#8220;leaf does not wither&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>), her life is fresh and fruitful.<p>- In marriage, Solomon is praising the Shulammite&#8217;s whole person&#8212;body, mind, spirit. Typologically, believers are &#8220;the branches&#8221; abiding in Christ the Vine (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>), so every grace that shows in us flows from that living connection.<p>- Practical takeaway: A vibrant spiritual life naturally extends blessing to others, just as healthy branches carry sap to budding fruit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are an orchard of pomegranates</b><p>- An &#8220;orchard&#8221; suggests abundance, order, and deliberate cultivation. Solomon sees more than random beauty; he beholds a well-tended garden.<p>- Pomegranates, with their many seeds, symbolize fruitfulness (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>, a land &#8220;of pomegranates&#8221;) and covenant blessing. The Lord promised His people an inheritance &#8220;not lacking anything&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>), and Solomon echoes that fullness in his bride.<p>- Marriage application: spouses are called to nurture one another so their union becomes a flourishing garden rather than a neglected field (<a href="/proverbs/24-30.htm">Proverbs 24:30-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the choicest of fruits</b><p>- &#8220;Choicest&#8221; points to quality, not mere quantity. The bride&#8217;s virtues are prime, not second-rate.<p>&#8226; Love that puts the other first (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</a>)<p>&#8226; Joy that strengthens (<a href="/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>)<p>&#8226; Peace that steadies (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>)<p>- For believers, the Holy Spirit produces &#8220;the fruit of the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). When Christ cultivates us, excellence replaces mediocrity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with henna and nard</b><p>- Henna (producing fragrant blossoms) and nard (a costly perfume&#8212;see <a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>) add the element of aroma. Fruit feeds; fragrance delights. Both are essential to complete beauty.<p>- The bride&#8217;s presence doesn&#8217;t merely satisfy need; it brings pleasure. Likewise, the Lord finds &#8220;a pleasing aroma&#8221; in the sacrifices of His people (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p>- Inviting aroma in marriage: words seasoned with grace (<a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>), attitudes that refresh (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>), actions that convey honor (<a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Solomon celebrates his bride as a living, fruitful, fragrant garden.

All the plants had their meaning in flower language. They are mostly exotics. But it is difficult now to suggest meanings, though they may have been familiar to Jewish readers at the time. The <span class="accented">pardes</span>, "park, or enclosure," was adorned especially with foreign and fragrant plants of great beauty. It is an Old Persian word, perhaps, as Delitzsch suggests, from <span class="accented">pairi</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>) and <span class="accented">dez</span> (Pers. <span class="accented">diz</span>), "a heap." <span class="accented">Precious fruit</span>; literally, <span class="accented">fructus laudam</span>, "fruits of renown" or excellence (cf. Syriac <span class="accented">magdo</span>, "dried fruit"). The <span class="accented">carcom</span>, or saffron, a kind of crocus (Ind. <span class="accented">safran</span>), yields the saffron colour from its dried flower eyes, used both as a cosmetic and as a medicine (cf. Sansc. <span class="accented">kuakuma</span>). The <span class="accented">calamus</span>, simply a reed, the sweet reed, a corn indigenous to the East. <span class="accented">Cinnamon</span> (<span class="accented">Quinnamon</span>)<span class="accented">, Laurus cinnamomum</span>, is indigenous on the east coast of Africa and Ceylon, found later in the Antibes. The inner bark peeled off and roiled together forms the cinnamon bark (see Pliny, bk. 12). There are seven spices mentioned. We need not trouble ourselves to identify them all, as they are mostly Indian, and such as Solomon would fetch from the far East in his celebrated ships. The description is highly poetical, and simply means that all sweetness and attractiveness combine in the fair one. But symbolically we may see an allusion to the spread of the Church over the world, and all the glory and honour of the nations" being introduced into it. So the graces of the individual soul expand themselves under the influence of Christian truth and fellowship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/4-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Your branches</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7717;a&#183;yi&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun -
