The term "Shulammite" is often understood to refer to a woman from Shunem, a village in the territory of Issachar. This could connect her to Abishag the Shunammite, who cared for King David in his old age (<a href="/1_kings/1-3.htm">1 Kings 1:3-4</a>). The call for her return suggests a desire for reconciliation or reunion, possibly symbolizing the relationship between God and Israel or Christ and the Church.<p><b>Come back, come back, that we may gaze upon you.</b><br>The desire to "gaze upon" the Shulammite indicates admiration and appreciation. In a spiritual sense, this can reflect the longing of believers to behold the beauty and glory of Christ. The repeated invitation underscores the value and worth seen in the Shulammite, paralleling how the Church is cherished by Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<p><b>Why do you look at the Shulammite,</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the audience to consider their motives and intentions. It suggests that the Shulammite's presence or actions are captivating and worthy of attention. In a broader sense, it can symbolize the allure of divine wisdom or the beauty of holiness that draws believers to God.<p><b>as on the dance of Mahanaim?</b><br>Mahanaim was a city east of the Jordan River, significant in biblical history as a place where Jacob encountered angels (<a href="/genesis/32.htm">Genesis 32:1-2</a>) and where David fled during Absalom's rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>). The "dance of Mahanaim" could refer to a celebratory or ritualistic dance, symbolizing joy and divine encounter.

Her very name links to peace (cf. Songs 1:7) and recalls the Shunammite woman who served David in his old age (<a href="/1_kings/1-3.htm">1 Kings 1:3&#8211;4</a>), highlighting purity and devotion.<p>&#8226; Their repeated plea underlines how captivating her presence is&#8212;much as the daughters of Jerusalem earlier admired her beauty (Songs 5:9&#8211;10).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, those who love Christ long for the manifest presence of His bride, the church (<a href="/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>), demonstrating that genuine godliness attracts a watching world.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Come back, come back, that we may gaze upon you.</b><p>&#8220;Come back, come back, that we may gaze upon you.&#8221; (Songs 6:13b)<p>&#8226; The desire to &#8220;gaze&#8221; exposes a danger: reducing holy beauty to mere spectacle (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>, where looking irreverently brings judgment).<p>&#8226; Solomon celebrates his bride&#8217;s splendor in marital intimacy (Songs 4:9&#8211;11), but public voyeurs risk turning sacred love into entertainment&#8212;echoing Samson&#8217;s humiliation when the Philistines forced him to perform (<a href="/judges/16-25.htm">Judges 16:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers must guard what is intimate with Christ, refusing to let holy affection become casual display (<a href="/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>; <a href="/john/21-21.htm">John 21:21&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why do you look at the Shulammite, as on the dance of Mahanaim?</b><p>&#8220;Why do you look at the Shulammite, as on the dance of Mahanaim?&#8221; (Songs 6:13c)<p>&#8226; The bride answers with a question, challenging the crowd&#8217;s motives. Mahanaim&#8212;&#8220;two camps&#8221;&#8212;is where Jacob saw angelic hosts (<a href="/genesis/32-1.htm">Genesis 32:1&#8211;2</a>) and later where David found refuge (<a href="/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>). It evokes a majestic, even heavenly procession, not a sideshow.<p>&#8226; By likening her to that &#8220;dance,&#8221; observers admit her movements mirror something divine and orderly (<a href="/psalms/149-3.htm">Psalm 149:3</a>). Yet her question reminds them that such glory belongs in worship, not voyeurism.<p>&#8226; In marriage, affectionate celebration is rightful (<a href="/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18&#8211;19</a>), but spectatorship perverts it. Likewise, Christ&#8217;s union with the church is wondrous, yet never for the world&#8217;s casual amusement (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Song 6:13 portrays onlookers enthralled by the Shulammite&#8217;s beauty, begging her return so they can stare at her &#8220;dance of Mahanaim.&#8221; Their fascination affirms the bride&#8217;s radiance, yet her probing question exposes motives that cheapen covenant intimacy. Literally, the passage safeguards marital love from public objectification. Spiritually, it cautions the church to keep her devotion to Christ reverent and holy, inviting observers not to gawk but to seek the Prince of Peace who grants such beauty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13a.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee.</span> Shulem is the same as Shunem (see <a href="/1_kings/1-3.htm">1 Kings 1:3</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>). Shulamite will, therefore, mean "lady of Shulem." It is the first occurrence of the name. It cannot be a pure proper name, says Delitzsch, because the article is attached to it. It is a name of descent. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "she who is from Shunem." Abishag was exceedingly beautiful, and she came from the same district. It is the country in the tribe of Issachar, near to little Hermon, to the southeast of Carmel and south of Nain, southeast of Nazareth, southwest of Tabor. It is found at present under the name <span class="accented">Sawlam</span>, not far from the great plain of Jiszeal (now <span class="accented">Zer'in</span>), "which forms a convenient way of communication between Jordan and the seacoast, but is yet so hidden in the mountain range that the Talmud is silent concerning this Sulem, as it is concerning Nazareth." It is impossible to resist the impression of the fact that this part of Galilee so closely associated with our Lord and his ministry should be the native place of the bride. Delitzsch thinks that the Shulamite is on her way from the garden to the palace. That the words are addressed to her by the admiring ladies can scarcely be disputed; hence the "we" of the address. "The fourfold 'come back' (or, 'turn') entreats her earnestly, yea, with team, to return thither (that is, to the garden) with them once more, and for this purpose, that they might find delight in looking upon her." But Delitzsch is scarcely right in thinking that the garden of nuts to which the bride referred is the garden of the palace. She is, perhaps, turning to leave the company of ladies, Solomon himself beingamong them, as though she would escape from their gaze, which is too much for her in her simplicity, and the ladies, seeing her intention to leave them, call her back. Another view is that the word "return" is for "turn round;" that is, "Let us see thee dance, that we may admire the beauty of thy form and movements." This would explain the appropriateness of the bride's reply in the latter haft of the verse. Moreover, the fourfold appeal is scarcely suitable if the bride was only slightly indicating her intention to leave. She would surely not leave hastily, seeing that Solomon is present. The request is not that she may remain, but that they may look upon her. It would be quite fitting in the mouth of lady companions. The whole is doubtless a poetic artifice, as before in the case of the dream, for the purpose of introducing the lovely description of her personal attractions. Plainly she is described as dancing or as if dancing. Delitzsch, however, thinks that the dance is only referred to by the ladies as a comparison; but in that case he certainly leaves unexplained the peculiarity of the description in <a href="/songs/7-1.htm">Song of Solomon 7:1-5</a>, which most naturally is a description of a dancing figure. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13b.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why will ye look upon the Shulamite as upon the dance of Mahanaim?</span> The Shulamite, in her perfect modesty and humility, not knowing how beautiful she really is, asks why it is that they wish still to gaze upon her, like those that gaze at the dance of Mahanaim, or why they wish her to dance. But at the same moment, with the complaisance of perfect amiability, begins to move - always a pleasure to a lovely maiden - thus filling them with admiration. Mahanaim came in later times to mean "angels," or the "heavenly host" (see <a href="/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>), but here it is generally thought to be the name of a dance, perhaps one in which the inhabitants of Mahanaim excelled, or one in which angels or hosts were thought to engage. The old translators, the Syriac, Jerome, and the Venetian, render, "the dances of the camps" (<span class="accented">choros castrarum</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), possibly a war dance or parade. The word, however, is in the dual. Delitzsch thinks the meaning is a dance as of angels, "only a step beyond the responsive song of the seraphim" (<a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>.). Of course, there can be no objection to the association of angels with the bride, but there is no necessity for it. The word would be, no doubt, familiarly known in the age of Solomon. The sacred dances wore often referred to in Scripture. and there would be nothing degrading to the dignity of the bride in dancing before the ladies and her own husband. "After throwing aside her upper garment, so that she had only the light clothing of a shepherdess or vine dresser, Shulamith danced to and fro before the daughters of Jerusalem, and displayed all her attractions before them." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/6-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Come back,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">come back,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1433;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O Shulammite!</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#363;&#183;lam&#183;m&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
