The longing expressed here reflects a desire for a socially acceptable way to express love and affection. In the context of the Song of Solomon, this phrase highlights the deep yearning for intimacy and closeness without societal constraints. The reference to a brother suggests a bond that is both natural and enduring, echoing the familial love seen in other biblical relationships, such as that of Joseph and his brothers (Genesis 37).<p><b>who nursed at my mother&#8217;s breasts!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the shared maternal bond, which in ancient times was a significant aspect of identity and relationship. The mention of nursing at the same mother's breasts underscores a deep, intrinsic connection, suggesting unity and equality. This imagery can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual kinship and unity in the body of Christ, where believers are nurtured by the same spiritual source (<a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>).<p><b>If I found you outdoors</b><br>The setting of "outdoors" implies a public space, contrasting with the private, intimate settings often depicted in the Song of Solomon. In biblical times, public encounters were subject to social scrutiny, and the desire to find the beloved outdoors suggests a wish for freedom from societal judgment. This can be paralleled with the freedom believers seek in expressing their faith openly, as seen in the boldness of the apostles in <a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>.<p><b>I would kiss you</b><br>A kiss in biblical times was a common expression of affection and greeting, as seen in the New Testament with the "holy kiss" (<a href="/romans/16-16.htm">Romans 16:16</a>). Here, the kiss symbolizes a desire for open and unashamed affection. It reflects the purity and sincerity of love that transcends societal norms, akin to the love Christ has for His church, which is both intimate and public.<p><b>and no one would despise me.</b><br>The concern for societal judgment is evident here, as public displays of affection between non-familial individuals could lead to scorn or misunderstanding. This reflects the tension between personal desire and social expectations. In a broader spiritual sense, it echoes the believer's struggle to live out their faith in a world that may not understand or accept it, as Jesus warned in <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-19</a>. The longing for acceptance without despise can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate acceptance believers find in Christ, who removes shame and condemnation (<a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shulammite_woman.htm">The Shulammite Woman</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing her longing for

She imagines meeting him in public, kissing him openly, and receiving only acceptance. The verse affirms the God-given goodness of marital love, highlights the tension between private passion and public propriety, and encourages believers to honor marriage with purity and confidence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">VIII.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">O that thou wert as my brother.</span>--The poet makes his beloved recall the feelings she had for him before the obstacles to their union were removed.

Marg., "They (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, her family and friends) should not <span class= "ital">despise </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., reproach</span>) me."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; and none would despise me. I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me; I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate. His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.</span> The meaning seems to be this - Let our relation to one another be the highest and the purest and the most permanent possible. The sisterly relation is not merely one of affection, but one of blood. The bond between husband and wife may be broken by the caprice and weakness of human feeling, but nothing can destroy the bond of blood. "A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity" (<a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>); "There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother" (<a href="/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>). The brotherly bond represents the strength of the blood relationship. When to that is added personal affection, then the tie is perfect. Shulamith means that she would have their love freed from all the uncertainties of human fickleness. As symbolically interpreted, therefore, we take this whole passage to signify that the Church, when it is desiring the closest fellowship with the Saviour, would be lifted above all the temptations of earthly life, which so often lower the standard of Christian feeling and service. The words are specially impressive in the lips of the bride of Solomon. It is a testimony to the inspiration of the whole book that the voluptuous monarch, whose life fell so far below the ideal of a godly king, should yet, indirectly though still powerfully, condemn and rebuke his own departure from God, setting clearly before us the surpassing excellence of pure love and the sanctity of married life. In the Mug's address to his bride he called her "sister" and "sister-bride;" she now virtually returns his own sentiment and calls him "brother."' She shows that she has risen in her love far above the mere fleshly desires - "the lust of the fiesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life." She would blend her whole existence with that of her Lord. <span class="accented">I would</span> <span class="accented">kiss thee</span>; <span class="accented">yea, and none would despise me.</span> Nothing can more exquisitely and delicately express the fulness of affection. It is not merely a return for that which is given; it is free and spontaneous. So should our spiritual feelings be. They should be the natural outpouring of the soul towards the Saviour; not a worked up, artificial, spasmodic impulse, not a cold, dead formalism, not an unsympathetic service of conscience; but "doing the will of God from the heart." "Love is the fulfilling of the Law;" "Faith worketh by love." The second verse is differently rendered by some. Jerome, Venetian, and Luther take it as referring to the bride's dependence on her husband's superior wisdom - "Thou wouldest instruct me;" which, of course, is a very suitable sentiment as addressed to the wise King Solomon. The Targum expounds it thus: "I would conduct thee, O King Messiah, and bring thee into the house of my sanctuary; and thou wouldest teach me to fear God and to walk in his ways." Hitzig and our Revisers take the verb as in the third person feminine, and applied to the mother. "She would teach me as a mother teaches a young bride, from her own early experience." The old view that the bride is the personification of wisdom seems quite refuted by this speech of Shulamith's. She desires and waits for instruction. Solomon is wisdom. She is the soul of man, or the Church of God, delighting to sit at his feet and learn of him. Whichever rendering we choose, whether the mother or Solomon be regarded as teacher, the meaning is the same. It is, as Delitzsch has observed, a deep revelation of Shulamith's heart. "She knew how much she yet came short of being to the king all that a wife should be. But in Jerusalem the bustle of court life and the burden of his regal duties did not permit him to devote himself to her; in her mother's house, if he were once there, he would in. struct her, and she would requite him with her spiced wine and with the juice of the pomegranates." The "spiced wine," <span class="accented">vinum conditura</span>, aromatic wine, probably grape wine "mixed with fragrant and pungent essences," as in the East. The juice, or pressed juice, of the pomegranate is a delicious drink. There is no allusion to any love symbol. The grains of the pomegranates were said by the Arabians to be from Paradise (cf. the <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, or "vinum de punicis quod roidem vocant" in Dioscorides and Pliny). Perhaps this reference to exchange of gifts may be taken as symbolizing the happy state of the Church when she pours out her treasures in response to the spiritual blessings which she is freely receiving. The meaning is something beautiful and precious. And that is the highest state of religious life when the service we render and the gifts we place on the altar are felt to be the grateful sacrifices of our hearts under a sense of Divine love. When the Church of Christ depends for its support on such fellowship between itself and the Saviour there will be no limits to its attainments, no achievements beyond its powers. "All that see" such a state of the Church "shall acknowledge" the glory of it, "that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed" (see the whole of the sixty-first chapter of Isaiah, which breathes the very spirit of Solomon's Song). The rejoicing bride then gives herself up to the thought of her husband's affection. In that beautiful simplicity and purity of her childhood's life she would realize the bliss of her new relation. Delitzsch describes her state of mind thus: "Resigning herself dreamily to the idea that Solomon is her brother, whom she may freely and openly kiss, and her teacher besides, with whom she may sit in confidential intercourse under her mother's eye, she feels herself as if closely embraced by him, and calls from a distance to the daughters of Jerusalem not to disturb this her happy enjoyment." Perhaps the sense of weakness and dependence is meant to be expressed. The bride is conscious that her lord is everything to her. In that identification which the highest love brings vividly into the soul, there is the joy of exultation.
