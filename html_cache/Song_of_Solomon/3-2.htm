The speaker, traditionally understood as the Shulammite woman, is motivated by love to take immediate action. In the ancient Near Eastern context, cities were often walled and had a network of streets and squares, suggesting a structured search. The city may symbolize the world or society, where one seeks fulfillment or spiritual truth. This search can be seen as a metaphor for the soul's quest for God, echoing the pursuit of wisdom in <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20-21</a>, where wisdom is personified and calls out in the streets.<p><b>through the streets and squares</b><br>The mention of streets and squares highlights the public nature of the search. In biblical times, these areas were central to community life, commerce, and social interaction. The imagery suggests a thorough and exhaustive search, leaving no area unexplored. This can be compared to the diligent search for wisdom and understanding in <a href="/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4-5</a>, where seeking is rewarded with the knowledge of God. The public setting may also imply vulnerability and risk, as cities could be places of danger, especially at night.<p><b>I will seek the one I love</b><br>The phrase underscores the personal and intimate nature of the search. The "one I love" is often interpreted as a representation of Christ or God, reflecting the deep longing of the believer for communion with the divine. This mirrors the New Testament theme of seeking Christ, as seen in <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-8</a>, where Jesus encourages believers to ask, seek, and knock. The pursuit of love here is not passive but active, demonstrating the believer's responsibility to seek God with all their heart, as emphasized in <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>.<p><b>So I sought him but did not find him</b><br>This expression of unfulfilled desire can reflect the spiritual experience of feeling distant from God, a theme found throughout the Psalms, such as in <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>, where the psalmist longs for God. The temporary absence of the beloved can serve as a test of faith and perseverance, encouraging deeper reliance on God. It also foreshadows the New Testament parable of the persistent widow in <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>, illustrating the importance of persistence in prayer and seeking God, even when immediate results are not apparent.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shulammite_woman.htm">The Shulammite Woman</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing her deep longing and search for her beloved.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Represents the setting of the search, symbolizing a place of human activity and interaction.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_streets_and_squares.htm">The Streets and Squares</a></b><br>These are the public places within the city where the search takes place, indicating a thorough and determined pursuit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The object of the Shulammite's affection, symbolizing a deep, personal relationship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_search.htm">The Search</a></b><br>An event of earnest seeking, reflecting the intensity of love and desire for union.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_true_love.htm">The Nature of True Love</a></b><br>True love involves a deep longing and a willingness to seek out the beloved, even when it requires effort and persistence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_seeking.htm">Spiritual Seeking</a></b><br>Just as the Shulammite seeks her beloved, believers are called to seek God with all their heart, soul, and mind.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_faith.htm">Perseverance in Faith</a></b><br>The search through the city symbolizes the perseverance required in our spiritual journey, even when immediate results are not visible.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_community.htm">The Role of Community</a></b><br>The city setting suggests that our search for God often takes place within the context of community and shared experiences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_pain_of_separation.htm">The Pain of Separation</a></b><br>The Shulammite's initial failure to find her beloved reflects the spiritual longing and pain that can occur when we feel distant from God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Song_of_Solomon_3_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Song of Solomon 3:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Song_of_Solomon_3_2_on_love_pursuit.htm">How does Song of Solomon 3:2 illustrate the pursuit of love in relationships?

Earnestly I seek You; my soul thirsts for You,&#8221;.<p>- Literal setting: the bride wakes in the night and decides to leave her chambers. Spiritual application: every disciple must rouse himself from complacency to pursue deeper fellowship with the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and go about the city</b><p>- She steps into public space, unashamed to search openly.<p>- This movement pictures seeking God in every sphere of life, not only in private devotion (<a href="/proverbs/8-34.htm">Proverbs 8:34</a> &#8220;Blessed is the man listening to me, watching daily at my doors,&#8221;).<p>- The city suggests complexity and distraction; love-driven pursuit cuts through it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through the streets and squares</b><p>- Streets and squares describe thorough, exhaustive searching&#8212;main roads and hidden corners alike.<p>- Comparable to <a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4</a>&#8217;s shepherd leaving the ninety-nine to scour the wilderness for one lost sheep.<p>- We are urged to pursue Christ in Scripture, prayer, fellowship, and service&#8212;every &#8220;street&#8221; of Christian practice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will seek the one I love</b><p>- The bride names her goal: &#8220;the one I love.&#8221; Love is the motive, not duty or fear (<a href="/1_john/4-19.htm">1 John 4:19</a> &#8220;We love because He first loved us,&#8221;).<p>- Seeking is active: <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a> &#8220;seek and you will find&#8221;.<p>- Literally, she hunts for Solomon; spiritually, believers pursue the Bridegroom, Jesus (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a> &#8220;My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me,&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So I sought him but did not find him</b><p>- Initial disappointment highlights seasons when God seems distant (<a href="/psalms/22-2.htm">Psalm 22:2</a> &#8220;I cry out by day, O my God, but You do not answer,&#8221;).<p>- Absence tests devotion, purifies motives, and intensifies desire (<a href="/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7</a> &#8220;For a brief moment I forsook you, but with great compassion I will bring you back,&#8221;).<p>- The narrative continues in verse 4 where reunion occurs; perseverance pays off (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a> &#8220;You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart,&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/3-2.htm">Song of Solomon 3:2</a> portrays a lover who refuses to rest until she finds her beloved. Her decisive rising, thorough search, and momentary failure model earnest, whole-hearted pursuit of the Lord. The verse calls believers to active, public, all-encompassing seeking, fueled by love, undeterred by temporary silence, confident that perseverance will lead to reunion with the One our souls adore.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">(I said) I will rise now, and go about the city, in the streets and in the broad ways; I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</span> Delitzsch renders, "So I will arise, then." The words of the maiden are quite inconsistent with the hypothesis of a shepherd lover, for in that case she would seek him, not in the streets, but outside the city. Some think the city referred to is Jerusalem, with its markets and streets - the royal city (cf. <a href="/proverbs/7-11.htm">Proverbs 7:11</a>). If it is a dream, it will be unnecessary to decide to what city the words refer. The idea of the speaker would seem to be either that she was at the time within the walls of the city referred to, or that she was in some dwelling near. But a dream is not always consistent with the real circumstances of the dreamer. Taking it as a reminiscence of first love, it seems better to understand the city as only imaginary, or some neighbouring town in the north. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will arise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1511;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;q&#363;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect Cohortative - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6965.htm">Strong's 6965: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arise, stand up, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4994.htm">Strong's 4994: </a> </span><span class="str2">I pray', 'now', 'then'</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and go about</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;s&#333;&#183;w&#7687;&#183;&#7687;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
