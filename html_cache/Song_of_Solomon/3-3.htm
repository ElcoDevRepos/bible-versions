This imagery reflects a sense of vigilance and protection. The presence of watchmen suggests a setting within a walled city, likely Jerusalem, which was known for its fortified walls. Theologically, watchmen can symbolize spiritual leaders or prophets who are tasked with guiding and protecting the people (<a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>). The encounter with the watchmen may also represent a search for guidance or wisdom, as the watchmen are figures of authority and knowledge.<p><b>&#8220;Have you seen the one I love?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase expresses a deep longing and desire for the beloved, a central theme in the Song of Solomon. The search for the beloved can be seen as a metaphor for the soul's search for God or Christ, reflecting the intimate relationship between the divine and the believer. The question posed to the watchmen indicates a sense of urgency and desperation, highlighting the intensity of the speaker's love. In a broader biblical context, this longing can be compared to the yearning for God seen in Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>, "As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God." The beloved in this context can also be seen as a type of Christ, the ultimate object of love and devotion for the believer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_watchmen.htm">The Watchmen</a></b><br>These are the guards or sentinels who patrol the city, ensuring its safety.

Scripture always presents watchmen as protectors placed by God (<a href="/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Her meeting them reminds us that God-appointed guardians can aid or test our pursuit of what matters most. As in <a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>, &#8220;Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain&#8221;, these men symbolize both human vigilance and divine oversight.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, believers often cross paths with shepherds of the flock (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>) while seeking closer fellowship with Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on their rounds of the city</b><p>&#8226; The guards are patrolling, indicating diligence and order. Their routine contrasts with the bride&#8217;s restless search; routine service meets passionate longing.<p>&#8226; The night setting underscores urgency&#8212;similar to the call to be sober and alert because &#8220;your adversary the devil prowls around&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The city represents community. Love is not pursued in isolation; even our most personal quests touch the broader body of believers (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Have you seen the one I love?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The bride&#8217;s question is direct and singular: &#8220;the one.&#8221; Her heart is undivided (Songs 2:16; 6:3).<p>&#8226; She assumes the watchmen might know where he is&#8212;just as Mary Magdalene asked, &#8220;Tell me where you have put Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15</a>). True love boldly enlists help.<p>&#8226; Her words echo the believer&#8217;s cry for deeper intimacy with Christ, counting &#8220;everything as loss compared to the surpassing excellence of knowing Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/3-3.htm">Song of Solomon 3:3</a> pictures a devoted bride crossing paths with vigilant guardians while urgently seeking her beloved. Literally, it records an historical nighttime search; spiritually, it illustrates the believer&#8217;s earnest pursuit of the Lord amid the safeguards and structures God places around us. The verse invites us to keep our love focused, our search active, and our respect for God-given watchmen intact until we, like the bride, find the One our soul loves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">The watchmen that go about the city</span>.--"Henceforward until morning the streets are deserted and silent, with only here and there a company returning from a visit, with a servant bearing a lantern before them. The city-guard creeps softly about in utter darkness, and apprehends all found walking in the streets without a light" (Thomson, <span class= "ital">Land and Book, </span>p. 32--in description of Beir-t).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The watchmen that go about the city found me:</span> (to whom I said) <span class="cmt_word">Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?</span> The simplicity of these words is very striking. They confirm the view that the bride is recalling what occurred in her country life. The watchmen make no reply, and do not treat her ill, as in the dream related in <a href="/songs/5-7.htm">Song of Solomon 5:7</a>, where they are keepers of the walls, and smite her and wound her. In a small country town she might have been recognized, or known to be really in trouble. But such incidents must not be pressed too much in a poem. The allegorical view finds considerable support in the fact that it is difficult on any hypothesis exactly to explain the language as descriptive of real occurrences. In such instances as <a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a> the reference to watchmen in the city shows that such a metaphor would be familiarly understood. Whether adopted from Solomon's Song or not, the figure of a city watched and guarded, and the people of God as watching for the glory of Zion, was common in the prophetic writings. The soul seeking for its object and for the restoration of its peace calls in the aid of the faithful guardians of the holy city, the friends alike of the Saviour and of those who desire to be his. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I encountered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural &#124;
