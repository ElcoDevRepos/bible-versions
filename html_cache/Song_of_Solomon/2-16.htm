In the context of marriage, it emphasizes the exclusivity and commitment inherent in the marital bond. This mirrors the covenantal language found in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19-20</a>, where God speaks of betrothing His people to Himself in faithfulness. Theologically, this can also be seen as a type of Christ and the Church, as described in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-32</a>, where the relationship between husband and wife is likened to that of Christ and His bride, the Church. The mutual belonging signifies a profound unity and love that is both personal and communal.<p><b>he pastures his flock among the lilies.</b><br>This imagery draws from the pastoral and agrarian context of ancient Israel, where shepherding was a common occupation. The mention of "lilies" suggests a setting of beauty and tranquility, indicating a place of provision and care. In a spiritual sense, this can be seen as a metaphor for Christ as the Good Shepherd, who tends to His flock with love and gentleness, as seen in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-15</a>. The lilies may also symbolize purity and renewal, reflecting the sanctifying work of Christ in the lives of believers. Additionally, the pastoral imagery connects to <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where the Lord is depicted as a shepherd who leads His people to green pastures and still waters, providing for their needs and ensuring their well-being.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>In the context of the Song of Solomon, the beloved is often interpreted as Solomon or a representation of a lover.

The latter clause is repeated in <a href="/songs/6-2.htm">Song of Solomon 6:2</a>, with the addition, "in the gardens," and it is evident that Solomon is lovingly regarded as a shepherd, because Shulamith delights to think of him as fully sympathizing with her simple country life. She idealizes. The words may be taken as either the response given at the time by the maiden to the invitation of her lover to come forth into the vineyards, or as the breathing of love as she lies in the arms of Solomon. Lilies are the emblem of purity, lofty elevation above that which is common. Moreover, the lily stalk is the symbol of the life of regeneration among the mystical mediaevalists. Mary the Virgin, the <span class="accented">Rosa mystica</span>, in ancient paintings is represented with a lily in her hand at the Annunciation. The people of God were called by the Jewish priests "a people of lilies." So Mary was the lily of lilies in the lily community; the <span class="accented">sanctissima</span> in the <span class="accented">communio sanctorum.</span> There may be an allusion to the lily forms around Solomon in his palace - the daughters of Jerusalem; in that ease the words must be taken as spoken, not in remembrance of the first love, but in present joy in Solomon's embrace. Some would render the words as simply praise of Solomon himself, "who, wherever he abides, spreads radiancy and loveliness about him," or "in whose footsteps roses and lilies ever bloom." At least, they are expressive of entire self-surrender and delight. She herself is a lily, and the beloved one feeds upon her beauty, purity, and perfection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/2-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">My beloved</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1730.htm">Strong's 1730: </a> </span><span class="str2">To love, a love-token, lover, friend, an uncle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is mine</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">and I am his;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he pastures [his flock]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1506;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;&#8216;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7462.htm">Strong's 7462: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tend a, flock, pasture it, in, to graze, to rule, to associate with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">among the lilies.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#353;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;an&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7799.htm">Strong's 7799: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lily, as a, flower of architectural ornament, a, trumpet</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/songs/2-16.htm">Song of Solomon 2:16 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/songs/2-16.htm">Song of Solomon 2:16 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/songs/2-16.htm">Song of Solomon 2:16 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/songs/2-16.htm">Song of Solomon 2:16 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/songs/2-16.htm">Song of Solomon 2:16 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/songs/2-16.htm">Song of Solomon 2:16  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/songs/2-16.htm">Song of Solomon 2:16 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/songs/2-16.htm">Song of Solomon 2:16 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/songs/2-16.htm">Song of Solomon 2:16 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/songs/2-16.htm">Song of Solomon 2:16 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/songs/2-16.htm">OT Poetry: Song of Solomon 2:16 My beloved is mine and (Song Songs SS So Can)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/songs/2-15.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Song of Solomon 2:15"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 2:15" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/songs/2-17.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Song of Solomon 2:17"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 2:17" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
