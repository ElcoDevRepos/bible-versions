The comparison of teeth to a flock of sheep suggests purity and cleanliness, as sheep coming up from the washing would be white and spotless. This imagery reflects the bride's beauty and purity, emphasizing her attractiveness and the care she takes in her appearance. In biblical times, sheep were a valuable asset, symbolizing wealth and prosperity, which may also imply the bride's value and worth. The washing process can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual cleansing, aligning with themes of purification found in passages like <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>, where David asks to be washed whiter than snow.<p><b>each has its twin,</b><br>The mention of each tooth having its twin suggests symmetry and completeness, indicating that the bride's beauty is perfect and unmarred. In the context of ancient Israel, symmetry was often associated with divine order and perfection, reflecting God's creation as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. This imagery can also be connected to the idea of unity and harmony within the body of Christ, as Paul describes in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>, where each member has its place and function, contributing to the whole.<p><b>and not one of them is lost.</b><br>This phrase highlights the idea of preservation and care. In a historical context, dental health was a significant concern, and having all teeth intact would be a sign of good health and vitality. Spiritually, this can be seen as a metaphor for God's preservation of His people, as seen in <a href="/john/6-39.htm">John 6:39</a>, where Jesus speaks of losing none of those given to Him by the Father. It underscores the theme of divine protection and the completeness found in a relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse is the bridegroom, often interpreted as Solomon, who is expressing admiration for his bride.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>The bride is the recipient of the bridegroom's praise, symbolizing purity and beauty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>The imagery of sheep is used to convey purity and order, as they are freshly washed and perfectly paired.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_washing.htm">The Washing</a></b><br>This refers to the cleansing process, symbolizing purity and renewal.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/twins.htm">Twins</a></b><br>The mention of twins emphasizes symmetry and completeness, suggesting perfection in creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_purity.htm">Symbolism of Purity</a></b><br>The imagery of washed sheep highlights the importance of spiritual purity and renewal in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_completeness.htm">Value of Completeness</a></b><br>Just as the bride's teeth are perfectly paired, we should strive for completeness and integrity in our spiritual walk.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/appreciation_of_beauty.htm">Appreciation of Beauty</a></b><br>The bridegroom's admiration for the bride teaches us to appreciate the beauty and gifts God has given us and others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_cleansing.htm">Spiritual Cleansing</a></b><br>The washing of the sheep symbolizes the cleansing power of God's forgiveness and grace in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_harmony.htm">Unity and Harmony</a></b><br>The perfect pairing of the teeth reflects the unity and harmony that should exist within the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Song_of_Solomon_6_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Song of Solomon 6:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Song_of_Solomon_6_6_on_pure_beauty.htm">How does Song of Solomon 6:6 illustrate the beauty of purity in relationships?
