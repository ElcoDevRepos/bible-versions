They are mentioned in <a href="/genesis/30-14.htm">Genesis 30:14-16</a>, where Rachel and Leah discuss them in the context of childbearing. The mention of mandrakes here may symbolize love, desire, and the hope for fruitfulness in the relationship. The fragrance suggests an alluring and inviting atmosphere, enhancing the romantic and intimate setting of the Song of Solomon.<p><b>and at our door is every delicacy</b><br>The imagery of delicacies at the door suggests abundance and readiness to share in the pleasures of love. In ancient Near Eastern culture, hospitality and the sharing of food were significant expressions of love and commitment. This phrase may also symbolize the richness and variety of love, indicating that the relationship is full of delightful experiences and blessings.<p><b>new as well as old</b><br>The mention of both new and old delicacies highlights the continuity and growth in the relationship. It suggests that the love shared is both rooted in past experiences and continually renewed with fresh expressions. This can be seen as a metaphor for the enduring and evolving nature of true love, which cherishes past memories while embracing new opportunities for connection.<p><b>that I have treasured up for you</b><br>The act of treasuring up indicates intentionality and care in preserving and preparing these delights. It reflects a deep commitment to the beloved, showing that the speaker has thoughtfully gathered and saved these pleasures for their partner. This can be seen as a parallel to the way God treasures His people, preparing blessings and experiences for them.<p><b>my beloved</b><br>The term "beloved" is a recurring theme throughout the Song of Solomon, emphasizing the deep affection and personal connection between the lovers. It reflects a covenantal relationship, echoing the language used in other parts of Scripture to describe God's love for His people, such as in <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>.

Just as that aroma filled the room, covenant love fills the marriage and testifies to God&#8217;s goodness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At our door is every delicacy</b><p>&#8226; The doorway marks the couple&#8217;s shared home&#8212;love enjoyed within the boundaries God designed (Songs 8:6-7).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Every delicacy&#8221; paints a table heaped with delights, echoing, &#8220;He brought me to the banqueting house&#8221; (Songs 2:4) and, spiritually, &#8220;They feast on the abundance of Your house&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The placement &#8220;at our door&#8221; stresses readiness.

Galilee, where Shulamith was brought up. The Arabs called them <span class="accented">abd-el-sal'm</span>, "servant of love" - <span class="accented">postillon d'amour.</span> We are not wrong in using that which is perfectly natural and simple for the cherishing and increasing of devout feeling. The three elements which coexist in true spiritual life are thought, feeling, and action. They support one another. A religion which is all impulse and emotion soon wears itself out, and is apt to end in spiritual vacuity and paralysis; but when thought and activity hold up and strengthen and guide feeling, then it is scarcely possible to endanger the soul. The heart should go out to Christ in a simple but fervent worship, especially in praise. There are no Christians who are more ready to devote themselves to good works than those who delight much in hearty and happy spiritual songs. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/7-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The mandrakes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(had&#183;d&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
