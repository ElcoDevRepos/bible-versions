The imagery of a "rounded goblet" suggests beauty and abundance, as goblets were used in festive and sacred contexts. This metaphor may also imply a sense of completeness and perfection. The goblet, a vessel for wine, can symbolize joy and celebration, which are central themes in the Song of Solomon. The navel's comparison to a goblet may also reflect the intimate and cherished nature of the beloved, emphasizing her desirability and the joy she brings.<p><b>it never lacks blended wine.</b><br>Wine in biblical times was a symbol of joy, prosperity, and divine blessing. The phrase "never lacks blended wine" suggests an unending source of joy and satisfaction. Blended wine, often mixed with spices, was considered a luxury, indicating the richness and depth of the beloved's character and the relationship. This imagery can also be seen as a reflection of the abundance and generosity of God's love, as wine is frequently used in Scripture to symbolize divine blessing and covenant (e.g., <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>, the wedding at Cana).<p><b>Your waist is a mound of wheat</b><br>Wheat is a staple grain, symbolizing sustenance, fertility, and prosperity. The comparison of the waist to a "mound of wheat" suggests fruitfulness and abundance. In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, wheat was a critical part of daily life and a sign of God's provision. This imagery may also evoke the harvest, a time of joy and celebration, further emphasizing the themes of abundance and blessing. The waist, as a central part of the body, represents strength and stability, qualities that are admired in the beloved.<p><b>encircled by the lilies.</b><br>Lilies are often associated with beauty, purity, and love in biblical literature. The image of the waist being "encircled by the lilies" suggests a sense of grace and elegance. Lilies are mentioned elsewhere in the Song of Solomon (e.g., 2:1-2), reinforcing the theme of natural beauty and the beloved's allure. This phrase may also symbolize the protective and nurturing aspect of love, as the lilies encircle and adorn the mound of wheat. In a broader biblical context, lilies can represent the beauty of creation and God's care for His people (e.g., <a href="/matthew/6-28.htm">Matthew 6:28-29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse is the bridegroom, often interpreted as Solomon, who is expressing admiration for his bride.

Her navel is likened to an elegant, ever-filled cup, offering continual joy; her waist to a fruitful mound of wheat, framed by lilies that speak of purity and loveliness. Within covenant marriage, God invites husband and wife to delight in one another&#8217;s bodies without shame, to experience unending satisfaction, and to anticipate the fruitfulness&#8212;both relational and generational&#8212;that flows from their union (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>; <a href="/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Heap of wheat set about with lilies.</span>--Wetstein (quoted by Delitzsch in his Appendix) remarks that in Syria the colour of wheat is regarded as the most beautiful colour the human body can have; and after remarking on the custom of decorating the heaps of winnowed corn with flowers in token of the joy of harvest, says:--"The appearance of such heaps of wheat, which one may see in long parallel rows on the threshing-floors of a village, is very pleasing to a peasant; and the comparison of the Song (<a href="/songs/7-5.htm" title="Your head on you is like Carmel, and the hair of your head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.">Song of Solomon 7:5</a>) every Arabian will regard as beautiful."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy navel is like a round goblet, wherein no mingled wine is wanting: thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.</span> It must be remembered that ladies are speaking of one who is in the ladies' apartment. There is nothing indelicate in the description, though it is scarcely Western. The "round goblet," or basin, with mixed wine, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wine with water or snow mixed with it, is intended to convey the idea of the shape of the lovely body with its flesh colour appearing through the semitransparent clothing, and moving gracefully like the diluted wine in the glass goblet. The navel is referred to simply as the center of the body, which it is in infants, and nearly so in adults. Perhaps Delitzsch is right in thinking that there may be an attempt to describe the navel itself as like the whirling hollow of water in a basin. In the latter part of the verse the shape of the body is undoubtedly intended. "To the present day winnowed and sifted corn is piled up in great heaps of symmetrical, half-spherical form, which are then frequently stuck over with things that move in the wind, for the purpose of protecting them against birds. The appearance of such heaps of wheat," says Wetstein, "which one may see in long parallel rows on the threshing floors of a village, is very pleasing to a peasant; and the comparison of the song every Arabian will regard as beautiful." According to the Moslem Sunnas, the colour of wheat was that of Adam. The white is a subdued white, denoting both perfect spotlessness and the purity of health. The smooth, round, fair body of the maiden is seen to advantage in the varied movements of the dance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/7-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Your navel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;r&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
