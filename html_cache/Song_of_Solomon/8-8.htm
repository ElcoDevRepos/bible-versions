In the cultural context of ancient Israel, family bonds were strong, and siblings often played significant roles in each other's lives. The mention of a "little sister" suggests youth and innocence, highlighting the protective nature of the family. This can be seen as a metaphor for the church or believers who are young in faith, needing guidance and protection.<p><b>and her breasts are not yet grown.</b><br>This phrase symbolizes immaturity and the process of coming of age. In the historical context, physical maturity was often linked to readiness for marriage. The imagery here suggests that the sister is not yet ready for the responsibilities and commitments of adult life. Spiritually, this can be seen as a representation of believers who are still growing in their faith and understanding, not yet ready for deeper spiritual responsibilities.<p><b>What shall we do for our sister</b><br>This question reflects a proactive concern for the sister's future. It implies a desire to prepare and protect her, ensuring she is ready for the next stage of life. In biblical terms, this can be seen as the responsibility of the church to nurture and prepare young believers for spiritual maturity. It echoes the biblical principle of discipleship and mentorship found in passages like <a href="/titus/2-4.htm">Titus 2:4-5</a>, where older women are encouraged to teach and guide younger women.<p><b>on the day she is spoken for?</b><br>This phrase refers to the time when the sister will be betrothed or married. In ancient Israel, marriage was a significant event, often arranged by families, and marked the transition to adulthood. The "day she is spoken for" signifies a future commitment and the need for readiness. Prophetically, this can be seen as a type of the church being prepared as the bride of Christ, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-8</a>, where the church is made ready for the marriage supper of the Lamb.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shulammite_woman.htm">The Shulammite Woman</a></b><br>The central female figure in the Song of Solomon, often interpreted as a bride or beloved.

The brothers&#8217; observation distinguishes natural growth from moral permission; Song of Solomon keeps marital intimacy within God-ordained timing, echoing the repeated charge in 2:7; 3:5; 8:4 not to &#8220;awaken love until it pleases.&#8221;<p>&#8226;

The verse champions responsible guardianship, patient growth, and wise preparation for covenant marriage, principles that apply to family life and to the church&#8217;s nurturing of new believers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">We have a little sister.</span>--Commentators are almost all at one in the feeling that the poem properly ends with <a href="/songs/8-7.htm" title="Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.">Song of Solomon 8:7</a>. Those who construct the poem on the plan of a drama can find no proper place for what follows (unless as a meaningless epilogue), and the want of cohesion with the main body of the work is so evident that many scholars have rejected it as a later addition; others have tried to find a place for it by re-arranging the whole poem. But if the various sections are, as above explained, only a succession of different presentments of the same story of courtship and marriage, made without any regard to order, but simply as they occurred to the memory of the poet, this conclusion presents no difficulty, either from its position or its meaning. With a view to artistic form, we might wish it away or in some other part of the poem; but the author had no regard to artistic form, or not the same conception of it as we have.<p><span class= "bld">A little sister </span>. . .--The recollection is carried back to the childhood of the bride. Her brothers are supposed to be debating how to deal with her when an offer of marriage should be made for her.<p><span class= "bld">In the day when she shall be spoken for?</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, asked in marriage (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/25-29.htm" title="Yet a man is risen to pursue you, and to seek your soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD your God; and the souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.">1Samuel 25:29</a>). At present she is unmarriageable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</span> The term "little" refers, of course, to her tender age, as in <a href="/2_kings/5-2.htm">2 Kings 5:2</a>, the "little maid;" and in <a href="/genesis/44-20.htm">Genesis 44:20</a>, "a child of his old age, a little one," referring to Benjamin. "She hath no breasts" is equivalent to saying she is not yet mature, of marriageable age (see <a href="/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>). The question which the bride asks of King Solomon refers to the promise which he is supposed to have made, and which he is virtually pledging himself to fulfil by this visit to the country home of his queen. "What shall be done for the advantage of my little sister? Let us consult together" (cf. <a href="/genesis/27-37.htm">Genesis 27:37</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>). "The day when she shall be spoken for" is the day when she shall attract the attention of a suitor. It must necessarily be difficult to find satisfactory interpretations forevery detail in such a poem of human love as this. It might be sufficient to see in this reference to the younger sister the general idea of love's expansion. Those who are themselves the objects of it, being full of exquisite happiness, desire to call others into the same joy. This is true both of the individual and of the Church. <span class="accented">What shall be done for others?</span> That is the question which is awakened in every heart where true love is at work. There is no need to explain the language further. But the allegorists have been very ingenious in attempting to find meanings forevery allusion of the poem. Who is the little sister? What is her virginity? What is the day in which she shall be spoken for? Some have said that the little sister represents the firstfruits of the Jews and Gentiles received into the Christian Church immediately after the time of our Lord's ascension, as Beza and others. Some, again, take it to mean the whole body of Jews and Gentiles yet to be converted. Others would see in it those that are weak in faith, the beginners in Christian life. And, again, it has been regarded as pointing to the "daughter of Zion" at the time of the first beginnings of her conversion to the heavenly Solomon, which is the view of Hengstenberg and others. There is no end to such fancies. The broad general meaning is all that we can rest upon. The bride naturally thinks of her sister. It is a lovely incident in a perfectly idyllic poem. The visit to the home is quite in harmony with the fresh, pure, and simple life which reveals itself in all the utterances of the bride, and is honoured by the devoted attention of the splendid monarch. It is a real touch of nature when the young bride, in her family life once more, asks what shall become of her sister. It is an exquisite type of that sisterly solicitude with which all true Christians will care for the souls around them. Delitzsch thinks that the question which is asked by the bride is answered by her brothers, as they were the actual guardians of the little sister (see <a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21</a>:50, 55; 34:6-8). But there is no necessity to introduce any new interlocutors at this point. The words are certainly addressed to Solomon. It is quite natural that he should reply to them in a royal style, with the <span class="accented">pluralis majestatis</span> which suits the corresponding position of the bride as a suppliant for her sister. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/8-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">We have a little</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1496;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;&#7789;an&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6996.htm">Strong's 6996: </a> </span><span class="str2">Small, young, unimportant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sister,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_269.htm">Strong's 269: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sister -- a sister</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and her breasts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1430;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
