Doves are often associated with the Holy Spirit, as seen in the New Testament during Jesus' baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>). The comparison to doves suggests a sense of calmness and tranquility, reflecting the character of the beloved. In the context of the Song of Solomon, this imagery emphasizes the deep affection and admiration between the lovers, highlighting the beauty and serenity found in their relationship.<p><b>beside the streams of water</b><br>Streams of water in biblical literature often symbolize life, refreshment, and sustenance. In <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, a righteous person is likened to a tree planted by streams of water, indicating prosperity and vitality. The placement of the eyes beside streams of water suggests a sense of refreshment and life-giving presence, enhancing the imagery of purity and peace. This can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual nourishment and the life-giving nature of a relationship grounded in love and faithfulness.<p><b>bathed in milk</b><br>Milk in the Bible is often a symbol of abundance and nourishment, as seen in references to the Promised Land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The imagery of eyes bathed in milk suggests a sense of richness and purity. It conveys the idea of being enveloped in something pure and nourishing, enhancing the beauty and clarity of the eyes. This phrase underscores the idea of the beloved's eyes being not only beautiful but also full of life and vitality.<p><b>and mounted like jewels</b><br>Jewels are symbols of value, beauty, and rarity. In biblical times, jewels were highly prized and often used in the adornment of kings and priests, as seen in the descriptions of the high priest's breastplate (<a href="/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17-20</a>). The comparison of the eyes to jewels suggests that they are precious and captivating. This imagery highlights the beloved's worth and the deep admiration felt by the speaker. It also reflects the idea of being treasured and esteemed, much like the relationship between Christ and the Church, where believers are seen as precious in the eyes of God (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The primary subject of this verse, often interpreted as a representation of Christ in allegorical readings, symbolizing purity, peace, and love.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shulammite.htm">The Shulammite</a></b><br>The speaker in the Song of Solomon, traditionally understood as the bride or the church, expressing admiration and love for the Beloved.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/doves.htm">Doves</a></b><br>Symbolic of peace, purity, and the Holy Spirit, often used in biblical literature to convey innocence and gentleness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/streams_of_water.htm">Streams of Water</a></b><br>Represents life, purity, and refreshment, often associated with spiritual nourishment and the Word of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewels.htm">Jewels</a></b><br>Symbolize value, beauty, and preciousness, indicating the worth and splendor of the Beloved's attributes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/purity_and_peace.htm">Purity and Peace</a></b><br>The eyes of the Beloved, like doves, remind us of the purity and peace that should characterize our relationship with Christ.

(Songs 5:12) paints a picture of eyes that are gentle, pure, and peace-giving.<p>&#8226; Doves symbolize innocence and faithful devotion&#8212;Noah&#8217;s dove seeking rest (<a href="/genesis/8-9.htm">Genesis 8:9-12</a>) and the Spirit descending on Jesus &#8220;like a dove&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>) both evoke calm assurance.<p>&#8226; In 10:16 Jesus tells His disciples to be &#8220;innocent as doves,&#8221; linking the image to moral purity.<p>&#8226; Earlier, the bride had said to her beloved, &#8220;Your eyes are like doves&#8221; (Songs 1:15), showing that this is a settled trait, not a passing mood.<p>&#8226; For believers, the Lord&#8217;s gaze is never harsh or condemning (<a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>) but full of kindness that leads to repentance (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>).<p>In short, the eyes described here radiate purity and peace, assuring the bride&#8212;and us&#8212;of unwavering love.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>beside the streams of water</b><p>The phrase shifts the focus to location: &#8220;beside the streams of water.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Eyes compared to doves resting at a stream suggest refreshment and vitality; still waters calm and nourish (<a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Trees planted by streams never wither (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>). Likewise, the beloved&#8217;s character is continually replenished; nothing in His gaze is dry or lifeless.<p>&#8226; Jesus invites the thirsty to drink &#8220;living water&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>). His eyes, fixed on us, lead us to that same life-giving flow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>bathed in milk</b><p>&#8220;Bathed in milk&#8221; adds a vivid layer of clarity and brightness.<p>&#8226; Milk is pure, nourishing, and white. The whiteness points to unclouded vision&#8212;eyes unstained by deceit (<a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a> speaks of &#8220;pure spiritual milk,&#8221; tying purity and nourishment together).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> contrasts scarlet sin with whitening forgiveness; the beloved&#8217;s eyes already possess that bright, forgiving quality.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/19-8.htm">Psalm 19:8</a> notes that God&#8217;s commandment &#8220;gives light to the eyes.&#8221; Lighted, milk-washed eyes see clearly and impart clarity to those they behold.<p>There is no darkness, confusion, or hidden agenda in this lover&#8217;s look&#8212;only purity that strengthens.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>mounted like jewels</b><p>Finally, the eyes are &#8220;mounted like jewels.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jewels are precious, beautifully set, and intentionally displayed. <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm">Malachi 3:17</a> calls the faithful His &#8220;treasured possession,&#8221; revealing God&#8217;s own valuation system.<p>&#8226; Jewel-mounting hints at symmetry and permanence&#8212;eyes firmly fixed in devotion, not wandering.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/21-11.htm">Revelation 21:11</a> describes the glory of God&#8217;s city &#8220;like a most precious jewel.&#8221; The beloved&#8217;s eyes share that same brilliant, enduring worth.<p>&#8226; In relationship terms, the bridegroom&#8217;s gaze fixes on his bride as a priceless treasure (Songs 4:9, &#8220;You have captivated my heart with a single glance of your eyes&#8221;).<p>Every time she meets his eyes, she reads unfading value and undivided attention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Song 5:12 stacks four images&#8212;doves, streams, milk, and jewels&#8212;to reveal eyes that are pure, refreshing, radiant, and priceless. Literally, the bridegroom&#8217;s gaze is steady and gentle; figuratively, it mirrors the Lord&#8217;s own look toward His people. When He fixes those dove-like eyes on us, we receive peace, soul-refreshment, cleansing brightness, and the assurance that we are treasured beyond measure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Fitly set</span>.--Literally, <span class= "ital">sitting in fulness, </span>which the Margin explains, according to one received method of interpretation, as beautifully set, like a precious stone in the foil of a ring. If the comparison were to the <span class= "ital">eyes </span>of the dove, this would be a sufficient interpretation, the image being perfect, owing to the ring of bright red skin round the eye of the turtle-dove. But there is no necessity to have recourse to the figure <span class= "ital">comparatio compendiana </span>here, since doves delight in bathing; and though there is a certain delicious haze of indistinctness in the image, the soft iridescence of the bird floating and glancing on the face of the stream might not too extravagantly suggest the quick loving glances of the eye. Keats has a somewhat similar figure:--<p>"To see such lovely eyes in <span class= "ital">swimming search</span><p>After some warm delight, that seems to perch<p><span class= "ital">Dove-like </span>in the dim cell lying beyond<p>Their upper lids;"<p>and Dr. Ginsburg aptly quotes from the <span class= "ital">Gitagovinda: </span>"The glances of her eyes played like a pair of <span class= "ital">water-birds </span>of azure plumage, that sport near a full-grown lotus in <span class= "ital">a pool </span>in the season of dew."
