The walnut grove, or "garden of nuts" in some translations, symbolizes a place of fertility and growth. In biblical times, gardens and groves were often associated with beauty, abundance, and intimacy. The act of going down may also imply humility or a descent into a place of reflection and observation. The walnut tree, known for its strength and longevity, can symbolize wisdom and the richness of God's creation.<p><b>to see the blossoms of the valley</b><br>The valley represents a low-lying area, often fertile and lush, contrasting with the mountains or high places. In biblical literature, valleys can symbolize times of peace and prosperity, as well as places of testing and growth. The blossoms indicate new life and potential, suggesting a time of renewal and hope. This imagery can be connected to the spiritual growth and the blossoming of faith in the believer's life.<p><b>to see if the vines were budding</b><br>Vines are a significant biblical symbol, often representing Israel or the people of God. The budding of vines indicates the beginning of fruitfulness and productivity. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual readiness and the potential for bearing fruit in one's life. In the New Testament, Jesus refers to Himself as the true vine, and believers as the branches, emphasizing the importance of remaining connected to Him for spiritual growth and fruitfulness (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-5</a>).<p><b>or the pomegranates were in bloom</b><br>Pomegranates are frequently mentioned in the Bible as symbols of beauty, fertility, and abundance. They were used in the design of the temple and the priestly garments, signifying holiness and divine blessing. The blooming of pomegranates suggests a time of flourishing and divine favor. In a spiritual sense, this can represent the fullness of life and the blessings that come from a relationship with God. The imagery of blooming pomegranates can also be seen as a type of the abundant life promised by Christ to His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_speaker.htm">The Speaker</a></b><br>Traditionally understood as Solomon or the Shulammite woman, expressing a desire to explore and appreciate the beauty of creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/walnut_grove.htm">Walnut Grove</a></b><br>A place of natural beauty and fertility, symbolizing a setting of growth and potential.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/blossoms_of_the_valley.htm">Blossoms of the Valley</a></b><br>Represents new life and the beauty of creation, often seen as a metaphor for love and spiritual growth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vines_and_pomegranates.htm">Vines and Pomegranates</a></b><br>Symbolic of fertility, abundance, and the blessings of God.

Or ever I was aware, my soul set me among the chariots of my princely people.</span> There cannot he much doubt as to the meaning of these words. Taking them as put into the lips of the bride, and as intended to be a response to the lavish praises of the bridegroom, we may regard them as a modest confession that she had lost her heart immediately that she had seen King Solomon. She went down into her quiet garden life to occupy herself as usual with rustic labours and enjoyments, but the moment that her beloved approached she was carried away - her soul was as in a swift chariot. Delitzsch thinks that the words refer to what occurred after marriage. He supposes that on some occasion the king Look his bride with him on an excursion in his chariot to a plain called Etam. He refers to a description of such a place to be found in Josephus, 'Ant.,' 8:07, 3, but the explanation is far fetched and improbable. The nut or walnut tree (<span class="accented">Juglans regia</span>, Linn.) came originally from Persia. The name is very similar in the Persian, AEthiopic, Arabic, and Syriac. One cannot help comparing the lovely simplicity of the bride's description with the tender beauty of Goethe's 'Herman and Dorothea.' The main point is this, that she is not the mere captive of the king, taken, as was too often the case with Eastern monarchs, by violence into his harem; she was subdued by the power of love. It was love that raised her to the royal chariots of her people. She beholds in King Solomon the concentration and the acme of her people's glory. He is the true Israel; she is the glory of him who is the glory of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/6-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I went down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1428;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;ra&#7695;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3381.htm">Strong's 3381: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come or go down, descend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the walnut</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1490;&#1493;&#1465;&#1494;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;&#7713;&#333;&#183;wz)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_93.htm">Strong's 93: </a> </span><span class="str2">A nut</span><br /><br /><span class="word">grove</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(gin&#183;na&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1594.htm">Strong's 1594: </a> </span><span class="str2">A garden</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to see</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(lir&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
