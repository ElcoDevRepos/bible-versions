In the biblical context, flowers often symbolize beauty and the transient nature of life (<a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>). The countryside, or fields, represents a place of natural beauty and abundance, reflecting God's creation. The appearance of flowers can also be seen as a metaphor for the blossoming of love and the flourishing of relationships, which is a central theme in the Song of Solomon. This imagery may also point to the resurrection and new life found in Christ, as spring follows the death of winter.<p><b>the season of singing has come,</b><br>Singing is often associated with joy and celebration in the Bible. This phrase indicates a time of rejoicing and festivity, aligning with the themes of love and union in the Song of Solomon. In the historical context, singing was a common expression of worship and community celebration (<a href="/psalms/96.htm">Psalm 96:1-2</a>). The "season of singing" can also be seen as a prophetic reference to the joy and worship that will accompany the coming of the Messiah, as well as the eternal joy found in the presence of God (<a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9-10</a>).<p><b>and the cooing of turtledoves is heard in our land.</b><br>Turtledoves are migratory birds that return in the spring, symbolizing peace, love, and fidelity. Their cooing is a gentle, soothing sound that enhances the imagery of tranquility and harmony. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, turtledoves were also used in sacrificial offerings (<a href="/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7</a>), symbolizing purity and devotion. The mention of turtledoves can be seen as a type of Christ, who embodies peace and reconciliation. The "land" refers to the promised land, a place of divine blessing and fulfillment, further emphasizing the themes of love and divine presence in the Song of Solomon.<div class="vheading2">Persons /

The Bridegroom points out what both see with their own eyes&#8212;visible proof that a new season has arrived.<p>&#8226; Relational message: he is saying, &#8220;Everything around us is alive; now is the perfect time for us to enjoy one another.&#8221; The beauty outside mirrors the beauty of their love.<p>&#8226; Spiritual echo: Scripture often uses blossoms to speak of God&#8217;s restoring work&#8212;<a href="/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1</a> promises the wilderness &#8220;will rejoice and blossom like a rose,&#8221; and <a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5-6</a> says God&#8217;s people &#8220;will blossom like the lily.&#8221; Just as winter cannot hold back spring, death and sin cannot hold back the life Christ brings (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the season of singing has come</b><p>&#8226; Nature&#8217;s choir joins the scene; songbirds fill the air.

The external music reflects the internal melody of redeemed hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the cooing of turtledoves is heard in our land</b><p>&#8226; Turtledoves migrate to Israel each spring; their gentle coo announces the change of season. The Bridegroom notes the sound as further proof that winter is gone.<p>&#8226; Symbol of faithful love: doves mate for life, so their call hints at lifelong commitment. That same faithfulness marks the covenant between Christ and His church (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Sacrificial undertone: doves were acceptable offerings for those of humble means (<a href="/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7</a>; <a href="/luke/2-24.htm">Luke 2:24</a>). Hearing them reminds us of the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, &#8220;the Lamb of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Creation&#8217;s witness: <a href="/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a> observes that &#8220;the turtledove, the swallow, and the crane&#8221; know their seasons; if birds recognize God&#8217;s timing, how much more should His people discern the day of visitation and respond in faith (<a href="/luke/19-44.htm">Luke 19:44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/2-12.htm">Song of Solomon 2:12</a> paints a vivid springtime scene to declare that a fresh, joyful, covenant season has arrived.<p>&#8226; Flowers testify to new life and restored beauty.<p>&#8226; Birdsong celebrates love that naturally erupts in praise.<p>&#8226; Turtledoves underscore enduring faithfulness and point to the sacrificial love that makes such joy possible.<p>Taken together, the verse invites us&#8212;literally and spiritually&#8212;to step out of winter, embrace the Bridegroom&#8217;s call, and live in the fullness of the new life He provides.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">The time of the singing</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">zamir&#250;--</span>may mean <span class= "ital">pruning </span>(so LXX. and Vulg.), but parallelism requires <span class= "ital">singing-time </span>(a meaning which analogy will certainly allow us to give to the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">zamir</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Nor can the correctness of our version in inserting <span class= "ital">of birds </span>be questioned, since from the context it is plainly "the untaught harmony of spring," and not the voices of men intended.

"Search the glades and valleys even by sultry Jordan at the end of March, and not a turtle-dove is to be seen.
