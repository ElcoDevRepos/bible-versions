This type of love is central to Christian teachings and is exemplified by Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross. In the context of the early church, love was a binding force that united believers and was a testament to their faith in Christ. The Apostle Paul frequently emphasizes love as a fundamental Christian virtue (1 Corinthians 13, <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>).<p><b>hold them in highest regard</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of respect and honor within the Christian community, particularly towards leaders and those who labor in ministry. The early church was structured with leaders such as elders and deacons who were responsible for teaching, guiding, and caring for the congregation. Paul instructs believers to esteem these individuals highly, recognizing their dedication and service. This respect is not merely for their position but for their commitment to the work of the Gospel (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>).<p><b>because of their work.</b><br>The work referred to here involves the labor of preaching, teaching, and shepherding the flock. In the early church, leaders often faced persecution and hardship, making their work both challenging and vital for the growth and stability of the Christian community. The work of ministry is seen as a calling from God, and those who undertake it are to be supported and encouraged by the congregation (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-12</a>, <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p><b>Live in peace with one another.</b><br>Peace is a recurring theme in Paul's letters and is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>). The call to live in peace reflects the unity that should characterize the body of Christ. In a historical context, the early church faced external pressures from Roman authorities and internal conflicts among believers. Paul urges the Thessalonians to maintain harmony and resolve disputes amicably, reflecting the peace that Christ brings to His followers (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, who is writing to the church in Thessalonica to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.

Love sets both the tone and the motive. Rather than grudging respect, the heart response is warm affection. Jesus made love the badge of discipleship (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>), and Peter urges, &#8220;Above all, love one another deeply&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/4-8.htm">1 Peter 4:8</a>). When affection governs our attitudes, honor becomes a delight instead of a duty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hold them in highest regard</b><p>&#8220;To esteem them very highly&#8221; speaks of a deliberate choice. It&#8217;s not casual appreciation but active, intentional honor. Paul uses similar language when he tells believers to &#8220;give double honor to those who direct the affairs of the church&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>) and to &#8220;honor one another above yourselves&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>). Practical ways include:<p>&#8226; Speaking well of leaders publicly and privately<p>&#8226; Defending them against unfair criticism (<a href="/proverbs/31-8.htm">Proverbs 31:8-9</a>)<p>&#8226; Sharing material support (<a href="/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>)<p>&#8226; Imitating their faith-filled example (<a href="/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because of their work</b><p>The honor is not personality-based; it&#8217;s tied to the God-given task. Pastors and elders &#8220;keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>). They labor in the Word, prayer, and shepherding so the body matures (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-12</a>). Recognizing the weight of that calling stirs gratitude and respectful cooperation. When the flock honors the work, leaders are encouraged, the gospel advances, and Christ is glorified.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Live in peace with one another</b><p>After addressing leaders, Paul turns to the congregation as a whole: &#8220;Live in peace with one another.&#8221; Peace is the atmosphere God desires for His people. Jesus pronounced a blessing on peacemakers (<a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>), and Paul urges, &#8220;If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>). Practical steps include:<p>&#8226; Quick forgiveness (<a href="/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>)<p>&#8226; Gentle speech that turns away wrath (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>)<p>&#8226; Refusal to entertain gossip or division (<a href="/titus/3-10.htm">Titus 3:10</a>)<p>&#8226; Pursuing reconciliation before worship (<a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>)<p>When honor flows upward and peace spreads outward, the church becomes a compelling witness to a watching world (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_thessalonians/5-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:13</a> calls believers to wrap their leaders in heartfelt love, esteem them because of their God-assigned labor, and cultivate peace within the fellowship.
