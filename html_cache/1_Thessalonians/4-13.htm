It reflects the early Christian understanding of the church as a family united in Christ. This familial language emphasizes the bond of love and mutual support that should exist within the Christian community, as seen in other Pauline letters such as <a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a> and <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>.<p><b>we do not want you to be uninformed</b><br>Paul often addresses misunderstandings or lack of knowledge in his epistles. Here, he seeks to correct misconceptions about the fate of deceased believers. This reflects the role of apostles as teachers and guides in the early church, ensuring that doctrine is correctly understood and applied. The importance of sound teaching is echoed in <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>, where Scripture is described as useful for teaching and correcting.<p><b>about those who sleep in death,</b><br>The phrase "sleep in death" is a euphemism for physical death, used to convey the temporary nature of death for believers. This metaphor is consistent with Jewish and early Christian thought, where death is not the end but a state preceding resurrection. Jesus uses similar language in <a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11-14</a> when referring to Lazarus. The concept of sleep implies a future awakening, aligning with the hope of resurrection found in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</a>.<p><b>so that you will not grieve like the rest,</b><br>Paul acknowledges the natural human response to death&#8212;grief&#8212;but contrasts the Christian response with that of non-believers. The grief of believers is tempered by hope, rooted in the promises of God. This distinction is crucial in understanding the Christian worldview, where death is not final. The contrast with "the rest" highlights the transformative impact of faith in Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-13</a>, where believers are described as having hope through Christ.<p><b>who are without hope.</b><br>Hope is a central theme in Christian theology, often associated with the assurance of eternal life and resurrection. In the Greco-Roman world, many viewed death as the end, leading to despair. In contrast, Christian hope is based on the resurrection of Jesus, as affirmed in <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3-4</a>. This hope is not wishful thinking but a confident expectation grounded in the historical reality of Christ's resurrection, which serves as a guarantee of the believer's future resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Thessalonians, providing guidance and encouragement to the early Christian community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the early church was established.

That the soul, or at any rate the <span class= "ital">spirit, </span>still retains consciousness after dissolution is clear from other places; but when the metaphor of sleep is used, it is used of the <span class= "ital">whole</span> man (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/john/11-11.htm" title="These things said he: and after that he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.">John 11:11</a>, "<span class= "ital">Lazarus</span>"--not" Lazarus' body"--"sleepeth"), the explanation being either that stated above--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that the word is simply <span class= "ital">picturesque, </span>describing the peaceful <span class= "ital">appearance</span> of the dead--or that the reference is to <span class= "ital">rest</span> from labour (<a href="/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>). At the same time, the metaphor suggests (otherwise it would be misleading, and St. Paul would not have used it) a continued (even if partly unconscious) existence, and the possibility of a reawakening: Again, for the same reason--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>because the word is metaphorical, not doctrinal--it cannot be limited to the <span class= "ital">Christian</span> dead: when the writers need to mark specially the departed Christians they annex qualifying words, as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1Thessalonians 4:14</a>. Of course, on the mention of "the dead," the Thessalonians will at once think of their own brethren departed, so that there is no ambiguity.<p><span class= "bld">That ye</span> <span class= "bld">sorrow not.</span>--The words express St. Paul's <span class= "ital">object</span> in wishing them to know the truth. He wants them <span class= "ital">not to sorrow at all</span> over the dead; sorrow is only fit for Gentiles who have no hope. He does not mean that they are not to sorrow <span class= "ital">to the same degree</span> as those outside the Church, but that to Christians, who <span class= "ital">have</span> a hope, and such a hope, death ought to have no sorrows. The Office of Burial in the Prayer-book is as joyous as the Eucharistic Office itself. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - With this verse the apostle proceeds to another subject, namely, to comfort those who were mourning the death of their friends. It would appear that the Thessalonians were in perplexity and distress concerning the fate of their deceased friends, fearing that these would miss those blessings which they expected Christ to confer at his advent. Their views of the time and nature of the advent and of the future state in general were confused. They expected that Christ would come immediately and establish his kingdom on earth; and consequently they feared that those who had died would be excluded from it. <span class="cmt_word">But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren</span>; a phrase often used by the apostle, when he makes a transition to new and important matters (comp. <a href="/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Concerning them which are asleep</span>; or, <span class="accented">are fallen asleep.</span> The death of believers in the New Testament is frequently called "sleep." "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth" (<a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11</a>). Of Stephen it is said that "he fell asleep" (<a href="/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>). "Many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep" (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>). "Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-18.htm">1 Corinthians 15:18</a>). "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed" (l Corinthians 15:51). "He fell asleep" is a common epitaph on early Christian tombstones. It is to be observed that it is not of the dead generally that the apostle speaks, but of the dead in Christ, and especially of those members of the Thessalonian Church who had died. <span class="cmt_word">That ye sorrow not.</span> Some suppose that sorrow for our deceased friends is here utterly prohibited; inasmuch as if we had a firm belief in their blessedness we would rejoice and not mourn. But the sorrow here prohibited is a despairing and an unbelieving sorrow; we are forbidden to sorrow as those who have no hope, no belief in a blessed resurrection. The tears of Jesus at the tomb of Lazarus have authorized and sanctified Christian sorrow. "Paul," observes Calvin, "lifts up the minds of believers to a consideration of the resurrection, lest they should indulge excessive grief on occasion of the death of their relatives, for it were unseemly that there should be no difference between them and unbelievers, who put no end or measure to their grief, for this reason, that in death they recognize nothing but destruction. Those that abuse this testimony so as to establish among Christians stoical indifference, that is, an iron hardness, will find nothing of this nature in Paul's words." <span class="cmt_word">Even as others</span>; literally, as <span class="accented">the rest</span>; namely, the heathen. <span class="cmt_word">Which have no hope</span>; no hope of immortality beyond death, or no hope of the resurrection. The heathen, with very few exceptions, had no hope of a future life, and hence they mourned over the death of their friends as an irreparable loss. This disconsolate feeling is apparent in their writings (for examples, see Lunemann, Alford, and Jowett, <span class="accented">in loco</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Brothers,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(adelphoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_80.htm">Strong's 80: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brother, member of the same religious community, especially a fellow-Christian.
