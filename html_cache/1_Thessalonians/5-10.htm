The death of Christ is seen as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. The concept of substitutionary atonement is highlighted here, where Jesus died in place of sinners, bearing the punishment for sin. This act of love and sacrifice is foundational to the Christian faith, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> and <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>, where God's love is demonstrated through Christ's death.<p><b>so that, whether we are awake or asleep</b><br>The terms "awake" and "asleep" are often interpreted in two ways: spiritually and physically. Spiritually, "awake" refers to being alive in Christ, living a life of faith and obedience, while "asleep" can refer to spiritual lethargy or death. Physically, "awake" refers to those who are alive, and "asleep" to those who have died. This dual interpretation is consistent with Paul's teachings in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-18</a>, where he comforts believers about those who have "fallen asleep" in death, assuring them of the resurrection.<p><b>we may live together with Him</b><br>This phrase speaks to the hope of eternal life and union with Christ. The promise of living with Christ is a central theme in the New Testament, reflecting the believer's ultimate destiny. In <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>, Jesus promises to prepare a place for His followers, ensuring they will be with Him. This assurance of eternal life is a source of comfort and motivation for believers, encouraging them to persevere in faith. The concept of living with Christ also reflects the intimate relationship between the believer and the Savior, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, where Paul speaks of Christ living in him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Thessalonians, providing guidance and encouragement to the early Christian community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.

What a blessed privilege a Christian's life of labour must be, if it alone--to say nothing of the "salvation" at the end--cost such a price!<p><span class= "bld">Whether we wake or sleep.</span>--The mention of Christ's death at once brings back the recollection of the Advent and the questions concerning the dead in their relation to it. The words "wake or sleep" seem distinctly suggested by the metaphor used <span class= "ital">from </span><a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2</a> <span class= "ital">to </span><a href="/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm" title="But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.">1Thessalonians 5:8</a>, being different in the Greek from the terms used in 1 Thessalonians 4, but abruptly take a much altered meaning. They here, no doubt, signify "life and death:"--"Let us arm ourselves with a brave hope of our salvation, for it will be against God's will if we should perish: He means us to save ourselves by union with Him who put an end to death for us by dying, and made all who wait for His coming to <span class= "ital">live, </span>whether they be in the world's sense dead or alive."<p><span class= "bld">We should live.</span>--In sharp contrast with "who died for us." Christ's dying destroyed the power of death (<a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>); henceforth it is only a matter of being awake or asleep; those who sleep quite as truly live, and live with Him, as we who wake (see <a href="/luke/20-38.htm" title="For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.">Luke 20:38</a>; and compare the more developed passage in <a href="/romans/14-8.htm" title="For whether we live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die to the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.">Romans 14:8</a>). The word "together" (as the Greek clearly shows) must be separated from the "with;" rather, "we should live with Him together," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>we quick, and our brethren the dead; for St. Paul has entirely reverted from the <span class= "ital">effect</span> of the Advent-doctrine upon Christian life to the subject of the last chapter--the equality of the two classes at Christ's coming. Bengel, thinking that St. Paul is still applying himself to the discussion of the <span class= "ital">date</span> of the Advent (which in fact was scarcely raised), tries to make out the meaning, "That we should <span class= "ital">there and then</span> live with Him." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who died</span>.

The apostle has just been speaking of those who are dead under the designation of those "who are asleep" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>), and therefore it is natural to interpret the clause, "whether we wake or sleep," of the condition of believers at the coming of the Lord. There is here certainly a change of metaphor: "sleep" in ver. 6 denotes religious carelessness; in ver. 7, natural sleep; and here, death. <span class="cmt_word">We shall live together</span> - or, in <span class="accented">one company - <span class="cmt_word"></span>with him.</span> The apostle is still continuing his consolatory address to those who were mourning over their deceased friends; and he tells them that at the advent there will be no difference between those who are then alive and those who sleep - both will live together with the Lord (comp. <a href="/romans/14-8.htm">Romans 14:8, 9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/5-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(tou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
