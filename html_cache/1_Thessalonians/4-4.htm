In the context of the early church, believers were encouraged to grow in their understanding and application of God's will. The use of "must know" suggests a deliberate and conscious effort to learn and apply biblical principles. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of wisdom and knowledge, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.<p><b>how to control his own body</b><br>The call to control one's body reflects the biblical teaching on self-discipline and purity. In the Greco-Roman world, where sexual immorality was prevalent, this instruction was counter-cultural. The body is seen as a temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>), and believers are urged to honor God with their bodies. This control is not merely physical but involves the mind and spirit, aligning with the fruit of the Spirit, which includes self-control (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).<p><b>in holiness</b><br>Holiness is a central theme in Scripture, reflecting God's nature and His call for His people to be set apart. In the Old Testament, holiness was often associated with ritual purity and the sacrificial system. In the New Testament, it takes on a moral and ethical dimension, calling believers to live lives that reflect God's character. This aligns with <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>, which calls Christians to be holy in all their conduct, as God is holy.<p><b>and honor</b><br>Honor in this context refers to the respect and dignity that should characterize a believer's life. It involves treating others with respect and living in a way that brings glory to God. In the cultural context of the Thessalonians, honor was a significant social value, and Paul is urging believers to live in a way that upholds their testimony before others. This is consistent with <a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>, which encourages believers to think on things that are honorable and praiseworthy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Thessalonians, providing guidance and encouragement to the early Christian community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the church was established by Paul during his second missionary journey.

The Bulgarian Father, Theophylact, says pointedly in reference to the word "to know" or "understand," "He indicates that chastity is a matter that requires self-discipline and study." (Comp. <a href="/ephesians/5-17.htm" title="Why be you not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.">Ephesians 5:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To possess his vessel.</span>--The word rendered "to possess" should rather be translated, <span class= "ital">to procure, win, gain possession of.</span> The word "vessel" here has been interpreted in two ways: (1) "his wife;" (2) "his body." In favour of (1) it is argued that (while "gaining possession of one's own body" is unintelligible), "acquiring a wife of one's own" is an ordinary Greek expression; that in this context, "a vessel," or "instrument," is an expressive and natural metaphor; that the word was familiar to Hebrew speakers in that sense (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Ahasuerus says of Vashti, in one of the Targums, "My vessel which I use is neither Median nor Persian, but Chaldee"); that St. Peter (<a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm" title="Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.">1Peter 3:7</a>) uses the word of the wife. But it may be answered that this interpretation does not suit our context; first, because it would be laying an emphatic and binding veto upon celibacy, if "each one" is "to acquire a wife of his own;" secondly, because of the verb "to know," it certainly being no part of a religious man's duty "to <span class= "ital">know how</span> to procure a wife;" thirdly, because the Greek cannot be translated "<span class= "ital">a</span> vessel (or <span class= "ital">wife</span>) of his own," but "<span class= "ital">his own</span> vessel" (or <span class= "ital">wife</span>)--literally, <span class= "ital">the vessel of himself</span>--and to speak of "procuring" the wife who is already one's own seems unmeaning. Furthermore, although the quotations from the Targums are certainly to the point, that from St. Peter distinctly points the other way, inasmuch as the wife is called "the weaker vessel of the two," evidently meaning that the husband is also "a vessel." Thus we are driven to suppose that (2) the "vessel" is the man's own self. This usage also is well supported. In <a href="/1_samuel/21-5.htm" title="And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yes, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.">1Samuel 21:5</a>, it is used in precisely this sense, and in the same context, as well as in <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm" title="Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.">1Peter 3:7</a>. The passages, however, usually quoted in support of this interpretation from <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.">2Corinthians 4:7</a>, Philo, Barnabas, Lucretius, &c, do not seem quite parallel; for there the word signifies a "vessel," in the sense of a receptacle for <span class= "ital">containing</span> something; here it is rather "an instrument" or "implement "for <span class= "ital">doing</span> something. Hence it approaches more nearly to the use in such phrases as <a href="/acts/9-15.htm" title="But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:">Acts 9:15</a>, "a vessel of choice," or even (though the Greek word is different) to <a href="/romans/6-13.htm" title="Neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin: but yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.">Romans 6:13</a>. "The vessel of himself" (the "himself" being in the Greek strongly emphasised) means, not "the vessel which is his own," but "the vessel or instrument which consists of himself." Thus the body, which of course is chiefly meant here, is not dissociated from the man's personality, as in the fanciful Platonism of Philo, but almost identified with it: the Incarnation has taught us the true dignity of the body. Thus it becomes easy to understand what is meant by "knowing how to gain possession of" such an instrument as the body with its many faculties, rescuing it from its vile prostitution, and wielding it wisely for its proper uses. So the same Greek verb is used, and mistranslated in our version, in <a href="/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>, "In your patience possess ye your souls." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That every one of you should know how to possess.</span> The word here rendered "possess" rather signifies "acquire." The R.V. renders the clause, "that each one of you know how to possess himself of;" hence it admits of the translation, "to obtain the mastery over." <span class="cmt_word">His vessel.</span> This word has given rise to a diversity of interpretation. Especially two meanings have been given to it. By some it is supposed to be a figurative expression for "wife," in which sense the word is used, though rarely, by Hebrew writers. Peter speaks of the wife "as the weaker vessel" (<a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). This is the meaning adopted by Augustine, Schott, Do Wette, Koch, Hofmann, L&uuml;nemann, Riggenbach; and, among English expositors, by Alford, Jowett, Ellicott, and Eadie. This meaning is, however, to be rejected as unusual and strange, and unsuitable to what follows in the next verse. The other meaning - "one's own body" - is more appropriate. Thus Paul says, "We have this treasure," namely, the gospel, "in earthen vessels" (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>; comp. also <a href="/1_samuel/21-5.htm">1 Samuel 21:5</a>). The body may well be compared to a vessel, as it contains the soul. This meaning is adopted by Chrysostom, Calvin, Grotius, Bengel, Olshausen, Meyer; and, among English expositors, by Macknight, Conybeare, Bishop Alexander, Wordsworth, and Yaughan. <span class="cmt_word">In sanctification and honor.</span> What the apostle here requires is that every one should obtain the mastery over his own body, and that whereas, as Gentiles, they had yielded their members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, they should now, as Christians, yield their members servants to righteousness unto holiness (<a href="/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">each</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7957;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hekaston)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1538.htm">Strong's 1538: </a> </span><span class="str2">Each (of more than two), every one.
