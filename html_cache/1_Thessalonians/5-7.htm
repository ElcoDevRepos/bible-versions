In biblical context, sleep often symbolizes a lack of vigilance or preparedness, as seen in the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>). Night, in this context, represents a time of darkness and moral ambiguity, contrasting with the light of day, which symbolizes truth and righteousness (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>). The cultural understanding of night as a time for rest and inactivity underscores the idea of spiritual complacency. This metaphor encourages believers to remain spiritually awake and alert, as Paul emphasizes earlier in the chapter (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>).<p><b>and those who get drunk, get drunk at night</b><br>Drunkenness is used here as a metaphor for moral and spiritual carelessness. In the ancient world, as today, night was often associated with revelry and indulgence, activities that are typically hidden from the scrutiny of daylight. This reflects a broader biblical theme where darkness is associated with sin and separation from God (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>). The call is for believers to live as children of the light, avoiding behaviors that lead to spiritual dullness and moral compromise (<a href="/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12-13</a>). The contrast between night and day serves as a reminder of the transformative power of Christ, who calls His followers to live in the light of His truth and righteousness (1 <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Thessalonians, providing guidance and encouragement to the early Christian community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the early church was established.

Sleep and drunkenness belong to night. Watchfulness and sobriety belong to day.

It may thus be paraphrased: "I say, 'and be sober too,' for as they that sleep in the night, so they that be drunken are drunken in the night." It is implied that the streets <span class= "ital">even</span> of heathen Thessalonica were seldom affronted with the common English spectacle of drunken men by daylight; while among the Jews it was proof positive of sobriety to say, "It is but the third hour of the day" (<a href="/acts/2-15.htm" title="For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.">Acts 2:15</a>). In St. Cyprian's time, Christians were known from other men because their breath smelt of wine in the early morning through attending the Blessed Sacrament (<span class= "ital">Epistle</span> lxiii. 15): no heathens would have touched wine by that time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>; the reason of this exhortation. <span class="cmt_word">They that sleep, sleep in the night</span>; <span class="cmt_word">and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.</span> Here not to be taken in a metaphorical sense, but a simple statement of fact - what occurs in ordinary experience. The night is the season in which sleep and drunkenness usually occur; whereas the day is the season of watchfulness, sobriety, and work. Both heathen and Jews considered it as eminently disgraceful for a man to be seen drunken in the day-time. Hence, when the Jews accused the believers on the day of Pentecost with being filled with new wine, Peter answered, "We are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day" (<a href="/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
