This phrase emphasizes the transparency and integrity of Paul's ministry. The Thessalonians were firsthand witnesses to Paul's behavior, which underscores the authenticity of his message and actions. This appeal to personal knowledge is a common rhetorical device in Paul's letters, reinforcing the trustworthiness of his testimony.<p><b>we never used words of flattery</b><br>Flattery involves insincere praise, often used to manipulate or gain favor. In the Greco-Roman world, itinerant philosophers and speakers were known for using flattery to win over audiences and gain followers. Paul contrasts his approach with these practices, highlighting his commitment to truth and sincerity. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/26-28.htm">Proverbs 26:28</a>, which warns against the dangers of flattery, and reflects the biblical call to speak truthfully (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>).<p><b>or any pretext for greed.</b><br>Paul denies using his ministry as a cover for personal gain. In the ancient world, some religious leaders exploited their positions for financial benefit. Paul distinguishes himself from such individuals, emphasizing his selflessness and dedication to the gospel. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a> about serving God rather than money, and Paul's own example of working to support himself (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>).<p><b>God is our witness!</b><br>Paul invokes God as a witness to his integrity, underscoring the seriousness of his claim. This appeal to divine witness is a solemn affirmation, reflecting the biblical understanding that God knows the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). It also serves as a reminder of the ultimate accountability to God, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).

Paul flatly denies using it. <a href="/proverbs/26-28.htm">Proverbs 26:28</a> warns, &#8220;A lying tongue hates those it crushes, and a flattering mouth works ruin.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2-3</a> adds, &#8220;They speak falsehood to one another; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.&#8221; By refusing flattery:<p>&#8226; Paul keeps the message focused on Christ, not on stroking egos.<p>&#8226; He avoids creating followers of himself rather than disciples of Jesus (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; He models genuine love, which &#8220;does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-6.htm">1 Corinthians 13:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or any pretext for greed</b><p>Greed dresses itself up in religious clothing when it can.

When these qualities shape our witness, the gospel shines without distortion, and Christ alone receives the glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">At any time.</span>--Not only during the stay at Thessalonica, but neither at Thessalonica nor elsewhere, as the next verse shows.

Paul could with perfect confidence appeal to his converts, and say, "I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel" (<a href="/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33</a>). He was free from all sinister motives. "He did not use words such as flattery uses, or pretexts such as covetousness" (Jowett). <span class="cmt_word">God is witness.</span> Paul appeals to the Thessalonians themselves that he had not used flattering words; so now he appeals to God that the motive of his conduct was not covetousness. Men can judge the external conduct, they can hear the flattering words; but God only can know the motive of action - he only can discern the covetousness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kath&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2531.htm">Strong's 2531: </a> </span><span class="str2">According to the manner in which, in the degree that, just as, as.
