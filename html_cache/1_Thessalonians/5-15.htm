The concept of not repaying evil for evil is rooted in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/proverbs/20-22.htm">Proverbs 20:22</a>, which advises against seeking revenge. In the cultural context of the Greco-Roman world, where honor and retribution were highly valued, this teaching would have been countercultural and challenging. The early Christian community was called to reflect Christ's example, who did not retaliate when wronged (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>). This principle is also a reflection of God's justice, trusting that He will ultimately right all wrongs (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p><b>Always pursue what is good for one another and for all people.</b><br>This phrase calls believers to actively seek the welfare of others, both within the Christian community and beyond. The Greek word for "pursue" implies a continuous and intentional effort, suggesting that doing good is not passive but requires deliberate action. This aligns with the broader biblical mandate to love one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>; <a href="/mark/12-31.htm">Mark 12:31</a>) and to do good to all, especially to those who belong to the family of believers (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>). The call to pursue good for "all people" underscores the universal scope of Christian love and service, transcending ethnic, social, and religious boundaries. This reflects the inclusive nature of the Gospel and the mission of the Church to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and epistles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where Paul established a church.

This pursuit requires intentionality and often self-sacrifice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_witness.htm">Community and Witness</a></b><br>The call to pursue good for one another within the church strengthens community bonds and serves as a powerful witness to the world of the unity and love found in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_good.htm">Understanding Good</a></b><br>The Greek word for "good" (agathos) implies moral excellence and beneficial actions.

Because Scripture is literally true and authoritative, this is not merely advice; it is God&#8217;s requirement for His people (<a href="/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17-19</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38-39</a>).<p>- &#8220;No one&#8221; removes loopholes. Every believer, regardless of personality or circumstance, is called to resist retaliation (<a href="/1_peter/3-9.htm">1 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>- The verb tense points to ongoing vigilance. We actively watch our own hearts and help fellow believers resist revenge, knowing vengeance belongs to the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-22.htm">Proverbs 20:22</a>).<p>- When evil is done to us, we are to absorb the wrong without striking back. Jesus modeled this perfectly at the cross (<a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Always pursue what is good</b><p>- &#8220;Always&#8221; sets a never-ending timeline; pursuing good is our lifestyle, not a one-time choice (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9-10</a>).<p>- &#8220;Pursue&#8221; signals energetic effort. Goodness rarely happens by accident; we chase it with intention, prayer, and practical steps (<a href="/psalms/34-14.htm">Psalm 34:14</a>).<p>- &#8220;What is good&#8221; refers to whatever aligns with God&#8217;s character&#8212;truth, mercy, purity, justice (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; We resist the pull of selfishness by planning positive actions ahead of time.<p>&#8226; We replace revenge fantasies with concrete deeds of kindness (<a href="/luke/6-27.htm">Luke 6:27-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For one another and for all people</b><p>- The circle starts with the church family (&#8220;one another&#8221;) and widens to include everyone we meet (&#8220;all people&#8221;).
