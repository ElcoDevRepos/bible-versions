The "message of the Lord" refers to the gospel of Jesus Christ, which the Thessalonians embraced and actively shared. Macedonia and Achaia were significant regions in ancient Greece, with Macedonia to the north and Achaia to the south. This indicates the widespread influence of the Thessalonian believers. The phrase "ring out" suggests a powerful and resonant proclamation, akin to a trumpet sound, emphasizing the clarity and strength of their witness. This echoes the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His followers to spread the gospel to all nations.<p><b>but your faith in God has gone out to every place</b><br>The Thessalonians' faith was not confined to their immediate surroundings but was known "to every place," suggesting a far-reaching impact. This phrase highlights the early church's role in spreading Christianity across the Roman Empire. Their faith was not just a private belief but a public testimony that inspired others. This aligns with the idea in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where believers are called to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth." The Thessalonians' example serves as a model for how faith can transcend geographical boundaries and cultural barriers.<p><b>so that we have no need to say anything more</b><br>Paul, Silas, and Timothy, who were instrumental in founding the Thessalonian church, found that the believers' actions spoke louder than any further words they could offer. This statement underscores the effectiveness of the Thessalonians' witness. Their reputation for faith and evangelism was so well-established that it rendered additional commendation unnecessary. This reflects the principle found in <a href="/james/2-18.htm">James 2:18</a>, where faith is demonstrated through actions. The Thessalonians' lives were a testament to the transformative power of the gospel, fulfilling the call to be "the light of the world" (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonians.htm">Thessalonians</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, the believers in Thessalonica, a city in Macedonia.

God still calls believers to the same contagious witness&#8212;letting the message of the Lord ring out and allowing a faith lived out to speak for itself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">For.</span>--"For, in fact," (supporting and exceeding the statement of <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-7.htm" title="So that you were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.">1Thessalonians 1:7</a> about Greece) "you form the centre from which the doctrine of Christ has rung (not <span class= "ital">rang</span>) out like a trumpet through those countries; and even beyond, your faith is well known." The clauses are not quite logically balanced.<p><span class= "bld">Your faith</span> does not mean "your creed," but "the report of your extraordinary faith."<p><span class= "bld">To say anything</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, about our success at Thessalonica.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>; or, <span class="accented">because</span> the proof of tiffs praise conferred on the Thessalonians. <span class="cmt_word">From you sounded out.</span> Resounded like the sound of a trumpet. Comp. <a href="/romans/10-18.htm">Romans 10:18</a>, "Their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the end of the world." <span class="cmt_word">The word of the Lord.</span> This does not intimate that the Thessalonians by their missionary activity disseminated the gospel, but that from them locally the-gospel had spread. <span class="cmt_word">Not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad.</span> There is a slight difficulty in the construction. The sentence is complete without the addition, "your faith to God-ward is spread abroad," and, therefore, we must consider these words as equivalent to "<span class="accented">from</span> you sounded out the word of the Lord." When the apostle says that "<span class="accented">the</span> faith of the Thessalonians is spread abroad in every place," the meaning is that the report of their joyful reception of the gospel had excited universal attention. There is here a certain use of the figure hyperbole. The words, "in every place," are not to be taken in their full literal sense, but are merely a strong expression for the wide diffusion of the faith of the Thessalonians. Paul uses similar hyperboles in other places, as when he speaks of the faith of the Romans being spoken of throughout the whole world (<a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>), and of the gospel having come into all the world (<a href="/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>). This wide diffusion of the Faith of the Thessalonians, notwithstanding the recent date of their conversion, may be accounted for when we consider that Thessalonica and Corinth were two great commercial cities, from and to which there was a constant coming and going, so that reports might easily be transmitted by merchants and strangers. It has also been suggested that Aquila and Priscilla, who had lately come from Rome (<a href="/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2</a>), must in their journey have passed through Thessalonica, and would bring with them to Corinth such a report of the faith of the Thessalonians (Wieseler). <span class="cmt_word">So that we need not to speak anything</span>; that is, of your faith, as this is already so well known and applauded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
