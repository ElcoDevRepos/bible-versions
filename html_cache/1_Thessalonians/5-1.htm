The "times and seasons" are often associated with God's divine plan and timing, which are beyond human understanding. In <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>, Jesus tells His disciples that it is not for them to know the times or dates the Father has set by His own authority. This indicates that while believers are to be aware and watchful, the specific timing of these events remains a mystery.<p><b>brothers</b><br>The term "brothers" is used to address fellow believers, indicating a familial relationship within the body of Christ. This reflects the early Christian community's sense of unity and shared faith. The use of "brothers" underscores the importance of mutual encouragement and support as they await Christ's return. It also highlights the inclusivity of the early church, where all believers, regardless of background, are considered part of God's family.<p><b>we do not need to write to you</b><br>This suggests that the Thessalonians were already well-informed about the teachings concerning the end times. Paul had previously instructed them on these matters, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-18</a>, where he discusses the coming of the Lord. The phrase implies that the Thessalonians had a good understanding of the eschatological teachings, possibly due to Paul's earlier visit and teachings. It also reflects the confidence Paul had in their knowledge and readiness, emphasizing the importance of being prepared and living in a manner that reflects anticipation of Christ's return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Thessalonians, providing guidance and encouragement to the early Christian community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the church was established by Paul during his second missionary journey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonian_believers.htm">Thessalonian Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christians facing persecution and needing reassurance about the return of Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/times_and_seasons.htm">Times and Seasons</a></b><br>Refers to the periods and events related to the return of Christ and the fulfillment of God's plan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_the_lord.htm">Day of the Lord</a></b><br>An eschatological event anticipated by the early church, involving the return of Christ and the final judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God alone controls the times and seasons, and trust in His perfect plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_readiness.htm">Living in Readiness</a></b><br>Focus on living a life that is pleasing to God, being prepared for Christ's return at any moment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_speculation.htm">Avoiding Speculation</a></b><br>Resist the temptation to predict or speculate about the end times, and instead, concentrate on spiritual growth and evangelism.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_persecution.htm">Encouragement in Persecution</a></b><br>Find comfort in the assurance of Christ's return, especially during times of trial and persecution.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_accountability.htm">Community and Accountability</a></b><br>Engage with fellow believers in mutual encouragement and accountability, fostering a community that eagerly awaits the Lord's return.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Thessalonians_5_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Thessalonians 5:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Thess_5_1_s_call_for_readiness.htm">How does 1 Thessalonians 5:1 encourage readiness for the "times and seasons"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_times_and_seasons_for_Christ_s_return.htm">What does "times and seasons" mean in the context of Christ's return?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Live_daily_for_the_Lord_s_return.htm">How can we live daily in anticipation of the Lord's return?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Contrast_1_Thess_5_1_Matt_24_36_timing.htm">Compare 1 Thessalonians 5:1 with Matthew 24:36 on knowing the time.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Christ_s_return_on_priorities.htm">How should the uncertainty of Christ's return impact our spiritual priorities today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Thess_5_1_on_end_times_timing.htm">What does 1 Thessalonians 5:1 imply about predicting the timing of the end times?

Jesus told the apostles, &#8220;It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by His own authority&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>). Yet Scripture repeatedly affirms that God has set definite prophetic markers (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>; <a href="/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase signals a shift from the comforting details of the rapture (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-18</a>) to the sobering theme of the Day of the Lord (5:2).<p>&#8226; By using both &#8220;times&#8221; (chronos&#8212;lengthy periods) and &#8220;seasons&#8221; (kairos&#8212;critical moments), Paul assures believers that every span and every decisive point in God&#8217;s plan is fully known and controlled by Him (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The practical takeaway: live watchfully and responsibly because God&#8217;s calendar is advancing even when we cannot pinpoint dates (<a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42-44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>brothers</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;brothers&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Paul addresses the church family with affectionate equality. All believers share the same Father through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; This reminder of spiritual kinship creates a safe setting for discussing eschatology: it is family truth shared among siblings, not secret knowledge for an elite few (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The term also cues mutual responsibility; what follows is meant for mutual encouragement and accountability (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we do not need to write to you</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;we do not need to write to you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Paul had already taught them about end-time events during his brief stay (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:5</a>; <a href="/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2-3</a>). Their knowledge was sufficient; what they needed was reinforcement, not new revelation.<p>&#8226; This line illustrates the effectiveness of prior discipleship. Genuine instruction sticks, enabling believers to stand firm even under persecution (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>; 3:3-4).<p>&#8226; It also affirms that Scripture is clear on essentials; when God has spoken plainly, repetition serves to strengthen rather than to supplement (<a href="/2_peter/1-12.htm">2 Peter 1:12-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Finally, the statement challenges modern readers: are we living in the light we already possess, or merely collecting more data (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>)?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s single verse reassures believers that God&#8217;s prophetic schedule is fixed, familial, and familiar. The Father oversees every era and exact moment; we, as brothers and sisters, already possess sufficient truth to live alert, hopeful, and obedient while we await the Day of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>V.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">But of the times.</span>--The fourth subject of instruction; the bearing of the doctrine of the Advent upon the Christian's own life. "Times and seasons" is a Hebraism, and in the original, the <span class= "ital">second</span> word, not the first, is the more explicit: we should say, "About day and hour." The plural seems to mean the different periods at which men might conceive the Advent likely to come.<p><span class= "bld">Ye have no need.</span>--The next verse shows that this paragraph is not so much intended for an answer to a false theory about the time of the Advent, as practically to cure the restlessness common at Thessalonica.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - This verse is connected with what precedes. The apostle was comforting the Thessalonians under the loss of their deceased friends by the assurance that both the living and the dead would be gathered together at the advent. The question would naturally arise, "When shall these things be?" (<a href="/luke/21-7.htm">Luke 21:7</a>); and it would appear that the Thessalonians expected an immediate advent. The apostle represses their curiosity on this point by reminding them of the uncertainty of the time of the Lord's coming. <span class="cmt_word">But of the times and the seasons, brethren</span>; that is, of the time and the precise period of the Lord's advent. "Times" and "seasons" are elsewhere united together (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>; <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>). The word translated "times" denotes time absolutely without regard to circumstances; and the word rendered "seasons" denotes a definite point of time; not merely the day, but the hour (<a href="/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye have no need that I write unto you</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that ought be written unto you</span> (R.V.); comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>. The reason why it was not needful for the apostle to write unto them was, not because he regarded the information unprofitable or superfluous, or because he knew it to be impossible, but because he had already informed them when at Thessalonica that the time of the advent was beyond the sphere of his teaching. The apostle mentions this to repress that vain curiosity which is natural to man, and which was the occasion of so much disorder among the Thessalonians. Our duty is, not to pry into the times and seasons which the Father hath put in his own power (<a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>), but to exercise constant watchfulness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">about</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Peri)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4012.htm">Strong's 4012: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of peran; properly, through, i.e. Around; figuratively with respect to; used in various applications, of place, cause or time.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
