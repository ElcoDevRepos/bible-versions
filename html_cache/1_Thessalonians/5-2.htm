This phrase indicates that the knowledge of this event was not new to them. It suggests a level of spiritual maturity and understanding among the believers. The early church was often reminded of the teachings of Jesus and the apostles, emphasizing the importance of being prepared and vigilant.<p><b>that the Day of the Lord</b><br>The "Day of the Lord" is a significant biblical concept referring to a future time when God will intervene decisively in human history. It is often associated with judgment and the establishment of God's kingdom. In the Old Testament, prophets like Joel and Amos spoke of this day as one of both judgment and salvation. In the New Testament, it is linked to the second coming of Christ and the final judgment. This day is anticipated with both hope and reverence by believers.<p><b>will come like a thief in the night.</b><br>This metaphor highlights the unexpected and sudden nature of the Day of the Lord. Just as a thief comes without warning, so will this day arrive without prior notice. Jesus used similar language in the Gospels (<a href="/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43-44</a>, <a href="/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39-40</a>) to emphasize the need for constant readiness and vigilance. The imagery of a thief underscores the element of surprise and the importance of being spiritually prepared at all times.

Scripture ties it to judgment on the wicked and deliverance for the faithful.<p>&#8226; Isaiah declared, &#8220;Behold, the Day of the LORD is coming&#8212;cruel, with fury and burning anger&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter connected it to final judgment: &#8220;The Day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Joel looked ahead to cosmic signs and repentance (<a href="/joel/2-30.htm">Joel 2:30&#8211;32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will come</b><p>The verb underscores certainty.

"I need not tell you about the time, for you know to a nicety--not the hour of Christ's coming, but--the utter uncertainty respecting it." The word shows at the same time with what scrupulous care St. Paul had instructed them on this topic.<p><span class= "bld">The day of the Lord.</span>--Here "the Lord" (as usual in the New Testament) means Jesus Christ; and this day can mean nothing else than the great day of His return to judgment. The expression is taken from the Old Testament, where, of course, it does not primarily mean what we call "the Day of Judgment," but the set time which God has fixed for any great visitation. Thus in <a href="/joel/2-1.htm" title="Blow you the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD comes, for it is near at hand;">Joel 2:1</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq., </span>it means the time appointed for the plague of locusts; in <a href="/ezekiel/13-5.htm" title="You have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.">Ezekiel 13:5</a>, generally, any day when God visits His people; in <a href="/joel/3-14.htm" title="Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.">Joel 3:14</a>, the fixed time for vengeance to be taken upon the heathen for persecuting the Church; which, in <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm" title="For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be on every one that is proud and lofty, and on every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:">Isaiah 2:12</a> (a passage largely influenced by recollections of Joel), seems to widen into a general day of judgment for mankind. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For yourselves know perfectly</span>; namely, not from Scripture, nor from oral tradition, but from the teaching of the apostle when in Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">That the day of the Lord</span>. "The day of the Lord" is a common Old Testament expression, denoting the coming of the Divine judgments (<a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>); and by the phrase here is meant, not the destruction of Jerusalem, nor the day of one's death, but the day of the Lord's advent, when Christ shall descend from heaven in glory for the resurrection of the dead and the judgment of the world. The idea of judgment is contained in the term "day." <span class="cmt_word">So cometh as a thief in the night</span>. The same comparison is used by our Lord himself (<a href="/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a>), and the very words are employed by Peter (<a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>). The point of resemblance is evidently the unexpectedness and suddenness of the coming. The thief comes upon people in the night season, when they are asleep and unprepared; so, in a similar manner, when Christ comes, he will find the world unprepared and not expecting his advent. The ancient Fathers inferred from this passage that Christ would come to judgment in the night season, and hence they instituted vigils, or night watches. Some, still more precisely, fixed the coming on Easter night, from the analogy of the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt on the paschal evening. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
