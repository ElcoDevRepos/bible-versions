The depth of care is reminiscent of a shepherd's love for his flock, as seen in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus describes Himself as the Good Shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep. This care is not superficial but rooted in genuine love and concern for their spiritual well-being.<p><b>that we were delighted to share with you</b><br>Paul's delight in sharing with the Thessalonians underscores the joy found in ministry and fellowship. This mirrors the joy expressed in <a href="/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>, where it is said that it is more blessed to give than to receive. The sharing here is not out of obligation but out of a heartfelt desire to impart something valuable.<p><b>not only the gospel of God</b><br>The gospel of God refers to the good news of Jesus Christ, His death, and resurrection for the salvation of mankind. This is the central message of Christianity, as highlighted in <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, where Paul declares he is not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God for salvation. The emphasis on "not only" suggests that while the gospel is paramount, there is more to their relationship.<p><b>but our own lives as well</b><br>Paul and his companions were willing to invest personally in the Thessalonians, sharing their lives and experiences. This reflects the model of discipleship seen in Jesus' ministry, where He lived among His disciples, teaching and guiding them daily. It emphasizes the importance of relational ministry, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>, where early Christians shared life together.<p><b>That is how beloved you have become to us.</b><br>The Thessalonians' beloved status indicates a deep bond formed through shared experiences and mutual faith. This echoes the love described in 1 <a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7-8</a>, where believers are called to love one another because love is from God.

The word here rendered "souls" denotes lives; and the meaning is that the apostle was willing to submit to death for the sake of the Thessalonians. The plural "we" still implies Paul and Silas and Timothy. The thought is - As a nursing mother not only nourishes tier children, but is also ready to sacrifice her life for them; so the apostle not only nourished his spiritual children with the pure milk of the gospel, but was ready to sacrifice his own life for their spiritual maintenance; thus expressing in the strongest manner the womanly tenderness of the apostle toward his converts. <span class="cmt_word">Because ye were dear unto us.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We cared so deeply</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;&#956;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(homeiromenoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2442.htm">Strong's 2442: </a> </span><span class="str2">To desire earnestly, long for; I have a strong affection for, love fervently.
