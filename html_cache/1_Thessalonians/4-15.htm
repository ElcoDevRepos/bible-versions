It suggests that the teaching is not based on human wisdom but is a revelation from God. This aligns with other instances in Scripture where prophets and apostles speak with divine authority, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a> and <a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-12</a>. The phrase underscores the importance of divine revelation in understanding eschatological events.<p><b>we declare to you</b><br>The use of "we" indicates the collective authority of Paul and his companions, Silas and Timothy, as they communicate this message to the Thessalonian church. This reflects the communal nature of early Christian teaching and the role of apostolic authority in the early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22-29</a>.<p><b>that we who are alive and remain</b><br>This phrase addresses the concern of the Thessalonian believers regarding those who are still living at the time of Christ's return. It reflects the early Christian expectation of the imminent return of Jesus, a theme prevalent in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</a>). The phrase also highlights the hope and anticipation of believers for the Second Coming.<p><b>until the coming of the Lord</b><br>The "coming of the Lord" refers to the Parousia, the anticipated return of Jesus Christ. This event is a central theme in Christian eschatology and is mentioned in various passages such as <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>. The expectation of Christ's return was a source of hope and encouragement for the early church amidst persecution and trials.<p><b>will by no means precede</b><br>This phrase assures believers that those who are alive at Christ's return will not have an advantage over those who have died. It addresses concerns about the order of resurrection and the fate of deceased believers. This assurance is consistent with the teachings in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>, where the dead in Christ are raised first.<p><b>those who have fallen asleep</b><br>"Fallen asleep" is a euphemism for death, used to convey the temporary nature of death for believers. This metaphor is found in other New Testament passages, such as <a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11-14</a> and <a href="/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>, and reflects the Christian hope in the resurrection.

It does not mean "According to certain words which Christ spoke," nor yet "<span class= "ital">By means</span> of a revelation from the Lord to me," but "<span class= "ital">By way of</span> a divine revelation:" "I tell you this as a message straight from God." In what way apostles and prophets became <span class= "ital">conscious</span> of supernatural inspiration we cannot tell; but elsewhere also St. Paul speaks of possessing the consciousness sometimes and not at others. (See <a href="/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1Corinthians 7:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-25.htm" title="Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.">1Corinthians 7:25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-40.htm" title="But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.">1Corinthians 7:40</a>.) He means this declaration here to hold good of the <span class= "ital">details, </span>which are such as no one would <span class= "ital">invent</span> and teach with such solemnity; at the same time it must be remembered, with regard to the details, that it is the very idiom of prophecy (which St. Paul here uses) to express by material imagery spiritual facts.<p><span class= "bld">We which are alive and remain.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">We, </span>(<span class= "ital">that is</span>)<span class= "ital"> the quick, those who are left over.</span> There is not the least necessity for supposing from these words that St. Paul confidently <span class= "ital">expected</span> the Advent before his death. Very likely he did, but it cannot be proved from this passage. Had the "we" stood alone, without the explanatory participles, it might have amounted to a proof, but not so now. His converts are strongly under the impression that <span class= "ital">they</span> will be alive at the Coming, and that it will be the worse for the departed: therefore, St. Paul (becoming all things to all men) identifies himself with them--assumes that it will be as they expected--and proves the more vividly the fallacy of the Thessalonians' fears. It would have been impossible, on the contrary, for St. Paul to have said "we which are dead" without definitely abandoning the hope of seeing the Return. Besides which, St. Paul is only <span class= "ital">picturing</span> to imagination the <span class= "ital">scene</span> of the Advent; and for any man it is far easier to imagine himself among the quick than among the dead at that moment.<p><span class= "bld">Shall not prevent</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"be before," "get the start of." If it were not for these words, we might have fancied that the Thessalonians had not been taught to believe in a resurrection at all; which would have been a strange departure from the usual apostolic gospel (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;">1Corinthians 15:1</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> We here learn what was the exact nature of the Thessalonians' anxiety concerning the dead. They were full of excited hopes of the coming of that kingdom which had formed so prominent a part of the Apostles' preaching there (<a href="/acts/17-7.htm" title="Whom Jason has received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.">Acts 17:7</a>); and were afraid that the highest glories in that kingdom would be engrossed by those who were alive to receive them; and that the dead, not being to rise till afterwards, would have less blessed privileges. This would make them not only sorry for their dead friends, but also reluctant to die themselves. The negative in this clause is very emphatic in the Greek, and throws all its force upon the verb: "We shall certainly not get the <span class= "ital">start</span> of them that sleep;" <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"if anything, we shall be <span class= "ital">behind</span> them; they will rise <span class= "ital">first."</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">by a word of the Lord.</span> The apostle does not refer to those portions of the gospel which record our Lord's discourses concerning the last things; nor to some sayings of Christ preserved by tradition; but to a direct revelation made unto himself by the Lord. We know from Scripture that Paul had many such revelations imparted to him (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord.</span> These words are the occasion of an important discussion. It has been affirmed that the apostle here asserts that he himself expected to be alive, with the majority of those to whom he was writing, at the Lord's advent; that, according to his expectation, Christ's second coming was close at hand. "Those who are alive and remain" are distinguished from "those who are asleep," and in the former class the apostle includes himself and his readers. And a similar declaration is contained in the First Epistle to the Corinthians: "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>). Such is the view adopted by Grotius, Olshausen, Koch, Neander, Lechler, Baur, Winer, Reuse, Lunemann, Riggenbach; and, among English divines, by Alford, Jowett, Stanley, and Conybeare. Some of them suppose that Paul changed his opinion on this point - that whilst in his earlier Epistles he taught the immediateness of the advent, in his later Epistles he renounced this hope and looked forward to his own departure. There does not seem to be any ground for this opinion. On the contrary, it would appear from the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, written only a few weeks after this Epistle, that Paul did not expect the advent immediately, but mentions a series of events which would intervene before its occurrence (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1-3</a>). And in this Epistle he represses the curiosity of the Thessalonians about the precise time of the advent by telling them that it was beyond the sphere of his teaching (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:1, 2</a>). We consider, then, that the apostle speaks here as a member of the Christian body, and uses a very common form of expression - that we Christians which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord; but not at all intending to express his confidence that he himself and his converts would be actually alive at the advent. "He spake," says St. Chrysostom, "not of himself, but of Christians who would be alive at the day of judgment." Such is the view adopted by Chrysostom, Calvin, Bengel, Hofmann, Lunge, Macknight, Ellicott, Bishop Alexander, Wordsworth, and Vaughan. At the same time, it must be remembered that the time of the advent was expressly concealed (<a href="/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>; <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>), and that it might occur at any period; and, by reason of their proximity to the first advent, the primitive Christians would be deeply impressed with the possibility or even probability of its occurrence in their days. Christians were to be living always in readiness for this great event, and thus it became a matter of expectation. "Strictly speaking, the expectation of the day of the Lord was not a belief, but a necessity in the early Church; clinging as it did to the thought of Christ, it could not bear to be separated from him; it was his absence, not his presence, that the first believers found it hard to realize" (Jowett). Hence Paul might not regard the advent as far removed into the distant future, as wholly impossible to happen in his days, but as an occurrence which might at any time take place; but he did not teach anything definite or certain on the subject. <span class="cmt_word">Shall not prevent</span>; go before or anticipate, obtain the preference over, get before, so that those that are asleep might be left behind and fail of the prize. <span class="cmt_word">Them that are asleep</span>; those who are dead, so that they, the living, should be glorified before them, or perhaps hinder their glorification. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">By</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
