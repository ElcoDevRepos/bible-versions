His inability to endure the uncertainty about their spiritual state highlights his genuine love and responsibility as an apostle. This phrase reflects the emotional burden Paul carried for the churches he planted, similar to his sentiments in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>, where he speaks of his daily concern for all the churches.<p><b>I sent to find out about your faith</b><br>Paul's decision to send Timothy to Thessalonica (as mentioned in <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>) underscores the importance he placed on the spiritual well-being of the believers. This action demonstrates the early church's practice of sending trusted individuals to support and strengthen new congregations. It also reflects the apostolic model of discipleship and accountability, ensuring that the faith of new believers was genuine and growing.<p><b>for fear that the tempter had somehow tempted you</b><br>The "tempter" refers to Satan, who is often depicted in Scripture as seeking to undermine the faith of believers (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). Paul's concern was that the Thessalonians might have been led astray by persecution or false teachings, which were prevalent challenges in the early church. This echoes Jesus' parable of the sower, where the seed sown among thorns is choked by the cares of the world and deceitfulness of riches (<a href="/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a>).<p><b>and that our labor might have been in vain</b><br>Paul's use of "labor" indicates the hard work and effort he invested in establishing the Thessalonian church. The possibility of it being "in vain" suggests a concern that their initial acceptance of the gospel might not have resulted in lasting faith. This reflects the biblical theme of perseverance, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>, where believers are encouraged not to grow weary in doing good, for in due season they will reap if they do not give up.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Thessalonians.

The reason behind verse 5 is the same heartfelt concern: he longs to make sure newborn believers stand firm amid persecution (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a>; 3:3&#8211;4).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows this motive repeatedly&#8212;&#8220;besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches&#8221; (2 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 11</a>:28). Paul acts because shepherds must guard the flock (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28&#8211;31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when I could bear it no longer</b><p>&#8226; Paul reaches the point where waiting hurts more than acting. His pastoral heart refuses to sit idly while spiritual danger threatens.<p>&#8226; Similar moments: &#8220;I had no rest in my spirit&#8221; (2 <a href="/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13</a>); &#8220;we were troubled at every turn&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5&#8211;6</a>). Godly leaders feel holy anxiety for others&#8217; faith, not for their own reputation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I sent to find out about your faith</b><p>&#8226; Verse 2 names the messenger: &#8220;we sent Timothy&#8230; to strengthen and encourage you in your faith&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith&#8212;not comfort, finances, or numbers&#8212;tops Paul&#8217;s checklist. Spiritual health is the true measure (<a href="/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>).<p>&#8226; This echoes his practice elsewhere: he dispatches co-workers &#8220;to learn of your circumstances&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>) and returns for follow-up visits (<a href="/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for fear that the tempter had somehow tempted you</b><p>&#8226; The phrase highlights Satan, &#8220;the tempter&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3</a>), who exploits hardship to derail believers (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Trials can mature faith (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2&#8211;4</a>), yet the enemy aims to twist them into stumbling blocks. Paul knows persecution plus false teaching could lure the Thessalonians into compromise or despair (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and that our labor might have been in vain</b><p>&#8226; Paul does not question the gospel&#8217;s power; he worries that outward fruit might be lost if the church caves to pressure. Similar wording appears in <a href="/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a> and <a href="/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>.<p>&#8226; His concern reinforces two truths:<p>&#8211; Ministry effort can be squandered when believers drift (2 <a href="/bsb/john/8.htm">John 8</a>).<p>&#8211; Diligence pays off when faith endures&#8212;&#8220;your labor in the Lord is not in vain&#8221; (1 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 15</a>:58).<p>&#8226; The verse invites every servant of Christ to guard both doctrine and disciples, so that initial harvest becomes lasting fruit (<a href="/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s message is simple yet urgent: Because he loves the Thessalonians, he cannot rest until he knows their faith is intact. He dispatches Timothy to check on them, aware that Satan is actively tempting and that persecution could undo hard-won gains. The verse models pastoral vigilance, spiritual warfare awareness, and the primacy of persevering faith&#8212;all anchored in confidence that genuine labor, protected by God, will ultimately not be in vain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">For this cause.</span>--"Because I knew that temptation was sure to overtake you, I sent to see whether our work still lived, and was likely to live, in spite of it."<p><span class= "bld">To know your faith.</span>--"To ascertain whether you still believed:" only the form courteously implies that the faith was certainly <span class= "ital">there, </span>and St. Paul only sent to "make assurance doubly sure."<p><span class= "bld">The tempter.</span>--See <a href="/matthew/4-3.htm" title="And when the tempter came to him, he said, If you be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.">Matthew 4:3</a>.

The striking out of the comma after "tempted you," and reading the clauses quickly together, will give a fair notion of the purport. It might be paraphrased, "Lest, in consequence of the temptations which the tempter brought against you, our toil should prove in vain." The "temptations" were those of persecution, and the time at which they befell, the same as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm" title="For truly, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and you know.">1Thessalonians 3:4</a>, "it came to pass."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this cause, when I could no longer forbear</span>; no longer repress my anxiety, and endure my want of information concerning you. <span class="cmt_word">I sent to know your faith</span>; to receive information concerning your spiritual condition. <span class="cmt_word">Lest by some means the tempter</span>; a designation of Satan, used also by <a href="/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Have tempted you, and our labor be in vain</span>; that is, useless, without result (see on 1 Thessalonians 2:1; comp. also <a href="/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>, "I am afraid, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain"). The temptation to which the Thessalonians were exposed was that of apostasy from Christianity, through the fear or endurance of persecution. That the tempter had tempted them is probable - it was almost unavoidable; that he had succeeded in his temptation, and had thus rendered the apostle's labors among them useless, was uncertain - a contingency which might possibly have taken place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For this reason,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[when] I could bear [it]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#964;&#941;&#947;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(steg&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4722.htm">Strong's 4722: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cover, conceal, ward off, bear with, endure patiently.
