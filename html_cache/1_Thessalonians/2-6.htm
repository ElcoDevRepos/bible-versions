They did not seek human approval or accolades, which aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6:1</a> about not performing acts of righteousness to be seen by others. This reflects a heart focused on God's approval rather than man's, a theme echoed in <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>. In the Greco-Roman world, public speakers often sought honor and recognition, but Paul contrasts this cultural norm by highlighting their genuine intent to serve.<p><b>although as apostles of Christ</b><br>The term "apostles" signifies those who are sent with authority. Paul and his companions were commissioned by Christ Himself, as seen in <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15-16</a>, where Paul is chosen as a vessel to carry Christ's name. This apostolic authority is rooted in their direct calling and mission from Jesus, distinguishing them from false apostles who sought personal gain. The role of an apostle was foundational in the early church, as described in <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>, where apostles and prophets are the church's foundation with Christ as the cornerstone.<p><b>we had authority to demand it</b><br>Paul acknowledges the authority vested in them as apostles, which could have justified seeking support or recognition. This authority is not self-assumed but divinely appointed, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-8.htm">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>, where Paul speaks of the authority given for building up the church. However, Paul and his companions chose not to exercise this right, reflecting Christ's example of humility and service (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-7</a>). This restraint underscores their commitment to the gospel's integrity and their desire to avoid any hindrance to its message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Thessalonians, emphasizing his role as a servant of Christ rather than seeking human approval.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/silas_and_timothy.htm">Silas and Timothy</a></b><br>Co-authors of the letter, who accompanied Paul in his missionary journeys and shared in the ministry to the Thessalonians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where Paul, Silas, and Timothy established a church and faced opposition, yet continued to minister with integrity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostles_of_christ.htm">Apostles of Christ</a></b><br>Refers to those sent by Christ with authority to preach the Gospel, including Paul and his companions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonian_church.htm">Thessalonian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a young church facing persecution and needing encouragement and instruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_and_humility.htm">Authority and Humility</a></b><br>Paul and his companions had the authority as apostles but chose not to exercise it for personal gain.

The reference here is not to maintenance, but to glory: we did not seek glory from you, when we might have been burdensome, when we might have done so.
