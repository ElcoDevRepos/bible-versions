Thanksgiving is a central theme in Pauline theology, emphasizing the importance of recognizing God's hand in all aspects of life. This gratitude is not a one-time event but a continuous action, highlighting the ongoing relationship between Paul, his companions, and God.<p><b>when you received the word of God that you heard from us</b><br>The Thessalonians received the message of the gospel, which Paul and his companions preached. This phrase underscores the oral tradition of the early church, where the apostles and missionaries verbally communicated the teachings of Jesus Christ. The "word of God" here refers to the gospel message, which is consistent with the teachings found in other parts of the New Testament, such as <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, where faith comes from hearing the message of Christ.<p><b>you accepted it not as the word of men</b><br>The Thessalonians distinguished the gospel from mere human philosophy or teaching. In the Greco-Roman world, many itinerant teachers and philosophers traveled, sharing various doctrines. The Thessalonians' discernment in recognizing the divine origin of Paul's message is significant, as it sets the gospel apart from other contemporary teachings. This acceptance reflects a spiritual insight granted by the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, where spiritual truths are discerned spiritually.<p><b>but as it truly is, the word of God</b><br>This affirmation highlights the divine authority and inspiration of the gospel message. The phrase "word of God" is used throughout Scripture to denote messages that come directly from God, carrying His authority and power. This aligns with <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>, which states that all Scripture is God-breathed. The Thessalonians' recognition of this truth is a testament to their faith and the work of the Holy Spirit in their hearts.<p><b>which is also now at work in you who believe</b><br>The word of God is not static; it is active and transformative in the lives of believers. This dynamic nature of God's word is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, where it is described as living and active. The phrase "at work in you" suggests an ongoing process of sanctification, where believers are continually being shaped and molded by the teachings of Christ. This transformation is evidence of genuine faith and the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, where God is faithful to complete the good work He began in believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Thessalonians, expressing gratitude for their reception of the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonians.htm">Thessalonians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of believers in Thessalonica who accepted the Gospel message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine source of the message that Paul and his companions preached.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/word_of_god.htm">Word of God</a></b><br>The message of the Gospel that Paul preached, which the Thessalonians accepted as divine truth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those in Thessalonica who accepted the Gospel and in whom the word of God is actively working.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_divine_origin_of_the_gospel.htm">The Divine Origin of the Gospel</a></b><br>The Gospel is not merely human wisdom but the true word of God.

From this point (roughly speaking) to the end of 1 Thessalonians 3, the action of the <span class= "ital">converts</span> is the chief subject.<p>This verse differs from the original in several particulars of more or less importance. Literally translated, it would run thus: <span class= "ital">And for this cause we too thank God unceasingly, that, on receiving a word of hearing at our lips of God, ye welcomed, not a word of men, but </span>(<span class= "ital">as it is in truth</span>)<span class= "ital"> a word of God, which also, </span>etc.<p><span class= "bld">For this cause</span>--viz., because of the labours we went through to teach you, which we are thankful were not wasted. <span class= "ital">We too, </span>as well as you. The two words rendered "received" are not the same; the first meaning merely an outward reception, the second the welcome given. The words "it" and "as" (as the italics show) do not stand in the Greek. St. Paul is not expressing so much his gratitude for the manner in which the word was greeted, as for the essential character of what was greeted.<p><span class= "bld">The word of God which ye heard of us.</span>--The same phrase as in <a href="/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.">Hebrews 4:2</a>, which is there rendered, "the word preached." "The word might have been, so far as you knew, a mere <span class= "ital">word spoken by us</span>--ordinary men--but it was in reality a word of God, and so you found when you embraced it."<p><span class= "bld">You that believe.</span>--It could have no effect without this condition.
