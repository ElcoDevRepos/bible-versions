The "command" refers to the call to live a holy and sanctified life, as outlined in the preceding verses. In the context of <a href="/1_thessalonians/4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4</a>, Paul is addressing issues of sexual immorality and encouraging believers to live in a way that pleases God. The use of "rejects" indicates a deliberate choice to disregard divine instruction, highlighting the gravity of such an action.<p><b>does not reject man but God</b><br>Here, Paul underscores the divine authority behind his teachings. By stating that rejecting the command is not merely a rejection of human authority, he elevates the message to one of divine origin. This reflects the biblical principle that God's commands, delivered through His apostles, carry His authority. This echoes Jesus' words in <a href="/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>, where He states that rejecting His messengers is equivalent to rejecting Him.<p><b>the very One who gives you His Holy Spirit</b><br>This phrase highlights the intimate relationship between God and believers, as the Holy Spirit is given to them as a guide and helper. The presence of the Holy Spirit is a sign of God's active involvement in the lives of Christians, empowering them to live according to His will. This aligns with the promise of the Holy Spirit in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>, where Jesus assures His disciples of the Spirit's indwelling presence. The giving of the Holy Spirit also serves as a seal of God's ownership and a guarantee of the believer's inheritance, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>.<div
