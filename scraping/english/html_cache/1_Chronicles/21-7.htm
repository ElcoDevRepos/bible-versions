In the biblical context, taking a census was not inherently wrong, but it required divine sanction (<a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a>). David's action was driven by pride and a lack of trust in God's provision and protection. This phrase highlights the moral and spiritual evaluation from God's perspective, emphasizing that human actions are judged by divine standards. The phrase "in the sight of God" underscores the omniscience of God, who sees and evaluates the intentions of the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>so He struck Israel.</b><br>God's response to David's sin was to send a plague upon Israel, resulting in the death of 70,000 men (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-14.htm">1 Chronicles 21:14</a>). This demonstrates the principle of corporate responsibility, where the sin of a leader can have consequences for the people. It also reflects the seriousness with which God views sin, especially when it involves a breach of trust in Him. The striking of Israel serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and His people, where obedience brings blessing and disobedience brings judgment (Deuteronomy 28). This event foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption through Jesus Christ, who bore the consequences of sin on behalf of humanity (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who ordered the census, which was considered sinful in God's eyes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who judged the action as evil and brought consequences upon Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation that suffered as a result of David's sin, highlighting the communal impact of individual actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>David's military commander who initially resisted the king's order to conduct the census.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/census.htm">Census</a></b><br>The event initiated by David that led to God's displeasure and subsequent judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not just a personal matter; it affects others and grieves God.

Though a census is not sinful in itself (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2</a>; <a href="/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1&#8211;3</a>), David&#8217;s motive was rooted in self-reliance and pride. He wanted to measure military strength instead of trusting the LORD who had repeatedly delivered Israel &#8220;not by might, nor by power&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture labels the act &#8220;evil&#8221; because God alone defines good and evil (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>). David&#8217;s heart motive violated God&#8217;s command that kings depend on Him, not numbers (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16&#8211;20</a>; <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Joab&#8217;s objection (1 Chron 21:3) shows the sin was obvious to those who feared God. Refusing wise counsel deepened the wrongdoing (<a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a>; 15:22).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Also&#8221; connects this sin to earlier failures in Israel&#8217;s history; it was another chapter in a long story of human rebellion contrasted with divine faithfulness (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so He struck Israel</b><p>&#8226; Divine displeasure moved from verdict to action. God&#8217;s holiness demands that sin be judged (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>). In this case His discipline took the form of a devastating plague (1 Chron 21:14).<p>&#8226; The nation suffered because its leader sinned; Scripture often links a leader&#8217;s choices to corporate consequences (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1, 11</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a>). This underscores both the seriousness of leadership and the interconnectedness of God&#8217;s people (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet even judgment revealed mercy: God limited the angel&#8217;s hand before Jerusalem was destroyed (1 Chron 21:15&#8211;16), mirroring His pattern of remembering mercy in wrath (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22&#8211;23</a>; <a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The blow awakened repentance. David confessed, &#8220;I have sinned greatly&#8221; (1 Chron 21:8) and offered sacrifices on Araunah&#8217;s threshing floor, where God stopped the plague&#8212;a location that became the temple site (2 Chron 3:1). Judgment thus prepared the way for deeper worship and future blessing (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/21-7.htm">1 Chronicles 21:7</a> teaches that God views motives as well as actions, labels prideful self-reliance evil, and responds with righteous discipline that ultimately leads His people back to humility and worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7-13) The Divine wrath, declared by Gad the seer.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">And God was</span> <span class= "bld">displeased.</span>--This verse also is not read in Samuel, which has instead, "And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people." The peculiarities of expression in Samuel suggest textual corruption. The chronicler's verse is a sort of general heading, or anticipative summary, to the following narrative. The margin rightly renders the first clause (see Genesis 21 for the same unusual construction).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Smote Israel</span>. These two words serve simply to summarize in the first instance what the compiler is about to rehearse at greater length. The parallel place shows, "And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people." Some better power occasioned that smiting. Reflection brought to David's heart and conscience (<a href="/1_samuel/24-5.htm">1 Samuel 24:5</a>), as often to those of others, restored vitality. The exact circumstances or providences, however, which roused into action the conscience of David are not stated. The second clause of our verse cannot refer to any preliminary smiting, but to the oncoming visitation of pestilence. It is noticeable, if only as a coincidence, that the eleventh verse of the parallel passage (<a href="/2_samuel/24-11.htm">2 Samuel 24:11</a>) opens with a similarly ambiguously placed clause, "For when David was up in the morning, the word of the Lord came to the Prophet Gad," although this is explainable simply as our insufficient Authorized Version rendering. However, failing any external cause, the beginning of ver. 10 in this same parallel place may intimate the adequate account of all in the <span class="accented">spontaneous</span> stirring of David's conscience" the bitter thoughts of conscience born." In these two verses we suddenly come upon the name "God" instead of "the Lord," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehovah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/21-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
