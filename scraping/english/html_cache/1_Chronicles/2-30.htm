This genealogy is part of the Chronicler's effort to trace the lineage of the tribe of Judah, which is significant because it is the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ descended. The mention of Nadab here highlights the importance of family lineage in Israelite culture, where heritage and tribal affiliation played crucial roles in identity and inheritance.<p><b>Seled and Appaim.</b><br>Seled and Appaim are the sons of Nadab, continuing the genealogical record. The listing of these names, even when little else is known about them, underscores the importance of maintaining family records. This practice was vital for the Israelites, as it ensured the preservation of tribal and familial lines, which were essential for land inheritance and fulfilling God's promises to the patriarchs.<p><b>Seled died without children.</b><br>The mention of Seled dying without children is significant in the context of Israelite culture, where having descendants was considered a blessing and a means of continuing one's legacy. This detail may also serve to explain why Appaim's line is the one that continues, as the Chronicler is concerned with tracing the lineage that leads to David. The absence of children for Seled could be seen as a reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of God's providence in the continuation of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nadab.htm">Nadab</a></b><br>A descendant of Judah, Nadab is part of the genealogical record that traces the lineage of the tribe of Judah.

&#8220;The sons of Nadab: Seled and Appaim.&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-30.htm">1 Chronicles 2:30</a>a)<p>&#8226; This short clause sits inside a long genealogy tracing Judah&#8217;s descendants, beginning with &#8220;Judah was the father of Perez, Hezron, Carmi, Hur, and Shobal&#8221; (1 Chron 4:1) and narrowing to the line of David (<a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Nadab appears as a grandson of Shammai, great-grandson of Onam, and great-great-grandson of Jerahmeel (1 Chron 2:28-29). God&#8217;s Word records these names to show His faithfulness in every generation, just as He promised Abraham that &#8220;in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Two sons are listed&#8212;Seled and Appaim&#8212;demonstrating the straightforward, literal accuracy of the chronicler. Similar twin listings appear elsewhere: &#8220;The sons of Elioenai: Hodaviah, Eliashib, Pelaiah&#8221; (1 Chron 3:24).<p>&#8226; By including even minor figures, Scripture affirms the value of every person in God&#8217;s redemptive story (compare <a href="/1_corinthians/12-22.htm">1 Corinthians 12:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Seled died without children</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Seled died without children.&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-30.htm">1 Chronicles 2:30</a>b)<p>&#8226; The notice that Seled left no offspring immediately shifts the genealogical focus to Appaim, ensuring the lineage does not break. A similar pivot occurs when Eleazar &#8220;had no sons, only daughters&#8221; and their line continued through their cousins (1 Chron 23:22).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty over fertility and family lines (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>); although one branch ends, His purposes stand.<p>&#8226; It also echoes the principle found in <a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>, where God provided for inheritance when a man died without sons. Here, the chronicler silently applies that principle: the heritage moves to Appaim, then to Ishi, Sheshan, and Ahlai (1 Chron 2:31-35).<p>&#8226; By noting Seled&#8217;s childlessness, Scripture preserves historical accuracy and protects the integrity of the Davidic genealogy, safeguarding the promise that the Messiah would come from Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/2-30.htm">1 Chronicles 2:30</a> matter-of-factly records that Nadab had two sons, yet only Appaim carried the line forward because Seled died childless. Even this brief detail displays God&#8217;s meticulous care over His covenant family, highlights His control over life and legacy, and assures readers that every promise&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Christ&#8212;rests on a trustworthy, historically accurate foundation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">Seled died without children.</span>--That is, the clan <span class= "ital">Seled</span> did not multiply, and subdivide into new groups.
