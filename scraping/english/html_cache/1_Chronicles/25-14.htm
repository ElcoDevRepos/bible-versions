By calling Jesharelah by name, Scripture underscores that individual faithfulness matters. Like Bezalel and Oholiab who were filled with the Spirit for artistic skill (<a href="/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a>), Jesharelah was singled out for a Spirit-directed task: leading praise that edified Israel and glorified God (<a href="/psalms/40-3.htm">Psalm 40:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His sons</b><p>Ministry was a family affair.
