The period referred to is during David's rise to power, after the death of King Saul. It was a time of transition and uncertainty in Israel, as the nation was moving from the rule of Saul to the establishment of David's kingship. This period is marked by political and military upheaval, as well as divine intervention in the establishment of David's reign.<p><b>men came to David day after day</b><br>This indicates a continuous and growing support for David. The men who came were likely warriors and leaders from various tribes of Israel, recognizing David's anointing by God and his rightful claim to the throne. This influx of support reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to David and the people's recognition of his leadership. It also highlights the unity forming around David, as people from different backgrounds and regions joined him.<p><b>to help him</b><br>The assistance provided to David was both military and moral. These men were not just soldiers; they were committed to supporting David's cause and the establishment of his kingdom. This help was crucial in consolidating David's power and preparing for the eventual unification of Israel under his rule. It also signifies the divine favor upon David, as God moved the hearts of the people to support him.<p><b>until he had a great army</b><br>The gathering of a great army signifies the strength and legitimacy of David's leadership. This army was not just large in number but also composed of skilled and valiant warriors, as detailed in the surrounding verses. The formation of this army was a key factor in David's ability to secure his kingdom and defeat his enemies, fulfilling God's promise to establish his throne.<p><b>like the army of God</b><br>This comparison elevates David's army to a divine standard, suggesting that it was not only large and powerful but also blessed and guided by God. The phrase implies that the army was invincible and divinely ordained, much like the heavenly hosts. This reflects the biblical theme of God fighting for His chosen leaders and people, as seen in other scriptures where God intervenes on behalf of Israel. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's kingdom, with David as a type of Christ, the ultimate King and leader of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who was gathering support and building his army while Saul was still reigning.
