The Levites were set apart for religious duties, and their genealogies are meticulously recorded to ensure the purity of their service. This phrase highlights the importance of family lineage in maintaining the sanctity and order of temple responsibilities. The mention of Jehieli's sons underscores the continuity of service and the passing down of duties from one generation to the next, reflecting the biblical emphasis on heritage and faithfulness.<p><b>Zetham, and his brother Joel</b><br>Zetham and Joel are identified as brothers, which emphasizes the familial aspect of their service. In the biblical context, brothers often worked together in ministry, reflecting unity and cooperation. The naming of these individuals indicates their specific roles and responsibilities, which were crucial for the functioning of the temple. This also points to the broader biblical theme of God using families to accomplish His purposes, as seen in other scriptural examples like Moses and Aaron or James and John.<p><b>They were in charge of the treasuries of the house of the LORD</b><br>Being in charge of the treasuries was a position of great responsibility and trust. The treasuries contained offerings and valuable items dedicated to the temple, which were used for its maintenance and the support of the Levites. This role required integrity and faithfulness, as mishandling these resources would have been a serious offense. The phrase highlights the organizational structure of temple service, where specific duties were assigned to ensure the proper functioning of worship. This can be connected to the New Testament teaching on stewardship, where believers are called to manage God's resources wisely. The treasuries also symbolize the spiritual wealth and blessings found in God's house, pointing to the greater treasure found in Christ, who is the fulfillment of the temple and its services.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehieli.htm">Jehieli</a></b><br>A Levite whose sons were appointed to oversee the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
