Known for his military prowess and political acumen, Joab's response here reflects his awareness of the spiritual and moral implications of David's command. His reply indicates a rare moment where he challenges the king, showing his understanding of the potential consequences of the census.<p><b>&#8220;May the LORD multiply His troops a hundred times over.</b><br>This phrase reflects a common biblical blessing, expressing a desire for God's abundant provision and favor. It echoes the promises given to the patriarchs, such as God's promise to Abraham to multiply his descendants (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). Joab's statement underscores the belief that Israel's strength comes from divine blessing rather than human efforts.<p><b>My lord the king, are they not all servants of my lord?</b><br>Joab reminds David that the people of Israel are already under his authority and serve him as their king. This phrase emphasizes the existing loyalty and service of the people, questioning the necessity of numbering them. It suggests that David's desire for a census might stem from pride or a lack of trust in God's provision.<p><b>Why does my lord want to do this?</b><br>Joab's question challenges the king's motives, implying that the census could be driven by pride or a desire for self-reliance. In the cultural and historical context, a census was often associated with military conscription or taxation, which could indicate a shift in trust from God to human resources.<p><b>Why should he bring guilt on Israel?&#8221;</b><br>Joab warns of the potential spiritual consequences of the census, suggesting that it could lead to sin and divine judgment. This reflects the biblical principle that leaders' actions can have corporate consequences for the people they govern. The warning foreshadows the subsequent plague that comes upon Israel as a result of David's decision, highlighting the seriousness of disobedience to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who desires to take a census of the people, which is seen as an act of pride and lack of trust in God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, who questions the king's decision to conduct a census, warning of the potential guilt it could bring upon Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of God's chosen people, who are at risk of incurring guilt due to the king's decision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_census.htm">The Census</a></b><br>An event initiated by King David to count the fighting men of Israel, which is contrary to God's will and leads to consequences for the nation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>David's desire to number the people reflects a reliance on human strength rather than God's provision.

He anchors his protest in God&#8217;s proven ability to multiply, the existing loyalty of Israel&#8217;s troops, a probing of David&#8217;s motives, and a warning about shared guilt. The verse teaches that even seasoned leaders need voices of caution, that motives matter as much as actions, and that true security rests in the LORD who alone multiplies and protects His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Answered.</span>--Hebrew, <span class= "ital">said.</span><p><span class= "bld">The Lord . . . as they be.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Jehovah add upon his people like them an hundred times,</span> an<p>abridged form of what is read in Samuel.<p><span class= "bld">But, my lord the king, are they not</span> <span class= "bld">. . .?</span>--Instead of this, Samuel records another wish, "And may the eyes of my lord the king be seeing," that is, <span class= "ital">living</span> (<a href="/genesis/16-13.htm" title="And she called the name of the LORD that spoke to her, You God see me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that sees me?">Genesis 16:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Why then doth my lord require this thing?</span>--So Samuel, in slightly different terms: "And my lord the king, why desireth he this proposal?"<p><span class= "bld">Why will he be</span> (why should he become) <span class= "bld">a cause of trespass to Israel?</span>--Not in Samuel.

It was, no doubt, a very radical element of David's sin in this matter that he was thinking of the nation too much as <span class="accented">his</span> own servants, instead of as the servants of his one Master. The Lord ever knoweth who are his, and numbereth not only them and their names, but their every sigh, tear, prayer. <span class="cmt_word">A cause of trespass</span>. This clause may be explained as though <span class="accented">trespass</span> was equivalent to the consequences, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the punishment of trespass. This. however, rather tends to explain away than to explain a phrase. More probably the deeper meaning is that, in the fact of the numbering, nation and king would become one in act, and would become involved together in indisputable sin. Though there were no unfeigned assent and consent in the great body of the nation to the numbering, yet they would become participators in the wrong-doing. It would further seem evident, from Joab addressing these words to the king, that it was a thing familiarly known and thoroughly understood that the course David was now bent on following was one virtually, if not actually, prohibited, and not one merely <span class="accented">likely</span> to be displeasing to God on account of any individual disposition in David to be boastful or self-confident. Otherwise it would be scarcely within the province of Joab either to express or suppose this of his royal master. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/21-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
