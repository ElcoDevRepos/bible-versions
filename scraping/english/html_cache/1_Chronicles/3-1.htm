Hebron, located in the southern part of Judah, is one of the oldest cities in the region and holds historical significance as the burial place of the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/23-19.htm">Genesis 23:19</a>). This period in Hebron lasted seven and a half years before David became king over all Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4-5</a>). The sons born to David during this time represent the beginning of his royal lineage, which would eventually lead to the birth of Jesus Christ, fulfilling the prophecy of the Messiah coming from the line of David (<a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><b>The firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam of Jezreel:</b><br>Amnon, as the firstborn son, held a position of prominence and potential succession to the throne. His mother, Ahinoam, was from Jezreel, a city in the northern part of Israel, indicating David's alliances and marriages extended beyond Judah. Amnon's later actions, particularly his sin against his half-sister Tamar (2 Samuel 13), led to significant family strife and foreshadowed the turmoil within David's household. This reflects the biblical theme of the consequences of sin and the complexities of familial relationships.<p><b>The second was Daniel by Abigail of Carmel:</b><br>Daniel, also known as Chileab in some texts (<a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>), is the son of Abigail, the widow of Nabal. Abigail's story is one of wisdom and intervention, as she prevented David from committing bloodshed (1 Samuel 25). Her marriage to David after Nabal's death signifies a union of respect and mutual understanding. Daniel's mention here, despite his lack of further biblical narrative, underscores the importance of lineage and the fulfillment of God's promises through David's descendants. The name Daniel, meaning "God is my judge," may reflect the divine oversight and justice that permeates David's life and reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, a man after God's own heart, and a central figure in the Old Testament.

Six sons arrive during David&#8217;s seven&#8208;and&#8208;a&#8208;half-year stay in Hebron, underscoring both the blessing of fruitfulness (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>) and the responsibilities that come with it.<p>&#8226; By noting these births before David moves to Jerusalem, the text marks a transition: God is building David&#8217;s household even before establishing his throne in Zion (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-1.htm">1 Chronicles 11:1&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam of Jezreel;</b><p>&#8226; As firstborn, Amnon stood to inherit the double portion and leadership of the clan (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>). His later choices, however, forfeited that honor (<a href="/2_samuel/13-1.htm">2 Samuel 13:1&#8211;29</a>). Scripture&#8217;s honesty about Amnon&#8217;s sin warns that privilege without obedience breeds tragedy (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Ahinoam&#8217;s mention roots Amnon in Judahite territory (Jezreel in Judah, not the northern Jezreel), showing that his lineage was solidly within the covenant people.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s life illustrates that family leadership involves more than biological succession; spiritual guidance matters. Amnon&#8217;s downfall contrasts sharply with the ideal of a godly firstborn (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70&#8211;72</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the second was Daniel by Abigail of Carmel;</b><p>&#8226; Daniel&#8212;called Chileab in <a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>&#8212;is Abigail&#8217;s son. Abigail&#8217;s earlier testimony of faith and wisdom (<a href="/1_samuel/25-32.htm">1 Samuel 25:32&#8211;35</a>) hints at the godly nurture Daniel likely received.<p>&#8226; Unlike Amnon, Daniel leaves no recorded scandal or rebellion. While the Bible stays silent on his later life, that very silence may imply a steady, faithful existence (<a href="/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The dual name (Daniel/Chileab) does not signal error but complement: Chronicles highlights &#8220;Daniel&#8221; (&#8220;God is my Judge&#8221;), underscoring accountability to the Lord, whereas Samuel&#8217;s &#8220;Chileab&#8221; (&#8220;Like the father&#8221;) points to resemblance to David.

Chileab may have had a second name (comp. Uzziah-Azariah, Mattaniah-Zedekiah), especially as Chileab appears to be a nickname, meaning "dog." (Comp. the Latin Canidius, Caninius, as a family name.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - The whole of this chapter is occupied with the descendants of <span class="cmt_word">David</span>: the first nine verses of it with his own sons, classified according to the place of their birth, Hebron or Jerusalem; the remaining verses with the line of kings of his house to Jeconiah and Zedekiah (ver. 16), the grandsons of Zerubbabel (ver. 21), and descendants of Shechaniah (ver. 24). To the seven years and six months (<a href="/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>) of David's reign at Hebron six sons belong, each of a different mother. To the thirty and throe years (<a href="/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-11.htm">1 Kings 2:11</a>) of his reign at Jerusalem belong other thirteen sons, viz. four of one mother, <span class="cmt_word">Bethshua</span>, and nine of other mothers, whose names are not given. The list of the six Hebron sons, with their mothers, is nearly identical with that of <a href="/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2-5</a>, although the differences, slight as they are, would of the two indicate our list here rather as <span class="accented">not</span> copied than copied thence. The only noticeable difference, however, is in the name of the second son, announced here as <span class="cmt_word">Daniel</span>, instead of Chileab, while the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. This, together with the circumstance that one word would, as regards the Hebrew characters, comparatively easily convert into the other. renders it probable that it is merely a corrupt text or text obscure at this point which has occasioned the difference. The meaning of the name Daniel, put side by side with what we read in <a href="/1_samuel/24-15.htm">1 Samuel 24:15</a>, 25:39, suggests strongly that it is the right name of the two. It was a name likely to be given by David to his first child by <span class="cmt_word">Abigail</span>. Additional suspicion is thrown on the name Chileab through the three last letters of it, "<span class="accented">leab</span>," constituting also the three first of the very next word," <span class="accented">of Abigail"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>) which looks very much like the over-haste of the pen uncorrected. It is remarkable that the Syriac and Arabic versions translate "Caleb," both here and in the parallel passage. For the sons born in Jerusalem we have all three parallel lists at command, and the variations are rather greater. The other two lists are in <a href="/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14-16</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/14-4.htm">1 Chronicles 14:4-7</a>. The first of these omits <span class="cmt_word">Eliphelet</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Nogah</span> (possibly they died young or without issue), and the latter calls Eliphelet <span class="accented">Elpalet</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>). Again, <span class="cmt_word">Shimeah</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Elishama</span> in our passage must yield, overruled by the consent of the other two, to Shammuah and Elishua. Again, it is to be noticed that the name <span class="cmt_word">Eliada</span> (God (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>) knoweth), on occasion of its <span class="accented">latest</span> occurence (<a href="/1_chronicles/14-7.htm">1 Chronicles 14:7</a>), appears as <span class="accented">Beel</span>iada (the Lord (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>) knoweth), preserving therein probably its <span class="accented">earlier form</span>, viz. that used before a settled bad sense had come to be attached to the word Baal (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1444;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
