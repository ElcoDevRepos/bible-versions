In the biblical context, strength is often associated with reliance on God rather than mere physical might. <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a> echoes this sentiment, where God commands Joshua to be strong and courageous. The strength here is not just physical but also moral and spiritual, rooted in faith and trust in God's promises.<p><b>and let us fight bravely</b><br>The call to fight bravely reflects the necessity of courage in the face of adversity. In ancient Israel, warfare was a common reality, and bravery was a valued trait. This phrase emphasizes the importance of standing firm in the face of opposition, much like David's confrontation with Goliath in <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a>. The bravery called for is not reckless but is grounded in the assurance of God's presence and support.<p><b>for our people</b><br>This highlights the communal aspect of the battle. The fight is not just for personal glory but for the protection and welfare of the community. In the historical context, the Israelites were a covenant people, and their identity was deeply tied to their collective relationship with God. This communal focus is seen throughout the Old Testament, where the actions of individuals often have implications for the entire nation.<p><b>and for the cities of our God</b><br>The cities mentioned are not just physical locations but represent the dwelling places of God's people and, by extension, God's presence among them. Jerusalem, as the city of God, holds particular significance as the center of worship and the location of the Temple. The defense of these cities is seen as a defense of God's honor and His covenant promises. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God dwelling among His people, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>.<p><b>May the LORD do what is good in His sight.</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's sovereignty and ultimate control over the outcome of events. It reflects a deep trust in God's wisdom and goodness, reminiscent of Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>), where He submits to the Father's will. The phrase underscores the belief that God's plans are ultimately for the good of His people, as affirmed in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>. It is a statement of faith that, regardless of the immediate outcome, God's purposes will prevail.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, who is speaking in this verse.
