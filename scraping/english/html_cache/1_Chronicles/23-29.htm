It consisted of twelve loaves representing the twelve tribes of Israel, placed on a table in the Holy Place. This bread was a continual offering before the Lord, symbolizing God's provision and the covenant relationship with His people. The priests were responsible for arranging these loaves in two rows or piles, which were replaced every Sabbath. This practice is detailed in <a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>. The showbread can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the "Bread of Life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), signifying spiritual sustenance and God's presence with His people.<p><b>the fine flour for the grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, described in <a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2</a>, was a voluntary act of worship, recognizing God's provision and expressing devotion. It consisted of fine flour, oil, and frankincense, symbolizing purity, the Holy Spirit, and prayer, respectively. The use of fine flour indicates the offering's quality and the worshiper's dedication. This offering was part of the daily sacrifices and was often accompanied by burnt offerings. It reflects the believer's call to offer their best to God and can be seen as a precursor to the ultimate offering of Christ, who was without blemish.<p><b>the wafers of unleavened bread</b><br>Unleavened bread, used during the Feast of Unleavened Bread and other offerings, symbolizes purity and separation from sin, as leaven often represents sin in Scripture (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>). The absence of leaven in these wafers highlights the call to holiness and the need for a sinless sacrifice, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The use of unleavened bread in offerings underscores the importance of sincerity and truth in worship.<p><b>the baking</b><br>The process of baking the offerings was a practical aspect of preparing the grain offerings and showbread. It required skill and attention to detail, reflecting the care and reverence due to God in worship. The baking of these offerings ensured they were suitable for presentation before the Lord, emphasizing the importance of preparation and dedication in service to God.<p><b>the mixing</b><br>Mixing the ingredients for the grain offerings involved combining fine flour with oil and sometimes frankincense. This act symbolizes the unity and harmony required in worship and service. The oil represents the Holy Spirit's anointing, essential for any offering to be acceptable to God. The mixing process highlights the integration of divine and human elements in worship, pointing to the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life.<p><b>and all measurements of quantity and size</b><br>Precise measurements were crucial in the preparation of offerings, reflecting God's order and attention to detail. This precision ensured that the offerings met the standards set by God, symbolizing the need for obedience and faithfulness in worship. The emphasis on measurements also points to the meticulous nature of God's law and His desire for His people to follow His commands accurately. This attention to detail can be seen as a reflection of God's perfect nature and His call for His people to strive for holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The tribe of Levi was set apart for religious duties and service in the temple.

The directions for making it are found in <a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>. The twelve unleavened cakes of which it consisted, heaped on the table in two piles, represented the twelve tribes, and intimated the Divine acceptance of the offerings of each faithful tribe (see also <a href="/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the fine flour for meat offering</span>.

These two words occur also in <a href="/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35, 36</a>, where they are rendered respectively "in measure" and "in meteyard."
