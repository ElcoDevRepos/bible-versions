In the context of <a href="/1_chronicles/16.htm">1 Chronicles 16</a>, this is part of a psalm of thanksgiving delivered by David when the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Jerusalem. The wonders refer to the miraculous events such as the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>), the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-12), and the provision of manna in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4-5</a>). These acts demonstrate God's power and faithfulness to His people. The call to remember is a common biblical theme, urging believers to keep God's mighty deeds at the forefront of their minds, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a> and <a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11</a>.<p><b>His marvels</b><br>The term "marvels" emphasizes the extraordinary nature of God's actions, which inspire awe and reverence. These include not only the miracles performed during the Exodus but also the ongoing acts of God in the lives of His people, such as the victories in battles and the establishment of Israel as a nation. The marvels of God are a testament to His sovereignty and serve as a reminder of His covenant promises. In the New Testament, Jesus' miracles, such as healing the sick and raising the dead, are seen as a continuation of God's marvelous works, pointing to His divine authority and compassion (<a href="/matthew/11-4.htm">Matthew 11:4-5</a>).<p><b>and the judgments He has pronounced</b><br>This phrase refers to the decrees and decisions made by God, often in the form of divine justice or punishment. In the historical context, these judgments include the laws given at Sinai (Exodus 20) and the consequences for disobedience, such as the exile of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6-23</a>). God's judgments are seen as righteous and just, reflecting His holiness and the moral order He established. They serve as a warning and a guide for righteous living. In the prophetic literature, God's judgments also point to future events, including the final judgment described in <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>. The judgments of God are ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who bore the penalty for sin and offers redemption to humanity (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel who organized the return of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem and led the people in worship and thanksgiving to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph_and_his_brothers.htm">Asaph and his brothers</a></b><br>Levites appointed by David to minister before the Ark, giving thanks and praise to the Lord.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>The sacred chest that represented God's presence with His people, brought to Jerusalem by David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the Ark was brought, becoming the central place of worship for Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were called to remember His deeds and judgments as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembrance.htm">The Importance of Remembrance</a></b><br>Remembering God's past deeds strengthens our faith and trust in His future provision.
