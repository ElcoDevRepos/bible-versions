Building an altar was a common practice for worship and sacrifice, signifying dedication and repentance. This act of building an altar is reminiscent of the patriarchs like Abraham, who also built altars to worship God (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>).<p><b>and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</b><br>Burnt offerings were entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing complete surrender to God, while peace offerings were shared between the offerer, the priests, and God, symbolizing fellowship and thanksgiving. These offerings were part of the Levitical sacrificial system (Leviticus 1, 3) and demonstrated David's desire to atone for his sin and restore his relationship with God.<p><b>He called upon the LORD,</b><br>David's act of calling upon the LORD indicates a personal and direct appeal to God, reflecting a heart of repentance and dependence. This is a common theme in the Psalms, where David often calls upon God in times of trouble (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>).<p><b>who answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.</b><br>The divine response of fire from heaven signifies God's acceptance of David's sacrifice and repentance. This miraculous event parallels other instances in Scripture, such as Elijah's offering on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>) and the dedication of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/7.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>).
