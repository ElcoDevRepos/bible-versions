The "city" here is Jerusalem, which David established as the political and spiritual center of Israel. The act of building up the city signifies the beginning of Jerusalem's transformation into a significant urban center. This construction likely included strengthening the city's defenses and infrastructure, which was crucial for its future role as the capital. Theologically, this act symbolizes the establishment of God's chosen city, which would later become the site of the Temple, a central place of worship for the Israelites.<p><b>from the supporting terraces</b><br>The "supporting terraces" likely refer to the Millo, a structure or series of terraces that provided support and fortification to the city. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Millo was an important part of Jerusalem's defenses, possibly a stepped stone structure that helped stabilize the city's slopes. This construction reflects the strategic importance of Jerusalem and David's commitment to securing it against potential threats. The terraces also highlight the advanced engineering skills of the time and the importance of fortifications in ancient city planning.<p><b>to the surrounding wall</b><br>The "surrounding wall" indicates the fortification of the city's perimeter, essential for protection against invaders. Walls were a common feature of ancient cities, serving as the first line of defense. In biblical symbolism, walls often represent security and divine protection. The construction of the wall around Jerusalem can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to establish David's kingdom, providing a secure place for His people. This act of fortification is a precursor to the later expansions and enhancements made by subsequent kings, including Solomon.<p><b>while Joab restored the rest of the city</b><br>Joab, David's military commander, played a crucial role in the restoration and expansion of Jerusalem. His involvement underscores the collaborative effort in establishing the city as the capital. Joab's restoration work likely included repairing and enhancing existing structures, ensuring the city's functionality and livability. Historically, Joab's actions demonstrate the importance of military leaders in not only conquering but also developing and maintaining territories. This restoration can be seen as a type of Christ, who restores and renews, bringing order and peace to chaos, much like Joab did for the city.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The newly anointed king of Israel who established Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of the nation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>David's military commander who played a crucial role in the restoration and fortification of Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city that David captured and made the capital of Israel, also known as the City of David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/supporting_terraces.htm">Supporting Terraces</a></b><br>Architectural structures that provided stability and defense to the city, indicating the strategic importance of Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/surrounding_wall.htm">Surrounding Wall</a></b><br>The fortifications that protected Jerusalem from external threats, symbolizing security and divine protection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_spiritual_foundations.htm">The Importance of Spiritual Foundations</a></b><br>Just as David fortified Jerusalem, believers are called to strengthen their spiritual lives through prayer, scripture, and community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_delegation.htm">Leadership and Delegation</a></b><br>David's reliance on Joab for the restoration of the city demonstrates the importance of trusting and empowering others in leadership roles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_establishing_his_kingdom.htm">God's Sovereignty in Establishing His Kingdom</a></b><br>The transformation of Jerusalem into the City of David illustrates God's hand in establishing His purposes and plans.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_community_in_building_and_restoration.htm">The Role of Community in Building and Restoration</a></b><br>The collective effort in building the city walls serves as a reminder of the power of unity and collaboration in the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/security_in_god's_promises.htm">Security in God's Promises</a></b><br>The fortified walls of Jerusalem symbolize the security and protection found in God's promises to His people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Chronicles_11_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Chronicles 11:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/David_s_leadership_daily_inspiration.htm">How does David's leadership in 1 Chronicles 11:8 inspire your daily actions?

This phrase highlights David&#8217;s personal involvement&#8212;he is not a distant ruler but a shepherd-king who rolls up his sleeves.<p>&#8226; His action fulfills God&#8217;s word that Jerusalem would become the place where He sets His Name (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13</a>).<p>&#8226; By building &#8220;around it,&#8221; David unifies scattered fortifications into a single, secure center, mirroring how he is unifying the tribes under one throne (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38-40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the supporting terraces</b><p>The &#8220;supporting terraces&#8221; (often called the Millo) were massive earthworks that buttressed the city&#8217;s steep slopes.

According to the chronicler David started from that point, and brought his line of defences round to it again. Samuel has simply, "And David built around, from the Millo, and inward." This seems to mean that he carried his buildings from the fortress towards the interior of the city. Both statements may, of course, be true.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Millo</span>. There is great uncertainty as to the derivation and the meaning of this word. It is probably not really of Hebrew extraction, but of the oldest Canaanitish origin. In the Hebrew it is always used with the article, and would presumably come from the Hebrew root "to fill." Josephus seems to use, as synonymous expression for "<span class="accented">David's wall round Millo</span>," this, viz. "buildings round about the lower city" ('Jud. Ant.,' 3:2, compared with 5; 'Wars,' 6:1, where he identifies those "buildings," etc., with <span class="accented">Acra</span>). As the name of a family, it is mentioned in connection with Shechem, known specially as a place of the Canaanites (<a href="/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 20</a>). The Septuagint represents it by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. In the remarkable passage, <a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>, the word "Silla" is even a greater enigma, which, however, may designate the "steps from the city of David" (<a href="/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>), or "the <span class="accented">causeway of going up"</span> to the west of the temple (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-16.htm">1 Chronicles 22:16</a>). The likeliest view of Mille is that it was a very strong point of fortification in the surrounding defences of the hill of Zion (<a href="/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>). In <a href="/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a> the otherwise unvarying translation (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) of the Septuagint is superseded by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, a word itself of doubtful signification. For while some would render it by the word "foundation," Schleusner translates it "height." Grove (in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:367) puts it in "the neighbourhood of the Tyropaean valley at the foot of Zion." Some clue may lie in the word "inward," applied to the building by David. Does it imply a covering by edifices of the space, or some portion of it, that lay between Zion and the rest of the city?
