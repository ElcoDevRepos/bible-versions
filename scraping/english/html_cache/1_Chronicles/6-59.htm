It is mentioned in the context of the Levitical cities, indicating its role in supporting the priestly tribe. The name Ashan means "smoke" or "cloud," possibly reflecting its geographical features or historical events. The town's inclusion in the Levitical cities underscores the importance of providing for the Levites, who had no inheritance of their own. Ashan's location in the Negev region highlights the integration of the Levites into various parts of Israel, ensuring their presence and influence throughout the land.<p><b>Juttah</b><br>Juttah was a city in the hill country of Judah, given to the Levites. It is significant as a Levitical city, emphasizing the distribution of priestly duties across Israel. Juttah is also noted in the New Testament as a possible location where John the Baptist's parents, Zechariah and Elizabeth, lived. This connection to the New Testament provides a continuity of God's work through different covenants. The allocation of Juttah to the Levites reflects the broader biblical theme of God's provision for those who serve Him.<p><b>Beth-shemesh</b><br>Beth-shemesh, meaning "house of the sun," was a city on the border of Judah and Dan. It was strategically located and played a role in several biblical narratives, including the return of the Ark of the Covenant by the Philistines. As a Levitical city, it served as a center for worship and religious instruction. The city's history of conflict and its role in the Ark narrative highlight the ongoing spiritual battles faced by Israel. Beth-shemesh's inclusion in the Levitical cities underscores the need for spiritual leadership in areas of both peace and conflict.<p><b>together with their pasturelands</b><br>The mention of pasturelands indicates the practical provision for the Levites, who relied on these lands for sustenance. This provision reflects the broader biblical principle of supporting those dedicated to God's service. The pasturelands were essential for the Levites' livestock, ensuring their ability to perform their duties without the burden of agricultural labor. This arrangement allowed the Levites to focus on their spiritual responsibilities, serving as mediators between God and the people. The inclusion of pasturelands in the Levitical cities highlights God's care for the practical needs of His servants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ashan.htm">Ashan</a></b><br>A town allocated to the tribe of Simeon, located in the southern part of Judah.

Assigned to &#8220;the sons of Aaron of the clan of Kohath&#8221; as a Levitical city (<a href="/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>).<p>&#8211; Its inclusion in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-59.htm">1 Chronicles 6:59</a> underscores that God provided literal, geographic homes for priests so they could minister among the people (cf. <a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>).<p>&#8211;

Its assignment to the priests (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-59.htm">1 Chronicles 6:59</a>) placed spiritual leadership where the nation had already experienced God&#8217;s holiness, reinforcing the lesson that holy things require holy people.<p>&#8211; Also the site of conflict between Judah and Israel&#8217;s kings (<a href="/2_kings/14-11.htm">2 Kings 14:11</a>).
