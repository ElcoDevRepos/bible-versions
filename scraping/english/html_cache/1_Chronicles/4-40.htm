The mention of "rich, good pasture" suggests a land suitable for livestock, which was a primary source of wealth and sustenance in ancient Israelite society. This echoes the promise of a land flowing with milk and honey, as described in <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>, highlighting God's provision for His people. The imagery of pasture also connects to <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>, where God is depicted as a shepherd leading His flock to green pastures, symbolizing His care and guidance.<p><b>and the land was spacious, peaceful, and quiet</b><br>The description of the land as "spacious, peaceful, and quiet" emphasizes its suitability for settlement and prosperity. In biblical terms, spaciousness often signifies freedom and blessing, as seen in <a href="/genesis/26-22.htm">Genesis 26:22</a>, where Isaac finds room to flourish. Peace and quietness are indicative of God's favor and the absence of conflict, aligning with the prophetic vision of peace in <a href="/isaiah/32-18.htm">Isaiah 32:18</a>. This setting contrasts with the frequent turmoil and warfare experienced by the Israelites, underscoring a temporary fulfillment of the peace promised in the Messianic kingdom.<p><b>for some Hamites had lived there formerly</b><br>The reference to "Hamites" connects to the descendants of Ham, one of Noah's sons, as outlined in <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>. This historical note suggests a previous occupation by a non-Israelite group, which may have left the land fertile and developed. The displacement of these inhabitants can be seen as part of the broader narrative of the Israelites taking possession of the Promised Land, as God had commanded. This also reflects the theme of God using various peoples and circumstances to fulfill His purposes, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_simeonites.htm">The Simeonites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, descendants of Simeon, who were seeking new territory for their growing population.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rich,_good_pasture.htm">Rich, Good Pasture</a></b><br>The land discovered by the Simeonites, described as fertile and abundant, suitable for their needs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/spacious,_peaceful,_and_quiet_land.htm">Spacious, Peaceful, and Quiet Land</a></b><br>The characteristics of the land that made it desirable for settlement.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hamites.htm">Hamites</a></b><br>The previous inhabitants of the land, descendants of Ham, one of Noah's sons.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_negev.htm">The Negev</a></b><br>The broader region where this land was located, known for its arid conditions, making the discovery of fertile land significant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>Just as God provided the Simeonites with rich and good pasture, He provides for our needs today.
