This site is notably where David previously defeated Goliath, symbolizing God's deliverance and the triumph of faith over might. The presence of David here underscores his role as a divinely chosen leader, foreshadowing Christ as the ultimate deliverer. The mention of "he" refers to one of David's mighty men, highlighting the loyalty and valor of those who supported David, much like the disciples who followed Jesus.<p><b>when the Philistines gathered there for battle.</b><br>The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during the time of the judges and early monarchy. Their gathering for battle at Pas-dammim indicates their persistent aggression and desire to dominate the Israelites. This reflects the ongoing spiritual warfare faced by believers, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>. The Philistines' presence serves as a reminder of the need for vigilance and reliance on God's strength, paralleling the spiritual battles faced by Christians.<p><b>At a place with a field full of barley,</b><br>Barley fields were common in ancient Israel, representing sustenance and provision. The mention of a barley field situates the narrative in a real, agrarian context, emphasizing the disruption of daily life by war. Barley, often associated with the poor, symbolizes God's provision for all, echoing the feeding of the 5,000 with barley loaves in <a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>. This connection highlights God's ability to provide abundantly in times of need.<p><b>the troops fled from the Philistines.</b><br>The retreat of the troops illustrates human fear and the tendency to rely on one's strength rather than God's. This moment of fear contrasts with the courage of David and his mighty men, who trusted in God's deliverance. It serves as a reminder of the importance of faith and courage in the face of overwhelming odds, akin to the disciples' initial fear during the storm in <a href="/mark/4-40.htm">Mark 4:40</a>. The narrative encourages believers to stand firm in faith, trusting in God's power to overcome adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his leadership, military prowess, and heart for God.

The text may be restored thus: "He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines had gathered to the battle; and the men of Israel went up (perhaps, up the mountain side, in retreat). And he stood his ground, and smote the Philistines until his hand was benumbed, and clave to the sword. And Iahweh wrought a great victory on that day. And the people began returning (from flight) behind him only to spoil (the slain). And after him (was) Shammah ben Age, an Hararite. And the Philistines gathered together unto Lehi (<a href="/judges/15-9.htm" title="Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.">Judges 15:9</a>). And there there was a parcel, etc.," <a href="/1_chronicles/11-13.htm" title="He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.">1Chronicles 11:13</a>. The cause of this serious omission was perhaps the double occurrence of the phrase "the Philistines gathered together." The eye of some copyist wandered from one to the other. What was originally told of Eleazar the second hero, was that his prowess turned the flight at Pas-dammim into a victory.<p><span class= "bld">Where was a parcel of ground full of barley.</span>--The scene of the exploit of the third hero, Shammah, son of Age. Perhaps the Philistines were intent on carrying off the crop (<a href="/1_samuel/23-1.htm" title="Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing floors.">1Samuel 23:1</a>). Samuel reads lentils. The Hebrew words for barley and lentils are very similar.

Possibly the words should be the same, one being here spelt, by accident, wrongly for the other (so Kennicott). The first Bible mention of "barley" occurs in <a href="/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31, 32</a>, from which verses we learn that it, together with "flax," was an earlier crop than "rye" and "wheat." It was not only used for food for man (<a href="/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>; <a href="/judges/7-13.htm">Judges 7:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>), but also for horses (<a href="/1_kings/4-28.htm">1 Kings 4:28</a>). That it was nevertheless of the less-valued grain, we have significant indications, in its being prescribed for the "jealousy offering" (<a href="/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>, comp. with <a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>), and in its being part of the purchase price of the adulteress (<a href="/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>). Its derivation in the Hebrew, from a verbal root signifying "to bristle," is in noticeable analogy with the Latin <span class="accented">hordeum</span>, from <span class="accented">horreo.</span> Gesenius's observation, that the singular of the word given above in the Hebrew marks the "growing crop," and the plural the "grain" itself, seems hardly corroborated by this single passage at all events. The <span class="accented">lentile</span>, on the other hand, was a species of <span class="accented">bean</span>, and used much for soup, of which Egyptian tomb-paintings furnish illustration (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9</a>). Sonnini, in his 'Travels' (translation of Hunter, 3:288), tells us that still the Egyptian poor eat <span class="accented">lentile-bread</span>, but, what is more <span class="accented">apropos</span> of this passage, that in making it they prefer to mix a little "barley" with it. This apparent discrepancy between the parallel accounts not only counts in itself for very little, but may easily be surmounted by supposing that, though it be written that the "parcel" of ground was "full of lentiles," and again "full of barley," the description may only amount to this, that such parcels were in close juxtaposition. But if not, our allusion above to the possible error in the Hebrew words will sufficiently explain the variation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/11-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5973.htm">Strong's 5973: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;w&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at Pas-dammim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(dam&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition, Article &#124;
