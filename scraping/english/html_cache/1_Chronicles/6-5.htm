This lineage is significant as it traces the priestly line, which was responsible for the religious leadership and temple duties in Israel. The name Abishua means "my father is salvation," which reflects the theological emphasis on God as the source of deliverance and salvation. This genealogical record underscores the continuity of the priestly line, which was crucial for maintaining the religious and cultural identity of Israel. The mention of Abishua connects to the broader narrative of the Israelites' journey and their covenant relationship with God.<p><b>Bukki was the father of Uzzi</b><br>Bukki, as the son of Abishua, continues the priestly lineage. His name means "wasting" or "emptying," which might reflect a period of transition or challenge within the priestly line. The genealogical record here serves to affirm the legitimacy and continuity of the priestly office, which was vital for the spiritual leadership of the nation. Uzzi, the son of Bukki, further extends this line. The name Uzzi means "my strength," indicating a reliance on divine strength and support. This lineage is significant in the context of the Levitical priesthood, which played a central role in the worship and sacrificial system of Israel. The continuity of this line is also a testament to God's faithfulness in preserving His chosen leaders for the spiritual guidance of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abishua.htm">Abishua</a></b><br>A descendant of Aaron, the high priest, and part of the Levitical priestly line.
