This phrase highlights the special inheritance given to Aaron's descendants, emphasizing their unique role in Israel's religious life. The allocation of territories to the priestly families underscores the importance of providing for those who serve in the temple, as they did not receive a land inheritance like the other tribes (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>).<p><b>from the Kohathite clan</b><br>The Kohathites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, alongside the Gershonites and Merarites. The Kohathites had the most sacred duties, including the care of the Ark of the Covenant and other holy items (<a href="/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4-15</a>). Aaron's descendants, as part of the Kohathite clan, were given specific cities and lands to support their priestly functions, reflecting their elevated status among the Levites.<p><b>for their settlements</b><br>The term "settlements" refers to the cities and surrounding pasturelands allocated to the Levites. Unlike other tribes, the Levites did not receive a contiguous territory but were given cities scattered throughout Israel (<a href="/joshua/21.htm">Joshua 21:1-42</a>). This distribution allowed them to perform their religious duties and teach the Law across the nation, ensuring that worship and instruction were accessible to all Israelites.<p><b>because the first lot fell to them</b><br>The casting of lots was a common biblical method for making decisions, believed to reflect God's will (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>).

This allocation was in accordance with God's command to provide for the priests, who were dedicated to His service (<a href="/deuteronomy/18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-2</a>).

Ver. 61 seems to be an anticipation of vers. 66-70, with which verses, if we incorporate it, we shall obtain substantially the same results as are found in <a href="/joshua/21-5.htm">Joshua 21:5, 20-26</a>; but again we are glad of the latter source to supply for us the two places, Eltekeh and Gibbethon, necessary to enable us to count up the <span class="cmt_word">ten cities</span> of our ver. 61, while our <span class="cmt_word">Jokmeam, Aner</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">Bileam</span> appear as probably the corrected readings of <span class="accented">Kibzaim</span>, <span class="accented">Tanach</span>, and <span class="accented">Gath-rimmon</span> respectively in Joshua. The sons of Kohath.., left (ver. 61), the residue (Authorized Version, ver. 66), the remnant (ver. 70), point (as above) to the non-priestly descendants in the Kohath line. Summing up, we see that the Kohathite <span class="accented">priests</span> had thirteen cities from the allotments of Judah and Simeon and Benjamin, and the Ko-hathite non-priests had ten, from Ephraim, Dan, and West Manasseh. One might detect in all this some germ of the more modern parochial system, so far at least as regards the distributed residence of a clerical and ministerial order, though not with sacred buildings similarly distributed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/6-54.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now these [were]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1433;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
