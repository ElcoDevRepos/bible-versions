The throne is described as belonging to the LORD, indicating that the monarchy in Israel is seen as an extension of God's rule. This concept is rooted in the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where God is the ultimate king. The throne's divine attribution underscores the theocratic nature of Israel's monarchy, where the king is expected to rule according to God's laws and guidance. This idea is echoed in <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>, where God tells Samuel that the people's request for a king is a rejection of God as their king.<p><b>as king in place of his father David</b><br>Solomon's succession to the throne marks the continuation of the Davidic dynasty, which is significant in biblical history. David, a man after God's own heart, was promised that his lineage would endure forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Solomon's ascension fulfills part of this Davidic Covenant, which is ultimately realized in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, a descendant of David (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). The transition from David to Solomon also highlights the importance of dynastic succession in maintaining political stability and continuity in ancient Israel.<p><b>He prospered</b><br>Solomon's prosperity is a testament to God's blessing and favor upon his reign. This prosperity is not only material but also encompasses wisdom, peace, and influence. Solomon's wisdom, famously demonstrated in the judgment of the two women claiming the same baby (<a href="/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16-28</a>), is a gift from God, requested by Solomon himself (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>). His reign is characterized by peace and extensive building projects, including the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem, which becomes a central place of worship for Israel.<p><b>and all Israel obeyed him</b><br>The unity and obedience of Israel under Solomon's rule reflect a period of national cohesion and strength. This obedience is indicative of Solomon's effective leadership and the people's recognition of his God-given authority. It contrasts with later periods of division and disobedience, such as the split of the kingdom after Solomon's death (1 Kings 12). The unity under Solomon can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate unity and peace that will be established under the reign of Christ, the true King of Kings, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building the First Temple in Jerusalem.
