Their presence on all four sides signifies comprehensive protection and vigilance. This arrangement reflects the importance of maintaining order and reverence in worship, as seen in other parts of Scripture where gatekeepers are mentioned, such as <a href="/1_chronicles/26.htm">1 Chronicles 26</a>. The role of gatekeepers can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate guardian of His Church, ensuring that only those who are sanctified enter into His presence.<p><b>east, west, north, and south.</b><br>The mention of the four cardinal directions emphasizes the universality and completeness of God's protection and presence. In biblical symbolism, the number four often represents completeness, as seen in the four corners of the earth or the four living creatures in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>. This arrangement of gatekeepers could also symbolize the inclusivity of God's covenant, extending to all nations and peoples. Geographically, Jerusalem was a central location, and the temple was a focal point for worship, drawing people from all directions. This setup ensured that the temple was accessible yet safeguarded, reflecting the balance between openness to the faithful and the need for holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gatekeepers.htm">Gatekeepers</a></b><br>These were Levites assigned to guard the entrances of the temple.

Earlier in the chapter we read of &#8220;Shallum&#8230; and their kinsmen from his family&#8212;928 in all&#8221; (verse 22) who served in this role. Their assignment had deep roots: Moses first appointed gatekeepers for the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/3-25.htm">Numbers 3:25&#8211;26</a>), and David formalized the office for the temple (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-23.htm">1 Chronicles 15:23&#8211;24</a>; 26:1&#8211;19). They protected what was holy, maintained order, and welcomed worshipers&#8212;much as believers today are called to guard sound doctrine (<a href="/2_timothy/1-13.htm">2 Timothy 1:13&#8211;14</a>) and extend a gracious welcome (<a href="/romans/15-7.htm">Romans 15:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were stationed</b><p>The phrase reminds us that these men did not wander about; they held fixed posts. &#8220;They had been entrusted with responsibility for the chambers and treasuries in the house of the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26</a>). God is a God of order (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>). Just as the priests camped on assigned sides of the tabernacle in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3, 10, 18, 25</a>), the gatekeepers remained on duty day and night (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-33.htm">1 Chronicles 9:33</a>). Faithfulness today likewise involves staying at the task the Lord assigns (<a href="/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42&#8211;43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the four sides</b><p>Stationing guards on every side provided complete coverage. Nothing could approach the temple unnoticed, echoing the cherubim who guarded &#8220;every direction&#8221; at Eden&#8217;s gate (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>). Centuries later the New Jerusalem will have gates on all four points of the compass (<a href="/revelation/21-13.htm">Revelation 21:13</a>), showing that God&#8217;s dwelling is perfectly secure and yet open to all redeemed nations (<a href="/isaiah/60-11.htm">Isaiah 60:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>east</b><p>The east gate received the first light of dawn and the first flow of pilgrims. When Hezekiah reopened the temple, he gathered priests &#8220;in the square on the east side&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-4.htm">2 Chronicles 29:4</a>). Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord depart by the east gate (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18&#8211;19</a>) and return by that same gate (<a href="/ezekiel/43-1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1&#8211;4</a>), foreshadowing Christ&#8217;s triumphal entry. Sunrise still reminds us that God&#8217;s mercies are &#8220;new every morning&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/3-23.htm">Lamentations 3:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>west</b><p>The west side lay opposite the rising sun and closest to the Most Holy Place (<a href="/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33&#8211;34</a>). The imagery points to approach: God, enthroned between the cherubim, invited consecrated priests to come all the way in (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19&#8211;22</a>). A sentry at the west gate symbolized the need for holiness when drawing near (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>north</b><p>Invaders often came from the north (<a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>), so this side required careful watch. Ezekiel&#8217;s temple vision includes a north gate for priests bringing sacrifices (<a href="/ezekiel/40-35.htm">Ezekiel 40:35&#8211;37</a>). Believers today guard against doctrine or influence that would pull hearts away from the Lord (<a href="/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>south</b><p>The south gate opened toward warmth and abundance, a route often traveled by worshipers from Judah&#8217;s pastoral regions (<a href="/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26</a>). Philip met the Ethiopian official on &#8220;the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza&#8212;this is the desert road&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a>), illustrating how God sends good news to every direction. Gatekeepers on the south assured that no one approaching with sincere devotion would be turned away (<a href="/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/9-24.htm">1 Chronicles 9:24</a> underscores God&#8217;s orderly care: dedicated servants posted on every side so that His house stayed pure, secure, and welcoming. Their vigilance prefigures the church&#8217;s call to guard truth, practice holiness, and invite people from east, west, north, and south to come and worship the living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">In four quarters were the porters.</span>--"To the four winds used the warders to stand" (to be), viz., on the four sides of the tent of meeting, and from the age of Solomon on the four sides of the square enclosure of the Temple.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/9-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The gatekeepers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1465;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
