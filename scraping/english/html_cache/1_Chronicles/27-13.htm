This number indicates a well-organized and formidable force, capable of defending the nation against external threats.

Each division served one month every year, giving Israel a standing force without exhausting the populace. By the time we reach the tenth slot, nine units have already been named, underscoring steady organization and discipline (compare <a href="/1_chronicles/27-2.htm">1 Chronicles 27:2</a>,6,9). David&#8217;s leadership is practical&#8212;every tribe knows when its turn arrives&#8212;and spiritual, because orderly preparation reflects God&#8217;s own order (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the tenth month</b><p>This service period falls in the month later called Tevet, the heart of Israel&#8217;s winter (<a href="/esther/2-16.htm">Esther 2:16</a>).

Netophah, a village near Bethlehem (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-16.htm">1 Chronicles 9:16</a>), bred warriors loyal to David from his earliest days. Maharai&#8217;s appointment tells us:<p>&#8226; Proven courage qualifies him to command 24,000 soldiers.<p>&#8226; Hometown proximity to Bethlehem ties him to Judah&#8217;s heartland and to promises centered there (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal history of valor reassures the nation that experienced men, not novices, lead its defense.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A Zerahite</b><p>By calling Maharai &#8220;a Zerahite,&#8221; the text traces him to Zerah, son of Judah (<a href="/genesis/38-30.htm">Genesis 38:30</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-20.htm">Numbers 26:20</a>).
