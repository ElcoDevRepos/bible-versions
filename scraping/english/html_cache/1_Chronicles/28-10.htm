In the biblical context, it is a directive to Solomon, urging him to ponder the significance of his divine appointment. The act of considering is often associated with wisdom and discernment, qualities highly valued in the Hebrew tradition (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>).<p><b>that the LORD has chosen you</b><br>The concept of divine election is central here. Solomon is chosen by God, not by human decision, to fulfill a specific purpose. This echoes the theme of God's sovereign choice seen throughout Scripture, such as in the selection of David over his brothers (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7-13</a>) and Israel as His chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>).<p><b>to build a house for the sanctuary</b><br>The "house" refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for Israel. This task is significant as it represents the establishment of a permanent dwelling place for God's presence among His people. The Temple is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate dwelling place of God with humanity (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<p><b>Be strong and do it.</b><br>This exhortation emphasizes courage and action. The call to strength is reminiscent of God's encouragement to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6-9</a>) and underscores the need for divine empowerment to accomplish God's work. It also reflects the cultural value placed on strength and perseverance in leadership roles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is speaking to his son Solomon.
