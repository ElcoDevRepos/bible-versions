His close friendship with David is well-documented, highlighting themes of loyalty and covenantal friendship (<a href="/1_samuel/18.htm">1 Samuel 18:1-4</a>). Jonathan's lineage is significant as it connects the house of Saul to later generations, despite Saul's rejection by God as king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>). This phrase emphasizes the continuation of Saul's line through Jonathan, despite the political and spiritual decline of Saul's house.<p><b>Merib-baal,</b><br>Merib-baal is another name for Mephibosheth, Jonathan's son, who was crippled in both feet (<a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>). The name "Merib-baal" means "contender with Baal," reflecting a cultural context where names often had theological significance. The use of "Baal" in names was common in Israelite culture before it became associated with idolatry. Mephibosheth's story is one of grace and restoration, as David shows kindness to him for Jonathan's sake, allowing him to eat at the king's table (<a href="/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7-13</a>). This act prefigures the grace believers receive through Christ.<p><b>who was the father of Micah.</b><br>Micah, the son of Merib-baal, continues the lineage of Jonathan. This genealogical detail underscores the preservation of Jonathan's line, despite the fall of Saul's house. It also highlights the importance of family heritage in biblical narratives, where genealogies often serve to connect historical events and divine promises. The mention of Micah here may not directly connect to the prophet Micah, but it reflects the commonality of names and the importance of legacy in Israelite culture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.

Jonathan&#8217;s character and covenant loyalty to David are highlighted in <a href="/1_samuel/18-1.htm">1 Samuel 18:1&#8211;4</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/20-12.htm">1 Samuel 20:12&#8211;17</a>.<p>&#8211; By opening with Jonathan&#8217;s name, the chronicler assures readers that, despite national upheaval, God preserved Jonathan&#8217;s lineage exactly as promised (<a href="/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-42.htm">1 Samuel 20:42</a>).<p>&#8211; This lineage detail also supports the wider theme of <a href="/bsb/1_chronicles/9.htm">1 Chronicles 9</a>: God restores His people to their God-given places after exile, just as He preserved Jonathan&#8217;s line through danger and displacement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Merib-baal</b><p>&#8211; Merib-baal is another form of Mephibosheth (compare <a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/8-34.htm">1 Chronicles 8:34</a>). The shift in name was common as Israel distanced itself from the pagan title &#8220;Baal.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Though crippled in both feet (<a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>), Mephibosheth received steadfast kindness from King David (<a href="/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1&#8211;13</a>), illustrating that covenant faithfulness outweighs human weakness.<p>&#8211; By naming Merib-baal here, the chronicler echoes David&#8217;s mercy and God&#8217;s own mercy toward the weak, showing that physical limitation never thwarts God&#8217;s purposes (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was the father</b><p>&#8211; Scripture consistently affirms the blessing of posterity (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>). Even after tragedy, God granted Mephibosheth the dignity of fatherhood, proving He can rebuild broken lives.<p>&#8211; The phrase signals that Jonathan&#8217;s line did not end in obscurity; it advanced. God&#8217;s promises move forward through real families, generation after generation (<a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Micah</b><p>&#8211; Micah (spelled &#8220;Mica&#8221; in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-35.htm">1 Chronicles 8:35</a>) continues the Saulite line through Jonathan. His sons&#8212;Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-35.htm">1 Chronicles 8:35-36</a>)&#8212;mark at least four more generations.<p>&#8211; Including Micah in this restored-community chapter underlines that God weaves even diminished royal lines into His larger redemptive story, affirming that no branch He chooses is forgotten (<a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>).<p>&#8211; For returning exiles hearing these genealogies, Micah&#8217;s mention reinforced hope: if God remembered Jonathan&#8217;s descendant, He would remember them as well (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/9-40.htm">1 Chronicles 9:40</a> declares that Jonathan&#8217;s crippled son, Merib-baal, became the father of Micah. Each phrase underscores God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness: preserving Jonathan&#8217;s line, honoring the weak, granting ongoing generations, and integrating that lineage into Israel&#8217;s restored community. The verse testifies that God never abandons His promises, no matter how unlikely their fulfillment may appear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/9-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;en-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
