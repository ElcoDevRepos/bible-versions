The tribe of Dan was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Dan, the fifth son of Jacob and Bilhah. Historically, the tribe of Dan was known for its struggles with idolatry, as seen in <a href="/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>, where they set up a carved image. Azarel's leadership role signifies a position of responsibility and authority within the tribal structure. The mention of his father, Jeroham, provides a genealogical link, emphasizing the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite society. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's providence and the continuity of His promises through generations.<p><b>These were the leaders of the tribes of Israel.</b><br>This phrase highlights the organizational structure of the Israelite nation during the time of King David. The leaders, or chiefs, of the tribes were responsible for governance, military organization, and maintaining order within their respective tribes. This system of tribal leadership is rooted in the patriarchal traditions established by the twelve sons of Jacob, each representing a tribe. The role of these leaders was crucial in unifying the nation and ensuring adherence to the covenant with God. This structure also foreshadows the New Testament concept of the body of Christ, where different members have distinct roles but work together for the common good, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azarel.htm">Azarel</a></b><br>Azarel is identified as the leader over the tribe of Dan.
