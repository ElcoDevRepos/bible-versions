He was a leader of the tribe of Judah during the wilderness period (<a href="/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>). His role as a leader is underscored by his position as the first to bring an offering at the dedication of the altar (<a href="/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a>). Nahshon's lineage is important as it connects to the royal line of David and ultimately to Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-4.htm">Matthew 1:4-5</a>). The name Nahshon means "enchanter" or "oracle," which may reflect his esteemed position among the Israelites. Geographically, Nahshon and his descendants were part of the tribe of Judah, which settled in the southern part of the Promised Land, an area that includes Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Archaeological findings in this region have provided insights into the life and culture of the tribes during the period of the Judges.<p><b>and Salmon was the father of Boaz</b><br>Salmon is noted in the genealogies of both the Old and New Testaments, linking the period of the Judges to the monarchy of Israel. He is traditionally believed to have married Rahab, the Canaanite woman from Jericho who protected the Israelite spies (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>). This union is significant as it demonstrates God's grace and the inclusion of Gentiles into the covenant community. Boaz, Salmon's son, is a key figure in the Book of Ruth. He is a wealthy landowner in Bethlehem and becomes the kinsman-redeemer for Ruth, a Moabite widow. This act of redemption is a type of Christ, illustrating the concept of a redeemer who restores and provides for those in need. Boaz's marriage to Ruth also highlights the theme of God's providence and the inclusion of Gentiles in the lineage of David and Jesus. The story of Boaz and Ruth takes place in Bethlehem, a town with deep historical and theological significance, as it is the birthplace of both David and Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahshon.htm">Nahshon</a></b><br>Nahshon is a significant figure in the genealogy of Judah.
