His death marks a transition in the lineage, emphasizing the continuation of the family line despite his passing. Caleb-ephrathah is likely a location named after Caleb, a prominent figure in the tribe of Judah, known for his faithfulness and courage. This place may have been a settlement or region associated with Caleb's descendants, indicating the territorial expansion and settlement patterns of the tribe of Judah.<p><b>his wife Abijah bore to him Ashhur</b><br>Abijah, meaning "Yahweh is my father," reflects the theophoric naming common in Israelite culture, indicating a devotion to God. Her role in bearing Ashhur highlights the importance of women in continuing family lines and fulfilling God's promises to the patriarchs. Ashhur's birth signifies the ongoing fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham to multiply his descendants.<p><b>the father of Tekoa</b><br>Ashhur is identified as the father of Tekoa, a town in Judah. Tekoa is historically significant as the home of the prophet Amos, who prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah and Jeroboam II. The mention of Tekoa connects the genealogical record to the broader narrative of Israel's history, emphasizing the importance of lineage in the unfolding of God's plan.

By recording the moment of his death, the chronicler reminds us that God&#8217;s purposes are not stalled by a graveside. Life&#8212;and covenant promise&#8212;moves forward even when a patriarch passes away (cf. <a href="/numbers/26-1.htm">Numbers 26:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-22.htm">1 Chronicles 23:22</a>). The genealogy is literal history, marking real people whose lives fit into God&#8217;s unfolding plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in Caleb-ephrathah</b><p>Caleb-ephrathah (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-19.htm">1 Chronicles 2:19, 50</a>&#8211;51) sits near Bethlehem, the very region later identified by Micah as Messiah&#8217;s birthplace (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). Linking Hezron&#8217;s story to this specific locale roots the narrative in the soil of Judah&#8217;s inheritance (<a href="/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13</a>) and quietly ties Judah&#8217;s clan to the town where David&#8212;and ultimately Jesus&#8212;will be born (<a href="/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11</a>; <a href="/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4</a>). The chronicler is showing that God works through ordinary geography to achieve extraordinary redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his wife Abijah bore to him</b><p>Abijah (&#8220;Yah is my Father&#8221;) steps into the spotlight for one short line, yet her role is essential. Though Hezron has died, Abijah still carries his child, underscoring how God preserves a lineage even when death intrudes (compare <a href="/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5</a> for post-mortem line continuity). Scripture honors her faithfulness by naming her, spotlighting the often-overlooked women through whom God advances His promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ashhur</b><p>The baby born after the funeral is Ashhur. He resurfaces later as a clan leader (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-5.htm">1 Chronicles 4:5&#8211;7</a>), showing that no detail in God&#8217;s Word is wasted. From an apparently incidental birth springs a future builder of communities within Judah. God delights in taking small beginnings and shaping them into something that blesses generations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the father of Tekoa</b><p>Ashhur is called &#8220;the father of Tekoa,&#8221; meaning he founded or led the clan that settled the town. Tekoa becomes:<p>&#8226; a fortified city under Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-6.htm">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>)<p>&#8226; home to the wise woman Joab recruited (<a href="/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2</a>)<p>&#8226; the birthplace of the prophet Amos (<a href="/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>)<p>&#8226; a rally point in Jeremiah&#8217;s day (<a href="/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1</a>)<p>Thus, one posthumous son anchors a town that will influence kings, prophets, and national history. The chronicler&#8217;s brief note lets us trace God&#8217;s handiwork from a single crib to an entire community.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/2-24.htm">1 Chronicles 2:24</a> records literal history that spotlights God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness. Even after Hezron dies, the Lord ensures the continuation of Judah&#8217;s line through Abijah&#8217;s son Ashhur, who plants the roots of Tekoa&#8212;future home of prophets and strongholds. The verse reminds us that every name, place, and timing in Scripture is purposeful, proving that God weaves His redemptive story through real people in real places for real generations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">And after that Hezron was dead</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Or, "And after the death of Hezron in Caleb-ephratah--and the wife of Hezron was Abiah--and she bare him Ashur . . ."

(<span class= "ital">Ash</span> is the elder form of <span class= "ital">Ish</span> "man"; as appears from the Phenician inscriptions.)<p>That "Caleb" in this verse means the house of Caleb is evident if we consider that the genealogy makes <span class= "ital">him</span> great grandson of Judah, whereas the individual Caleb son of Jephunneh took part in the conquest of Canaan, more than four centuries after Judah went down to Egypt.<p><span class= "bld">III.--The Jerahmeelites</span> (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/2-25.htm" title="And the sons of Jerahmeel the firstborn of Hezron were, Ram the firstborn, and Bunah, and Oren, and Ozem, and Ahijah.">1Chronicles 2:25-41</a>).

No place <span class="cmt_word">Caleb-ephratah</span> is known, and no sort of accounting for Hezron dying anywhere but in Egypt, whither he went with Jacob (<a href="/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>), is producible. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">Ingressus est Caleb ad Ephratam</span>, but our Hebrew text cannot be made to justify it, if for nothing else, for want of a preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> before "Ephrata." This reading of the Vulgate has suggested to others that by a slight but still gratuitous alteration of our Hebrew text <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> might be substituted for the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> prefixed to the name of Caleb; but upon <span class="accented">that</span> showing we have to <span class="accented">suppose</span> that Caleb did leave Egypt on his own account and travel to Ephratah, and then there fails any strong connection (but see Septuagint, in <span class="accented">loc.</span>) between that fact and what is said about <span class="cmt_word">Abiah</span>. Still, the explanation might receive some countenance from the fact that it is said that Abiah's son became the father - or <span class="accented">founder - <span class="cmt_word"></span>of</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Tekoa</span>, a place near Bethlehem, in South Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>). Bertheau has at this point suggested that Caleb-ephratah, instead of being included in Neger-Caleb, may rather, in <span class="accented">distinction</span> from it, designate the northern portion of the territory of Caleb.
