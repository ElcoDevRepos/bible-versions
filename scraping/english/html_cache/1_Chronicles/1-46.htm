The Edomites were descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother, and often had a contentious relationship with Israel. The death of a king often signified a transition of power, which could lead to instability or change in leadership style. This phrase indicates a historical transition in Edom's monarchy.<p><b>Hadad son of Bedad</b><br>Hadad is a name associated with a storm god in ancient Near Eastern cultures, particularly among the Arameans and Canaanites. The use of this name suggests possible cultural influences or religious syncretism in Edom. Bedad, Hadad's father, is otherwise unknown, but his mention highlights the importance of lineage and heritage in ancient societies.<p><b>who defeated Midian in the country of Moab</b><br>This victory over Midianites, who were nomadic tribes often in conflict with Israel and its neighbors, suggests Hadad's military prowess. Moab, located east of the Dead Sea, was a region frequently mentioned in the Bible, often in conflict with Israel. This victory would have been significant in establishing Hadad's reputation and securing his rule.<p><b>reigned in his place</b><br>The phrase indicates the succession of Hadad to the throne of Edom. Succession was a critical aspect of maintaining stability and continuity in ancient monarchies. This transition also reflects the political dynamics of the time, where military success often legitimized a ruler's claim to the throne.<p><b>And the name of his city was Avith</b><br>Avith is mentioned as the city associated with Hadad's reign. While its exact location is unknown, the mention of a city underscores the importance of urban centers as seats of power and administration in ancient kingdoms. Cities were often fortified and served as symbols of a king's strength and influence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/husham.htm">Husham</a></b><br>A king mentioned in the genealogies of Edom, who reigned before Hadad.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hadad_son_of_bedad.htm">Hadad son of Bedad</a></b><br>A king who succeeded Husham and is noted for defeating Midian in Moab.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midian.htm">Midian</a></b><br>A people often in conflict with Israel, defeated by Hadad in this context.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A region east of the Dead Sea, significant in biblical history for its interactions with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/avith.htm">Avith</a></b><br>The city from which Hadad ruled, though its exact location is uncertain.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god_in_leadership_changes.htm">The Sovereignty of God in Leadership Changes</a></b><br>The transition from Husham to Hadad illustrates God's control over leadership and nations.

Scripture treats these changes as part of God&#8217;s orderly oversight of nations (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>). Just as <a href="/genesis/36-34.htm">Genesis 36:34</a> records Husham&#8217;s passing, 1 Chronicles reminds readers that Edom, like Israel, experienced leadership turnover under God&#8217;s providence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hadad son of Bedad</b><p>Hadad&#8217;s name, also found in <a href="/genesis/36-35.htm">Genesis 36:35</a> and later in <a href="/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14-22</a>, was common among Edomites and connected to regional deities. By identifying his father Bedad, the text anchors Hadad in a real lineage, mirroring the Bible&#8217;s emphasis on historical accuracy (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-1.htm">1 Chronicles 1:1-34</a>). Genealogies underscore that God works through specific people, not anonymous myths.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who defeated Midian in the country of Moab</b><p>Hadad is remembered for a military victory:<p>&#8226; Midian had once joined Moab to oppose Israel (<a href="/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4-7</a>; 25:17-18).<p>&#8226; Centuries later, Midian oppressed Israel before Gideon&#8217;s triumph (<a href="/bsb/judges/6.htm">Judges 6&#8211;8</a>).<p>Edom&#8217;s conquest here shows that God allows nations to rise and fall, fulfilling His larger purposes (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). The chronicler quietly affirms historical reality: Edom truly bested Midian on Moabite soil.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>reigned in his place.</b><p>Leadership succession highlights stability in Edom before Israel ever had a human king (<a href="/genesis/36-31.htm">Genesis 36:31</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5-7</a>). God&#8217;s Word confirms that earthly thrones exist by His determination (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>). Though Edom did not worship the Lord, its kingship still unfolded under His sovereign timetable, demonstrating that all history remains under divine control.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the name of his city was Avith.</b><p>Avith&#8217;s exact location is lost, yet naming the capital adds geographical concreteness, similar to <a href="/genesis/36-35.htm">Genesis 36:35</a>. Like later Seir, Bozrah, or Petra (<a href="/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>), Avith reminds us these chronicles concern real places. The verse underscores that the chronicler preserved accurate details, trusting that every fact serves God&#8217;s revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/1-46.htm">1 Chronicles 1:46</a> records a seamless transfer of power in Edom from Husham to Hadad, grounding the account in verifiable names, places, and events. Hadad&#8217;s noted victory over Midian in Moab illustrates God&#8217;s ongoing direction of nations, showing that even foreign rulers play roles in His larger redemptive plan. The verse, echoed from <a href="/bsb/genesis/36.htm">Genesis 36</a>, reassures readers that Scripture faithfully preserves historical truth while pointing to the Lord who governs every kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(46) <span class= "bld">Hadad.</span>--The name of a Syrian deity, a form of the sun-god.

Hadad is the same as Dadi, a Syrian title of Rimmon. Perhaps the classical Attis is equivalent to Dadis.
