Jerusalem, known as Salem in the time of Melchizedek (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>), holds a central place in biblical history. David's march signifies the unification of Israel under his rule. This event marks the beginning of Jerusalem's transformation into the political and spiritual center of Israel, foreshadowing its future role in biblical prophecy and as the city of the Great King (<a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>).<p><b>(that is, Jebus),</b><br>Jebus was the ancient name for Jerusalem, inhabited by the Jebusites, a Canaanite tribe. The name Jebus reflects the city's pre-Israelite history. The Jebusites were descendants of Canaan, the son of Ham (<a href="/genesis/10-16.htm">Genesis 10:16</a>). Despite its fortified position, the city was destined to become the capital of Israel. The renaming of Jebus to Jerusalem signifies a new era under David's leadership, aligning with God's covenant promises to Israel.<p><b>where the Jebusites inhabited the land.</b><br>The Jebusites were known for their stronghold in Jerusalem, which they believed to be impregnable (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>). Their presence in the land represents the ongoing challenge Israel faced in fully possessing the Promised Land. The eventual conquest of Jerusalem by David fulfills earlier commands to drive out the inhabitants of Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). This conquest prefigures Christ's ultimate victory over spiritual strongholds, establishing His kingdom in the hearts of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, chosen by God to lead His people.
