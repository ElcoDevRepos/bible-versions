They symbolized wealth, beauty, and divine favor. The mention of "whoever had" indicates a communal effort, where individuals contributed according to their means. This reflects the broader biblical principle of giving willingly and generously, as seen in <a href="/exodus/35-22.htm">Exodus 35:22</a>, where the Israelites brought offerings for the construction of the Tabernacle.<p><b>gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD</b><br>The treasury of the house of the LORD was a designated place for storing valuable items dedicated to God. This act of giving to the treasury signifies dedication and consecration to God's service. It parallels the New Testament teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where Jesus speaks about storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth. The act of giving precious stones to the temple's treasury underscores the importance of prioritizing spiritual wealth over material wealth.<p><b>under the care of Jehiel the Gershonite</b><br>Jehiel, identified as a Gershonite, belonged to the Levitical family of Gershon, one of the three main divisions of the Levites. The Gershonites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and its furnishings (<a href="/numbers/3-25.htm">Numbers 3:25-26</a>). Jehiel's role in overseeing the treasury highlights the trust and responsibility placed upon the Levites in managing the sacred contributions.
