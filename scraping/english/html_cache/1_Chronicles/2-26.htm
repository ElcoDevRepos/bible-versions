The mention of another wife indicates the practice of polygamy, which was common in ancient Israelite culture. This practice is seen in other biblical figures such as Abraham, Jacob, and David. Polygamy often led to familial strife, as seen in the stories of Leah and Rachel or Hannah and Peninnah.<p><b>named Atarah</b><br>The name Atarah means "crown" in Hebrew, which may symbolize honor or status. Names in the Bible often carry significant meaning and can reflect the character or destiny of the person. Atarah's mention by name suggests her importance in Jerahmeel's lineage, although little else is known about her. The naming of women in genealogies is relatively rare, indicating her potential significance.<p><b>who was the mother of Onam</b><br>Onam is listed as a descendant of Jerahmeel, contributing to the genealogical record of the tribe of Judah. The genealogies in Chronicles serve to establish the heritage and tribal affiliations of the Israelites, which were crucial for land inheritance and social identity. Onam's inclusion highlights the continuation of Jerahmeel's line through Atarah, emphasizing the importance of lineage and heritage in biblical narratives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerahmeel.htm">Jerahmeel</a></b><br>A descendant of Judah, Jerahmeel is part of the genealogical record in 1 Chronicles.
