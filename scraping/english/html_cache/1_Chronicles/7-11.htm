The mention of his sons highlights the importance of lineage and family heritage in Israelite society. This reflects the tribal structure of ancient Israel, where family and tribal affiliations were crucial for identity and inheritance. The genealogies in Chronicles emphasize the continuity of God's people and their covenant relationship with Him.<p><b>were heads of their families</b><br>Being heads of their families indicates leadership roles within their clans. In ancient Israel, family heads were responsible for the welfare and spiritual guidance of their households. This role often included making decisions in legal and religious matters, reflecting the patriarchal structure of society. Leadership in the family was seen as a reflection of God's order and authority.<p><b>mighty men of valor</b><br>This phrase denotes their reputation as warriors and their capability in battle. The term "mighty men of valor" is used throughout the Old Testament to describe individuals who demonstrated exceptional bravery and skill in warfare. This highlights the importance of military strength in maintaining the security and stability of the nation. It also reflects the biblical theme of God empowering His people to overcome their enemies.<p><b>there were 17,200 fit for battle</b><br>The specific number of 17,200 indicates a substantial military force, emphasizing the strength and preparedness of Jediael's descendants. This number underscores the importance of being ready for conflict in a time when Israel faced threats from surrounding nations. The precision of the number also reflects the chronicler's attention to detail and the importance of record-keeping in ancient Israel. This readiness for battle can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual preparedness, a theme echoed in the New Testament where believers are called to be spiritually vigilant and equipped.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jediael.htm">Jediael</a></b><br>A descendant of Benjamin, Jediael is noted as the patriarch of a family of warriors.
