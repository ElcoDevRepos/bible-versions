This reflects the structured organization of worship in ancient Israel, emphasizing the importance of music in temple services. Zaccur's name, meaning "mindful" or "remembered," may suggest a role of significance or honor. The appointment of musicians in a specific order highlights the meticulous planning in worship, akin to the order seen in the Levitical priesthood. This structure is reminiscent of the order and harmony found in creation, as seen in Genesis.<p><b>his sons, and his brothers</b><br>The inclusion of both sons and brothers indicates a family-based service, which was common in the Levitical tradition. This familial involvement underscores the hereditary nature of temple duties, ensuring continuity and stability in worship practices. It also reflects the communal aspect of worship, where families served together, fostering unity and shared purpose. This mirrors the New Testament concept of the church as a family of believers, working together for the glory of God.<p><b>12 in all</b><br>The number twelve is significant throughout the Bible, often symbolizing completeness or divine order. It is seen in the twelve tribes of Israel, the twelve apostles, and the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem in Revelation. In this context, the number may represent the completeness of Zaccur's group, fully equipped to fulfill their role in temple worship. This completeness can be seen as a type of the fullness of Christ's body, the church, where each member has a role to play in the worship and service of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zaccur.htm">Zaccur</a></b><br>A leader among the musicians appointed by King David for the service of song in the house of the Lord.
