This division occurred because the tribe settled on both sides of the Jordan River. The eastern half settled in the land of Gilead, while the western half settled in Canaan. This allocation highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to the descendants of Joseph, ensuring they received a significant portion of the Promised Land. The half-tribe of Manasseh's involvement in providing cities to the Levites underscores their role in supporting the religious and spiritual life of Israel.<p><b>the rest of the clans of the Kohathites</b><br>The Kohathites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, descended from Kohath, the second son of Levi. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects, including the Ark of the Covenant, during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings. The "rest of the clans" indicates that this allocation was part of a broader distribution of cities to the Levites, as the Kohathites were spread across different tribal territories. This distribution ensured that the Levites, who had no inheritance of their own, were integrated into the community and could perform their priestly duties.<p><b>were given Aner and Bileam</b><br>Aner and Bileam were cities allocated to the Kohathites from the territory of the half-tribe of Manasseh. These cities, along with their pasturelands, provided the necessary resources for the Levites to sustain themselves and their families. The specific mention of these cities highlights the organized and systematic approach to ensuring the Levites were supported throughout Israel. While the exact locations of Aner and Bileam are not definitively known today, their inclusion in the biblical record emphasizes the historical reality of the Levitical cities.<p><b>together with their pasturelands</b><br>The inclusion of pasturelands was crucial for the Levites, as it provided them with the means to raise livestock and sustain their communities. This provision reflects the practical needs of the Levites, who, unlike other tribes, did not receive a large territorial inheritance. The pasturelands ensured that the Levites could maintain a degree of self-sufficiency while focusing on their religious duties. This arrangement also symbolizes the broader principle of God's provision for those dedicated to His service, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Half-Tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>This refers to one of the two divisions of the tribe of Manasseh, which was one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

After Israel entered Canaan, the tribe of Manasseh was uniquely divided: half settled east of the Jordan (<a href="/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29&#8211;31</a>), and half settled west (<a href="/joshua/17-5.htm">Joshua 17:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; By pointing to &#8220;the half-tribe,&#8221; the writer reminds us that God&#8217;s distribution of territory was precise and purposeful, fulfilling earlier promises (<a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse also reveals God&#8217;s care that even distant or divided clans remained connected to worship through Levite cities (<a href="/joshua/21-8.htm">Joshua 21:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the rest of the clans of the Kohathites</b><p>&#8226; The Kohathites, descendants of Levi through Kohath, held special responsibilities for the most sacred objects in the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/3-27.htm">Numbers 3:27&#8211;32</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-54.htm">1 Chronicles 6:54&#8211;62</a>, several Kohathite clans already received cities. &#8220;The rest&#8221; shows God&#8217;s fairness&#8212;no family is overlooked in His provision.<p>&#8226; This distribution underscores that spiritual service (represented by the Levites) was woven throughout the nation, not centralized only in Jerusalem (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were given Aner and Bileam</b><p>&#8226; Aner and Bileam (also called Taanach and Ibleam in <a href="/joshua/21-25.htm">Joshua 21:25</a>) sat in the rich Jezreel Valley.
