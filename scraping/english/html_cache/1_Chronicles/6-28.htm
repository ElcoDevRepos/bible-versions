His role was pivotal during the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy in Israel. Samuel's leadership and spiritual guidance were crucial in anointing the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David. His sons are mentioned here to establish the genealogical record and to highlight the continuation of his lineage, although they did not follow in his righteous footsteps.<p><b>Joel his firstborn:</b><br>Joel, as the firstborn son of Samuel, would have been expected to inherit his father's responsibilities and spiritual leadership. However, in <a href="/1_samuel/8.htm">1 Samuel 8:1-3</a>, it is noted that Joel, along with his brother, did not walk in Samuel's ways but turned aside after dishonest gain, accepting bribes and perverting justice. This failure in leadership contributed to the people's demand for a king, which led to the anointing of Saul. The name Joel means "Yahweh is God," reflecting the theocentric culture of Israel.<p><b>and Abijah his second son:</b><br>Abijah, Samuel's second son, shares a similar fate with his brother Joel in terms of their moral failings. The name Abijah means "My Father is Yahweh," again emphasizing the religious heritage of Samuel's family. Despite their father's faithfulness, both sons failed to uphold the standards expected of them, illustrating the biblical theme that righteousness is not inherited but must be chosen by each generation. Their actions indirectly set the stage for the rise of the monarchy, as the people sought a king to lead them instead of corrupt judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A significant prophet and judge in Israel, Samuel was dedicated to the Lord by his mother, Hannah, and served under Eli the priest.

This simple phrase roots Samuel firmly in the tribe of Levi (compare <a href="/1_chronicles/6-27.htm">1 Chronicles 6:27</a>) and links his household to the priestly and worship responsibilities God assigned to Levi (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording is factual and literal: Samuel really did have sons, and their names preserve a historical record.<p>&#8226; The mention of Samuel&#8217;s sons also reminds readers of Samuel&#8217;s unique role as prophet, judge, and priest (<a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>; 7:15&#8211;17), underscoring how his family line would naturally draw attention in any Levitical genealogy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joel his firstborn</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Joel his firstborn&#8221; identifies the elder son by name. Being firstborn carried weight in inheritance and leadership among the Israelites (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>), and the chronicler faithfully records this order.<p>&#8226; Cross-references show Joel&#8217;s later life: when Samuel grew old, &#8220;he appointed his sons judges over Israel. The name of his firstborn son was Joel&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-1.htm">1 Samuel 8:1&#8211;2</a>). Sadly, Joel did not walk in his father&#8217;s integrity (<a href="/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The chronicler does not elaborate on Joel&#8217;s failings; he simply states the fact, emphasizing the impartial nature of Scripture&#8217;s genealogies&#8212;recording both honor and, by silence elsewhere, implied shortcomings (compare <a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1&#8211;2</a> concerning Reuben).<p>&#8226; Even with Joel&#8217;s missteps, the inclusion of his name testifies to God&#8217;s commitment to record every link in the covenant line (<a href="/exodus/28-29.htm">Exodus 28:29</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Abijah his second son</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;And Abijah his second son&#8221; notes the younger brother.

The verse quietly reminds us that lineage carries both privilege and responsibility, and that God&#8217;s unfolding story is larger than any one individual&#8212;even the sons of a prophet as great as Samuel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">And</span> <span class= "bld">the sons of Samuel.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">Shemuel</span> The third break in the Kohathite list.<p>We see from <a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-33.htm" title="And these are they that waited with their children.
