The Moabites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, and had a complex relationship with Israel, sometimes hostile and sometimes allied. This victory demonstrates God's favor upon David as king, fulfilling the promise of establishing his kingdom. The Moabites had previously oppressed Israel during the time of the Judges (<a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-30</a>), and this defeat signifies a reversal of fortunes. The Moabites' defeat also aligns with the broader narrative of David's military campaigns, which were instrumental in securing Israel's borders and establishing peace.<p><b>and they became subject to David</b><br>The subjugation of the Moabites under David's rule indicates a shift in regional power dynamics. This subjection involved the Moabites becoming vassals, which meant they were under the authority and protection of Israel, but retained some degree of autonomy. This relationship is reflective of the ancient Near Eastern practice where defeated nations would become tributary states, providing resources and allegiance to the victor. This subjugation is a fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel rest from its enemies (<a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7:1</a>). It also prefigures the ultimate reign of Christ, who will subdue all nations under His rule (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>).<p><b>and brought him tribute</b><br>The tribute brought by the Moabites to David signifies their acknowledgment of his sovereignty and their submission to his rule. Tribute often included valuable goods, such as gold, silver, livestock, or other resources, which would enhance the wealth and stability of David's kingdom. This act of bringing tribute is a common practice in ancient times, symbolizing loyalty and dependence. It also reflects the fulfillment of God's covenant promises to Israel, where other nations would serve them (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-6.htm">Deuteronomy 15:6</a>). In a typological sense, this foreshadows the homage that all nations will bring to Christ in His eternal kingdom (<a href="/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24-26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his military prowess, leadership, and heart for God.

Here the relationship shifts decisively, showing God granting David military success much like earlier triumphs over the Philistines (<a href="/1_chronicles/14-11.htm">1 Chronicles 14:11, 17</a>).<p>&#8226; The chronicler records these events to demonstrate how the kingdom was being firmly established under David, in line with prophecies such as <a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a> that had long foretold boundaries for Israel and her neighbors.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They became subject to David</b><p>&#8211; The next phrase underscores a political outcome: the Moabites &#8220;became subject to David.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This subjection is not merely a truce; it is a recognition of David&#8217;s sovereignty, similar to the submission of the Philistines (<a href="/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>) and Arameans (<a href="/1_chronicles/18-6.htm">1 Chronicles 18:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The move fulfills earlier indications that Israel would lead surrounding nations (<a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant with Abraham promised influence over neighboring peoples (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).

The verse showcases God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant promises, David&#8217;s growing international stature, and a glimpse of the broader reign of the coming Christ in which every nation will ultimately render honor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) Much abridged, as compared with Samuel. After the words "he smote Moab," we read there of a partial massacre of the conquered. The emission is scarcely due to any unfair bias on the part of the chronicler. Indeed, as a Jew, possessed with all the national exclusiveness and hatred of the aliens who always misunderstood and sometimes cruelly oppressed his people, he was not likely to regard the slaughter of captive Moabites from a modern point of view.
