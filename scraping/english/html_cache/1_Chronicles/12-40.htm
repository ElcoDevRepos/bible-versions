Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali were northern tribes, indicating a broad coalition supporting David. This unity is significant in the context of Israel's history, as tribal divisions often led to conflict. The mention of these tribes underscores the widespread acceptance of David's leadership, fulfilling God's promise to unite Israel under a single king.<p><b>came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen</b><br>The transportation methods reflect the agrarian society of ancient Israel, where such animals were essential for carrying goods over long distances. The diversity of animals suggests the abundance and variety of resources available to the Israelites. This logistical support was crucial for sustaining David's growing army and household, demonstrating the people's commitment to his cause.<p><b>abundant supplies of flour, fig cakes and raisin cakes, wine and oil, oxen and sheep</b><br>The provision of these specific items indicates the prosperity and agricultural richness of the land. Flour, fig cakes, and raisin cakes were staple foods, while wine and oil were valuable commodities. Oxen and sheep were not only sources of food but also symbols of wealth and blessing. This abundance reflects God's provision and favor upon David and his followers, reminiscent of the blessings promised to Israel in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>.<p><b>Indeed, there was joy in Israel</b><br>The joy mentioned here signifies more than just happiness; it represents a deep, communal sense of fulfillment and divine blessing. This joy is rooted in the fulfillment of God's promises and the anticipation of a united and prosperous kingdom under David's rule. It echoes the joy found in other biblical celebrations of God's faithfulness, such as the return of the Ark of the Covenant in <a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12-15</a>. This joy foreshadows the ultimate joy found in the reign of Jesus Christ, the descendant of David, who brings spiritual unity and peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/issachar,_zebulun,_and_naphtali.htm">Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali</a></b><br>These are three of the tribes of Israel.

Obedience and generosity produce gladness both for giver and receiver (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The people rejoice that Saul&#8217;s tragic era is over and David, &#8220;a man after God&#8217;s own heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>), is enthroned.<p>&#8226; Their joy prefigures the rejoicing that breaks out when Christ, David&#8217;s greater Son, unites Jew and Gentile into one body (<a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13-18</a>).<p>Genuine joy flows wherever God&#8217;s rightful King is honored.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/12-40.htm">1 Chronicles 12:40</a> records a real, nationwide outpouring of support for David: distant tribes journey south, load beasts with generous food, and celebrate together. Their actions display unity, thoughtful service, wholehearted giving, and resulting joy. In every age, when God&#8217;s people rally around His chosen King and meet each other&#8217;s needs, the same joy still follows.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">They that were nigh them.</span>--The tribes bordering on Judah (LXX. <span class= "greekheb">?? ??????????</span>), and even the northern tribes, contributed provisions.<p><span class= "bld">Brought, </span><span class= "ital">were bringing<span class= "bld">.</span></span><p><span class= "bld">Asses . . . camels . . . mules . . . oxen,</span> but not horses, were the usual beasts of burden in rocky Canaan.<p><span class= "bld">Meat, meal.</span><span class= "ital">--Rather, food of flour.</span><p><span class= "bld">Bunches.</span>--Rather, cakes of raisins; masses of dried figs and raisins were, and are, a staple article of' food i?? the East (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm" title="Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.">1Samuel 25:18</a>; <a href="/amos/8-11.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:">Amos 8:11</a>). The simple diction of the narrative, reminding us of Homer's feasts, is a mark of its ancient origin.<p>1 Chronicles 13-16 form a complete section relating to the transfer of the Ark from Kirjath-jearim to its new sanctuary at Jerusalem. The continuity of the narrative is only suspended by the short parenthetic 1 Chronicles 14. 1 Chronicles 13 is closely parallel to <a href="/context/2_samuel/6-1.htm" title="Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.">2Samuel 6:1-11</a>. The introduction, however (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/12-1.htm" title="Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.">1Chronicles 12:1-5</a>), is much fuller than that of Samuel, which is condensed into one brief sentence. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover, they that were nigh them</span>. The meaning is that not only the "brethren" of Judah and of the nearer neighbourhood of Hebron joined to entertain and to show hospitality to the immense throngs of visitors, but that others did so in ever-widening circles, even as far as the remoter Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali. For there was joy in Israel. The joy must have been largely enhanced by the national consciousness of divided rule coming to an end, and of the cloud and frown of the Divine countenance having cleared mercifully away. All now could join to show loyalty and to feel it towards one king, of whom they had reason to believe that he was the chosen of God as of themselves. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/12-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And their neighbors</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
