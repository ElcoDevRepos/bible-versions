The Levites were set apart for religious duties and the care of the tabernacle, and later the temple. The Merarites were specifically responsible for the framework of the tabernacle, including the pillars, bases, and other structural elements. This division of labor among the Levites highlights the organized and communal nature of Israelite worship, emphasizing the importance of each group in maintaining the sacred space.<p><b>Asaiah the chief</b><br>Asaiah is identified as the leader of the Merarites in this context. The role of a chief or leader among the Levites was significant, as it involved overseeing the duties and ensuring that the commands regarding worship and the care of the tabernacle were followed. Leadership in the Levitical context was not just administrative but also spiritual, as it required a deep understanding of the law and a commitment to holiness. Asaiah's leadership would have been crucial in the process of bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, a pivotal moment in Israel's religious history.<p><b>and 220 of his relatives</b><br>The mention of 220 relatives indicates the large number of Levites involved in the religious activities and the transportation of the Ark. This number reflects the communal and familial nature of Levitical service, where extended family units worked together in their sacred duties. The involvement of such a large group underscores the importance of the event and the collective effort required to honor God properly. It also highlights the hereditary nature of the Levitical priesthood, where roles and responsibilities were passed down through family lines, ensuring continuity in worship practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/merarites.htm">Merarites</a></b><br>One of the three main divisions of the Levites, descended from Merari, the son of Levi.

His descendants formed one of the three great Levitical clans alongside the Gershonites and Kohathites (<a href="/numbers/3-17.htm">Numbers 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; God assigned the Merarites the task of transporting the heavy framework of the tabernacle&#8212;boards, bars, pillars, and bases (<a href="/numbers/4-29.htm">Numbers 4:29-33</a>). This background shows why David needed them when moving the ark.<p>&#8226; Earlier, a careless attempt to relocate the ark ended in tragedy (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>). Now David obeys the law by summoning the proper Levitical families, including the Merarites, just as Moses had once done in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/3-36.htm">Numbers 3:36-37</a>).<p>&#8226; Their inclusion underscores that every detail of God&#8217;s instructions matters, a theme echoed later when Ezra again depends on the Merarites for temple service (<a href="/ezra/8-18.htm">Ezra 8:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Asaiah the chief</b><p>&#8220;from the Merarites, Asaiah the chief&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Chief&#8221; identifies Asaiah as the recognized head of his clan, similar to how Chenaniah was chief of the Levite music (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-22.htm">1 Chronicles 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; David gathers several such leaders&#8212;Uriel, Shemaiah, Eliel, Aminadab, and Asaiah&#8212;to organize the task (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-5.htm">1 Chronicles 15:5-10</a>). This structure reflects <a href="/numbers/3-32.htm">Numbers 3:32</a>, where Eleazar supervised the chiefs of the Levites.<p>&#8226; Asaiah&#8217;s presence signals willing submission to God-ordained order. Leadership in Israel was never merely political; it was covenantal (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-2.htm">1 Chronicles 23:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming Asaiah, the writer affirms God&#8217;s care for individuals, not just crowds&#8212;an encouragement echoed in the way <a href="/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a> lists church leaders by name.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and 220 of his relatives</b><p>&#8220;and 220 of his relatives&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6</a>)<p>&#8226; The number is precise, matching the careful tallies found throughout Chronicles (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3-5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-12.htm">2 Chronicles 26:12</a>). Scripture records real history, not vague legend.<p>&#8226; These 220 men joined kin from other clans&#8212;Kohathites (120), Gershonites (130), Elizaphanites (200), Hebronites (80), and Uzzielites (112)&#8212;totaling 862 Levites (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-5.htm">1 Chronicles 15:5-10</a>). The size of the assembly highlights the national importance of returning the ark.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Relatives&#8221; or &#8220;brothers&#8221; (BSB margin) emphasizes unity. Each clan served side-by-side, prefiguring the New Testament picture of the body of Christ, where every member supplies what the others need (<a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Their readiness to serve reflects Moses&#8217; charge that the Levites &#8220;minister before the LORD continually&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-30.htm">1 Chronicles 23:30-32</a>). Immediate obedience replaces the earlier negligence that caused Uzzah&#8217;s death (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-9.htm">1 Chronicles 13:9-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6</a> spotlights the Merarite clan, led by Asaiah, with 220 kinsmen eagerly responding to David&#8217;s call. The verse affirms God&#8217;s meticulous ordering of worship: the right people, in the right roles, at the right time. Each name and number testifies to Scripture&#8217;s historical accuracy and to the Lord&#8217;s desire for reverent, obedient service among His people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">from the Merarites,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7687;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Asaiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6222.htm">Strong's 6222: </a> </span><span class="str2">Asaiah -- four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the chief</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8269.htm">Strong's 8269: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chieftain, chief, ruler, official, captain, prince</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and 220</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#7791;a&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - fd<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3967.htm">Strong's 3967: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hundred</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his relatives;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1430;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_251.htm">Strong's 251: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brother, )</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">1 Chronicles 15:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_chronicles/15-6.htm">OT History: 1 Chronicles 15:6 Of the sons of Merari Asaiah (1 Chron. 1Ch iCh i Ch 1 chr 1chr)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/1_chronicles/15-5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 15:5"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 15:5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/1_chronicles/15-7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 15:7"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 15:7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
