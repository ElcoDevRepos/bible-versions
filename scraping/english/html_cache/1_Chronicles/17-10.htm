This era began after the death of Joshua and continued until the establishment of the monarchy with Saul. The judges were leaders raised by God to deliver Israel from oppression and to guide them spiritually and politically. This period is marked by a cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance, as recorded in the Book of Judges. The appointment of judges signifies God's direct involvement in the leadership of Israel, emphasizing His sovereignty and care for His people. This historical context highlights the transition from a theocratic system to a monarchy, setting the stage for the Davidic covenant.<p><b>And I will subdue all your enemies.</b><br>This promise of subduing enemies is a reassurance of divine protection and victory. Throughout Israel's history, they faced numerous adversaries, including the Philistines, Moabites, and Ammonites. God's promise to subdue these enemies underscores His role as a divine warrior and protector of Israel. This assurance is not only a promise of physical victory but also a spiritual one, foreshadowing the ultimate defeat of sin and death through Jesus Christ. The subduing of enemies can be seen as a type of Christ's victory over spiritual adversaries, as referenced in passages like <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>, where Christ disarms the powers and authorities.<p><b>Moreover, I declare to you that the LORD will build a house for you.</b><br>This declaration is a pivotal moment in the Davidic covenant, where God promises to establish David's dynasty. The "house" refers not to a physical building but to a lasting lineage and kingdom. This promise is fulfilled in the establishment of the Davidic line, culminating in the birth of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David. The concept of God building a house for David contrasts with David's desire to build a temple for God, highlighting God's initiative and grace. This covenantal promise is foundational for understanding the messianic hope in the Old Testament, as it points to the eternal kingdom established through Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>, where the angel Gabriel announces to Mary that her son will inherit the throne of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, to whom God is speaking through the prophet Nathan.

This whole clause should not have been separated from <a href="/1_chronicles/17-9.htm" title="Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,">1Chronicles 17:9</a>, which it properly concludes. The allusion is to the oppressions undergone in the period of the judges, and the troubles of the former reign.<p><span class= "bld">Moreover </span>(and)<span class= "bld"> I will subdue all thine enemies.</span>--A continuation of the promises at the beginning of <a href="/1_chronicles/17-9.htm" title="Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,">1Chronicles 17:9</a>. "I will subdue the foes of the king, as I subdued the foes of the shepherd and the outlaw." (Comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/17-8.htm" title="And I have been with you wherever you have walked, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.">1Chronicles 17:8</a>.) Instead of this, Samuel has, "And I will give thee rest from all thy enemies."<p><span class= "bld">Furthermore I tell thee</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And I have told thee, and a house will Jehovah build thee;"</span> that is, I have foretold it. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/40-21.htm" title="Have you not known? have you not heard? has it not been told you from the beginning? have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?">Isaiah 40:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-21.htm" title="Tell you, and bring them near; yes, let them take counsel together: who has declared this from ancient time? who has told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Savior; there is none beside me.">Isaiah 45:21</a>.) That which follows is a sort of ironical inversion of David's wish to build a house for the Lord. The term "house" is figurative (offspring), as in <a href="/psalms/127-1.htm" title="Except the LORD build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman wakes but in vain.">Psalm 127:1</a>. (Comp. <a href="/genesis/30-3.htm" title="And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear on my knees, that I may also have children by her.">Genesis 30:3</a>.) The reading of Samuel is, "And Jehovah hath [now] told thee [by my mouth] that a house will Jehovah make for thee." This looks original, with its rare construction of the perfect, which the chronicler has altered; its repetition of the most holy Name; and its less exact "make," which Chronicles improves into "build," with an eye to <a href="/1_chronicles/17-4.htm" title="Go and tell David my servant, Thus said the LORD, You shall not build me an house to dwell in:">1Chronicles 17:4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/17-6.htm" title="Wherever I have walked with all Israel, spoke I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have you not built me an house of cedars?">1Chronicles 17:6</a>, as well as to the play on the word (<span class= "ital">b?n?h,</span> build; <span class= "ital">b?nim,</span> sons). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - This verse should read on continuously with the preceding, as far as to the word "enemies."
