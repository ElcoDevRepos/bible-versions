This moment of confession is reminiscent of other biblical figures who spoke directly to God, such as Moses and Abraham. It underscores the importance of direct communication with God in times of sin and repentance.<p><b>&#8220;I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing.</b><br>David acknowledges the gravity of his sin, which in this context refers to his decision to conduct a census of Israel. This act was seen as a lack of trust in God's ability to sustain and protect Israel without reliance on military strength. The admission of sin is a crucial step in the process of repentance, as seen in other biblical narratives like <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>, where David also confesses his sin with Bathsheba.<p><b>Now I beg You to take away the iniquity of Your servant,</b><br>David's plea for forgiveness reflects the biblical principle that only God can remove sin. The term "iniquity" denotes a deep moral failing, and David's use of "Your servant" shows his humility and recognition of his position before God. This request for divine mercy is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to seek forgiveness through Christ (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<p><b>for I have acted very foolishly.&#8221;</b><br>David's admission of foolishness is an acknowledgment of his lack of wisdom and discernment. In biblical terms, foolishness often contrasts with the wisdom that comes from fearing the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of human fallibility and the need for divine guidance, as seen in the lives of other leaders like Solomon, who asked God for wisdom to lead his people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who ordered a census of the fighting men, an act that was against God's will and led to his repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Almighty, who is approached by David in repentance after realizing his sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/census.htm">Census</a></b><br>The event that triggered God's displeasure, as it demonstrated David's reliance on military strength rather than on God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation affected by David's actions, as the census was conducted across the tribes of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance.htm">Repentance</a></b><br>The act of David acknowledging his sin and seeking God's forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_gravity_of_sin.htm">The Gravity of Sin</a></b><br>David acknowledges his sin as "great," reminding us that sin is serious and has consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance.htm">The Importance of Repentance</a></b><br>David's immediate response to his sin is to seek God's forgiveness, illustrating the importance of a repentant heart.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reliance_on_god.htm">Reliance on God</a></b><br>The census was a demonstration of misplaced trust in human strength rather than in God's provision and protection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_mercy.htm">God's Mercy</a></b><br>Despite the gravity of David's sin, he appeals to God's mercy, which is a central theme in the Christian faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/learning_from_mistakes.htm">Learning from Mistakes</a></b><br>David's experience teaches us to learn from our errors and to seek God's guidance in all decisions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Chronicles_21_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Chronicles 21:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_David_confess_his_great_sin.htm">Why did David say, "I have sinned greatly" in 1 Chronicles 21:8?

David&#8217;s immediate address underscores that genuine restoration always begins with conversation with God (<a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have sinned greatly</b><p>&#8226; Unlike soft or partial confessions, David labels his failure &#8220;great.&#8221; Comparable admissions appear in <a href="/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3&#8211;4</a>, where he says, &#8220;For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently teaches that minimizing sin hinders forgiveness (<a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8&#8211;9</a>). David&#8217;s candid wording shows awareness of sin&#8217;s seriousness before a holy God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because I have done this thing</b><p>&#8226; He names the act: ordering the census. By identifying the specific wrongdoing, David avoids vague repentance.

True wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), and sin is the abandonment of that fear.<p>&#8226; By labeling his choice &#8220;very foolish,&#8221; he highlights that self-reliance is spiritual stupidity. Similar language is used of Saul in <a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13</a>, warning that even God&#8217;s anointed are accountable.<p>&#8226; Confession reaches depth when we see sin not only as wrong but as foolish, destructive, and senseless (<a href="/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a>; <a href="/titus/3-3.htm">Titus 3:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/21-8.htm">1 Chronicles 21:8</a> records David&#8217;s wholehearted confession after a pride-driven census.
