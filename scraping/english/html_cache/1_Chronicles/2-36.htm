The genealogies serve to establish the historical and covenantal continuity of God's people. Attai's mention highlights the importance of every link in the chain of ancestry leading to the Davidic line. The name Attai means "timely" or "my time," which may reflect the providential timing of his role in the lineage. This phrase underscores the biblical theme that God uses ordinary people to fulfill His divine purposes.<p><b>Nathan was the father of Zabad</b><br>Nathan, in this context, is not to be confused with the prophet Nathan who advised King David. This Nathan is part of the genealogical record that connects to the broader narrative of Israel's history. The name Nathan means "he gave" or "gift," which can symbolize the blessings and gifts of God passed through generations. Zabad, meaning "endowed" or "gift," continues this theme of divine provision and blessing. This lineage, while not directly linked to the messianic line, reflects the broader tapestry of God's work through His people. The genealogies in Chronicles often emphasize the faithfulness of God in preserving His people and fulfilling His promises, even through seemingly obscure individuals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/attai.htm">Attai</a></b><br>A descendant of Judah, Attai is part of the genealogical record that traces the lineage of the tribe of Judah.

The union underscores God&#8217;s sovereign ability to preserve Judah&#8217;s line even when a family lacks male heirs.<p>&#8226; The literal record affirms that bloodlines matter to the Lord; He traces every generation without error (cf. <a href="/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-64.htm">Nehemiah 7:64</a>).<p>&#8226; Attai&#8217;s mixed heritage shows that covenant grace can bring outsiders fully into Israel, foreshadowing Rahab (<a href="/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>) and Ruth (<a href="/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13-22</a>).<p>&#8226; By placing Attai in the Judah genealogy, the Spirit quietly reminds us that God notices &#8220;hidden&#8221; figures as much as well-known patriarchs (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nathan was the father of Zabad</b><p>&#8220;Nathan was the father of Zabad&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-36.htm">1 Chronicles 2:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Nathan carries forward the fragile branch begun with Attai. His inclusion validates the promise that &#8220;not one of His words falls to the ground&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Though not the prophet who confronted David (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12</a>) nor David&#8217;s son Nathan (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>), his name still evokes God-given leadership.
