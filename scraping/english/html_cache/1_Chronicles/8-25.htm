The name itself means "Yahweh will redeem" or "Yahweh redeems," which reflects a common theme in Hebrew names that emphasize God's redemptive power. This name is not widely mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, indicating that Iphdeiah may not have been a prominent figure in biblical narratives. However, the inclusion of his name in the genealogies underscores the importance of each individual in the lineage of Israel, highlighting the value placed on family heritage and continuity within the tribes.<p><b>and Penuel</b><br>Penuel, meaning "face of God," is a name that carries significant biblical resonance. It is reminiscent of the place where Jacob wrestled with God and saw Him face to face, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>. This connection may suggest a spiritual heritage or aspiration within the family line. The name Penuel also appears in other contexts, such as a city in the territory of Gad, which was fortified by Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>). The recurrence of this name in various forms throughout the Bible indicates its cultural and spiritual significance.<p><b>were the sons of Shashak</b><br>Shashak is listed as a descendant of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The genealogies in 1 Chronicles serve to establish the historical and familial context of the tribes, particularly after the Babylonian exile when re-establishing identity was crucial. The mention of Shashak and his sons, including Iphdeiah and Penuel, contributes to the broader narrative of the tribe of Benjamin's restoration and continuity. This lineage emphasizes the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs regarding the multiplication and endurance of their descendants. The genealogical records also serve to connect the post-exilic community with their ancestral past, reinforcing their identity as God's chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ibneiah.htm">Ibneiah</a></b><br>A descendant of Benjamin, mentioned in the genealogical records of the tribe.

Although Scripture records nothing further about him, his presence in the inspired genealogy reminds us that God values every name, even when human history forgets it (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Genealogies in Scripture verify God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant promises; every recorded individual, famous or obscure, serves as a link in the chain that leads ultimately to Christ (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-1.htm">1 Chronicles 9:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; By including Iphdeiah, the text underscores that no believer is insignificant in God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Penuel</b><p>&#8226; Penuel, sharing his father Shashak with Iphdeiah, bears a name that echoes the place where Jacob wrestled with the Angel of the LORD (<a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>). That earlier event marked a turning point in Israel&#8217;s history; here, the repetition of the name within Benjamin&#8217;s line signals continuity in God&#8217;s dealings with His people.<p>&#8226; Later, a town called Penuel appears in Gideon&#8217;s story (<a href="/judges/8-8.htm">Judges 8:8&#8211;17</a>), further illustrating how names and locations in Scripture often recur to highlight God&#8217;s ongoing work through generations.<p>&#8226; Together, Iphdeiah and Penuel represent brothers raised within the covenant community, embodying the biblical pattern of sibling partnership in God&#8217;s purposes (<a href="/exodus/4-14.htm">Exodus 4:14</a> &#8211; 15; <a href="/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were the sons</b><p>&#8226; The phrase affirms biological descent, rooting these men firmly within Benjamin&#8217;s tribe (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1</a>). In biblical thought, sonship carries rights, responsibilities, and covenant blessings (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>; <a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Identifying them explicitly as sons stresses legitimate lineage, reinforcing the historical reliability of the chronicler&#8217;s record (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-1.htm">1 Chronicles 6:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the wording foreshadows the New Testament truth that believers become &#8220;sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26</a>), heirs together with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Shashak</b><p>&#8226; Shashak appears in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-23.htm">1 Chronicles 8:23</a> as a chief among Benjamin&#8217;s descendants. Mentioning him again in verse 25 highlights the structure of the clan and affirms his standing.<p>&#8226; His name forms a branch in the larger family tree that stretches back to Benjamin and ultimately to Jacob, anchoring Israel&#8217;s identity (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-14.htm">1 Chronicles 8:14&#8211;40</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse&#8217;s precise placement between the families of Beriah and Jeroham (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-24.htm">1 Chronicles 8:24&#8211;27</a>) shows the chronicler&#8217;s concern for order, echoing God&#8217;s own orderly nature (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/8-25.htm">1 Chronicles 8:25</a>&#8212;&#8220;Iphdeiah and Penuel were the sons of Shashak&#8221;&#8212;may seem like a simple genealogical note, yet it proclaims profound truths. God records individual names because each life matters to Him; He weaves ordinary people into His extraordinary redemptive story. The verse reaffirms the legitimacy of Benjamin&#8217;s line, testifies to God&#8217;s faithfulness across generations, and hints at the greater sonship offered in Christ. Even the briefest scriptural detail invites us to marvel at God&#8217;s meticulous care and unwavering covenant love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/8-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Iphdeiah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1491;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;yip&#772;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3301.htm">Strong's 3301: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iphedeiah -- 'Yah will ransom', an Israelite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Penuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;n&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6439.htm">Strong's 6439: </a> </span><span class="str2">Penuel -- 'face of God', a place East of the Jordan, also two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[were] the sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Shashak.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1469;&#1511;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8349.htm">Strong's 8349: </a> </span><span class="str2">Shashak -- a Benjamite</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/1_chronicles/8-25.htm">1 Chronicles 8:25 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/1_chronicles/8-25.htm">1 Chronicles 8:25 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/1_chronicles/8-25.htm">1 Chronicles 8:25 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/1_chronicles/8-25.htm">1 Chronicles 8:25 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/1_chronicles/8-25.htm">1 Chronicles 8:25 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/1_chronicles/8-25.htm">1 Chronicles 8:25  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/1_chronicles/8-25.htm">1 Chronicles 8:25 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/1_chronicles/8-25.htm">1 Chronicles 8:25 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/1_chronicles/8-25.htm">1 Chronicles 8:25 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/1_chronicles/8-25.htm">1 Chronicles 8:25 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_chronicles/8-25.htm">OT History: 1 Chronicles 8:25 And Iphdeiah and Penuel the sons (1 Chron. 1Ch iCh i Ch 1 chr 1chr)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/1_chronicles/8-24.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 8:24"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 8:24" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/1_chronicles/8-26.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 8:26"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 8:26" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
