In the ancient Near East, deities were often associated with temples, but the God of Israel emphasizes His transcendence and freedom from human constraints. This reflects His omnipresence and sovereignty, distinguishing Him from the gods of surrounding nations who were believed to be confined to temples.<p><b>from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt</b><br>This refers to the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing God's deliverance and covenant faithfulness. It underscores God's active role in Israel's formation as a nation. The Exodus is frequently referenced throughout Scripture as a demonstration of God's power and commitment to His people, serving as a type of Christ's redemptive work.<p><b>until this day</b><br>This phrase indicates the continuity of God's presence with Israel throughout their history, from the Exodus to the time of David. It emphasizes God's unchanging nature and His ongoing relationship with His people, despite their frequent disobedience and the passage of time.<p><b>but I have moved from tent to tent</b><br>The use of tents signifies the temporary and mobile nature of God's dwelling among His people. The tabernacle, a tent-like structure, was the center of worship and symbolized God's presence during Israel's wilderness wanderings. This mobility allowed God to accompany Israel on their journey, highlighting His willingness to be with them wherever they went.<p><b>and dwelling to dwelling</b><br>This phrase reinforces the idea of God's presence being adaptable and not confined to a single location. It suggests a dynamic relationship with His people, where God meets them in various circumstances and places. This foreshadows the New Testament revelation of God dwelling among humanity in the person of Jesus Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), and later, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His presence and guidance with the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel at the time, who desires to build a permanent house (temple) for God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation God brought out of Egypt, whom He has been leading and dwelling among.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place of bondage from which God delivered the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle (Tent)</a></b><br>The temporary dwelling place of God among His people during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_is_not_limited_by_structures.htm">God's Presence is Not Limited by Structures</a></b><br>God emphasizes that He has not been confined to a physical building, highlighting His omnipresence and sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey_of_faith.htm">The Journey of Faith</a></b><br>Just as God moved with the Israelites, our faith journey involves movement and change, trusting in God's guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_through_transitions.htm">God's Faithfulness Through Transitions</a></b><br>Despite the lack of a permanent structure, God remained faithful to His people, reminding us of His steadfastness in our own life transitions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_temporary_vs._the_eternal.htm">The Temporary vs. The Eternal</a></b><br>The temporary nature of the Tabernacle points to the eternal dwelling we have with God through Christ, encouraging us to focus on eternal values.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_initiative_in_relationship.htm">God's Initiative in Relationship</a></b><br>God initiated the relationship with Israel, moving with them, which reflects His desire for a personal relationship with us today.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Chronicles_17_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Chronicles 17:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Chr_17_5_God_s_presence_beyond_walls.htm">How does 1 Chronicles 17:5 highlight God's presence beyond physical structures?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_dwell_in_a_tent.htm">Why did God choose to dwell in a tent, according to 1 Chronicles 17:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_Chr_17_5_to_God_s_guidance_in_Ex.htm">How does 1 Chronicles 17:5 connect to God's guidance in Exodus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/God_s_nature_in_1_Chron_17_5.htm">What can we learn about God's nature from His dwelling choice in 1 Chronicles 17:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Prioritize_God_over_buildings.htm">How can we prioritize God's presence over physical buildings in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_didn_t_God_dwell_in_a_house_2.htm">Why did God choose not to dwell in a house according to 1 Chronicles 17:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Chron_17_5_God_s_bond_with_Israel.htm">How does 1 Chronicles 17:5 reflect God's relationship with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_God_dwell_in_a_tent.htm">What is the significance of God dwelling in a tent in 1 Chronicles 17:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_chronicles_17.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Chronicles 17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/contradictions_in_1_samuel_4_on_eli's_sons.htm">Are there any contradictions between 1 Samuel 4 and other biblical accounts regarding the fate of Eli's sons or the Ark's movements?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/israel's_fighting_men_count.htm">How many fighting men were in Israel?

The phrase <span class= "ital">"</span>and I became" almost demands a participle, and the one actually read in Samuel may be here disguised under the expression translated "from tent." A slight further change (in the prepositions) will give the sense: "And I continued walking in a tent and in a dwelling." Perhaps, however, the original text was, "and I walked from tent to tent, and from dwelling to dwelling;" alluding to the various sanctuaries anciently recognised, such as Bethel (<a href="/judges/20-18.htm" title="And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.">Judges 20:18</a>; <a href="/judges/20-26.htm" title="Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.">Judges 20:26</a>), Mizpeh (<a href="/judges/11-11.htm" title="Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.">Judges 11:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-17.htm" title="And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;">1Samuel 10:17</a>), and Shiloh. The word "dwelling" (<span class= "ital">mishk?n</span>) is a more general term than tent. It includes the sacred tent and its surrounding court.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - This verse contains the three terms - <span class="cmt_word">house, tent, tabernacle</span> (see notes on 1 Chronicles 16:1). Gesenius observes that when the Hebrew of the last two words is used distinctively, the tent describes the outer coverings of the twelve curtains; and the tabernacle, the ten inner curtains and framework as well, in other words, the whole equipment of the well-known tabernacle. As compared with the version we have here, the parallel place speaks an almost pathetic condescension, "I was a shifting traveller in tent and tabernacle." God meant to remind David how surely and faithfully he had shared the pilgrim lot and unsettledness of his people. What most holy the tabernacle contained was herein a type of the bodily tabernacle of Jesus Christ in later times. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/17-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">dwelt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1433;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#353;a&#7687;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3427.htm">Strong's 3427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit down, to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in a house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7687;a&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
