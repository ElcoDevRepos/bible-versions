The Levites were set apart for religious duties and service in the tabernacle, and later the temple. The Merarites specifically were responsible for the care and transportation of the tabernacle's structural components, such as the frames, bars, pillars, and bases. This division of labor among the Levites highlights the organized and communal nature of Israelite worship and service to God. The mention of "according to their clans" indicates the importance of family lineage and tribal affiliation in ancient Israel, which was crucial for maintaining order and fulfilling God&#8217;s commands regarding the priesthood and temple service.<p><b>were allotted twelve cities</b><br>The allocation of cities to the Levites, including the Merarites, was a fulfillment of God's command to provide for the Levites, who did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. Instead, they were given cities to dwell in, along with surrounding pasturelands for their livestock. This arrangement ensured that the Levites were distributed throughout Israel, allowing them to perform their religious duties and teach the Law to the people. The number twelve is significant in biblical numerology, often representing completeness or divine order, which may symbolize the comprehensive provision for the Levites' needs.<p><b>from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun</b><br>The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun were among the twelve tribes of Israel, each with its own distinct territory. Reuben and Gad were located east of the Jordan River, while Zebulun was situated in the northern part of Canaan. The distribution of cities from these tribes to the Merarites reflects the broader integration of the Levites into the life of the nation, ensuring their presence and influence across different regions. This allocation also underscores the unity and interdependence among the tribes, as they collectively supported the Levites in their spiritual and communal roles. The geographical spread of these cities facilitated the Levites' mission to teach and uphold the covenantal laws throughout Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_merari.htm">Sons of Merari</a></b><br>One of the three main divisions of the Levites, descendants of Merari, the third son of Levi.
