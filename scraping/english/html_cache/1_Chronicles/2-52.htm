His lineage is significant in the genealogical records of the tribe of Judah, which is the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ descended. Shobal's mention here highlights the importance of family lineage in the biblical narrative, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promises through specific family lines.<p><b>the father of Kiriath-jearim</b><br>Kiriath-jearim was a significant city in the tribal territory of Judah, located near the border with Benjamin. It is historically important as the place where the Ark of the Covenant was kept for a time before being moved to Jerusalem by King David (<a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>). The city's name means "City of Forests," indicating its geographical setting. Shobal being called the "father" of Kiriath-jearim suggests he was a founder or leader of the city, which was a common way to denote leadership or establishment in ancient times.<p><b>Haroeh</b><br>Haroeh is a name that appears in the genealogical records, but little is known about him outside of this context. The name itself means "the seer" or "the visionary," which could imply a role of spiritual or prophetic significance, although this is speculative. The inclusion of Haroeh in the genealogy underscores the detailed record-keeping of the Israelites and their emphasis on preserving family histories.<p><b>half the Manahathites</b><br>The Manahathites were a group or clan within the tribe of Judah. The reference to "half" the Manahathites suggests a division within the clan, possibly indicating a split in territory or leadership. This division could reflect historical or familial circumstances that led to the separation of the group. The mention of the Manahathites connects to the broader narrative of the tribes of Israel and their complex interrelations, which are often detailed in the genealogies to show the fulfillment of God's covenant promises through diverse and sometimes divided family lines.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shobal.htm">Shobal</a></b><br>A descendant of Judah, Shobal is noted as the father of Kiriath-jearim, a significant city in the tribal territory of Judah.
