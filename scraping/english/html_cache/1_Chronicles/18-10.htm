Hadoram, the son of King Tou, was sent to King David, highlighting the importance of the message. This act reflects the diplomatic practices of the time, where royal family members often served as ambassadors. The sending of Hadoram signifies Tou's acknowledgment of David's growing power and influence in the region.<p><b>and bless him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer</b><br>The blessing from Tou to David for defeating Hadadezer underscores the political dynamics of the time. Hadadezer was a powerful king of Zobah, and his defeat by David would have shifted the balance of power. This victory not only expanded David's territory but also secured peace with neighboring kingdoms like Tou's. The blessing can be seen as an acknowledgment of God's favor upon David, aligning with the biblical theme of divine support for Israel's king.<p><b>who had been at war with Tou</b><br>The mention of Hadadezer being at war with Tou provides historical context for the alliances and conflicts in the region. This conflict would have made Tou more inclined to seek peace with David, who had proven himself a formidable military leader. The defeat of a common enemy often led to alliances, as seen here, where Tou seeks to establish friendly relations with David.<p><b>Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze</b><br>The gifts of gold, silver, and bronze were typical of tribute offerings in the ancient world, symbolizing wealth, honor, and submission. These materials were highly valued and often used in the construction of temples and palaces. The offering of such articles to David not only signifies Tou's respect and desire for peace but also foreshadows the wealth that David would accumulate for the future building of the Temple by his son Solomon. This act of bringing tribute is reminiscent of the Magi bringing gifts to Jesus, symbolizing recognition of divine favor and kingship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hadoram.htm">Hadoram</a></b><br>The son of King Tou, sent to King David to convey greetings and blessings.

Tou sends his own son as an ambassador, greets and blesses David, and offers valuable tribute. Each detail highlights the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness to exalt His anointed, draw the nations, and gather resources for His purposes. The verse anticipates the ultimate reign of Christ, when all kings will bring their glory to Him and live in the peace secured by His victories.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">He</span> <span class= "bld">sent.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">and he sent.</span><p><span class= "bld">Hadoram.</span>--Samuel, "and Toi sent Joram" (LXX., "Jedd?ram").
