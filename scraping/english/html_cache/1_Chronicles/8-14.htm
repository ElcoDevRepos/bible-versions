The name Ahio means "brotherly" or "his brother," which reflects the importance of family and kinship in ancient Israelite culture. Ahio is also mentioned in other parts of the Bible, such as in <a href="/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3-4</a>, where he is involved in transporting the Ark of the Covenant. This connection highlights the significance of the Benjamite lineage in the religious and national history of Israel.<p><b>Shashak</b><br>Shashak is another descendant of Benjamin listed in this genealogical account. The name Shashak is less common in the biblical text, and not much is known about him outside of this context. The inclusion of Shashak in the genealogy underscores the chronicler's intent to provide a comprehensive record of the Benjamite lineage, emphasizing the tribe's role in the broader narrative of Israel. This meticulous recording of names serves to preserve the heritage and identity of the tribes of Israel, which was crucial for maintaining the covenant community.<p><b>Jeremoth</b><br>Jeremoth is also listed among the descendants of Benjamin. The name Jeremoth appears several times in the Old Testament, associated with different individuals, which can sometimes lead to confusion. In this context, Jeremoth is part of the genealogical record, contributing to the chronicler's goal of documenting the lineage of the tribe of Benjamin. The repetition of names like Jeremoth in various genealogies highlights the commonality of certain names and the importance of distinguishing individuals through their familial connections. This practice reflects the cultural emphasis on ancestry and the continuity of family lines in ancient Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahio.htm">Ahio</a></b><br>A descendant of Benjamin, mentioned in the genealogies of the tribe.

The writer is showing how Benjamin&#8217;s clan not only survived exile and warfare but actually pushed back Philistine influence.<p>&#8226; Ahio&#8217;s name also appears later in the same genealogy connected with Saul&#8217;s household (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-37.htm">1 Chronicles 9:37</a>). That echo links him to the future king, underscoring how the Lord was preserving a royal line long before it rose to prominence.<p>&#8226; The fact that Scripture records him by name&#8212;without head-turning exploits&#8212;reminds us that God values every faithful member of His covenant family. Compare the quiet listings in <a href="/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a> or <a href="/romans/16-13.htm">Romans 16:13</a> for the same principle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shashak</b><p>&#8226; Shashak shows up twice in this chapter (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-14.htm">1 Chronicles 8:14, 25</a>). His repeated mention signals a branching of the family tree that would produce multiple clan leaders. The chronicler is careful to mark each branch so later generations can trace God&#8217;s unfolding promises.<p>&#8226; The positioning of his name between Ahio and Jeremoth places him right in the middle of a trio&#8212;an arrangement that often highlights balance or completeness in biblical lists (see the threefold pattern of <a href="/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2-4</a> or <a href="/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Though we have no recorded deeds, his inclusion testifies that every household had a role in securing the territory Benjamin held, just as <a href="/bsb/nehemiah/3.htm">Nehemiah 3</a> lists ordinary families who rebuilt Jerusalem&#8217;s wall.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jeremoth</b><p>&#8226; Jeremoth closes the verse and functions as a bridge to the following names in verses 15-28, where several bear the same name. By repeating certain names, the chronicler stresses continuity from one generation to the next, much like the recurring &#8220;Obed&#8221; in <a href="/ruth/4-17.htm">Ruth 4:17, 22</a>.<p>&#8226; Other men named Jeremoth surface in temple service (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-23.htm">1 Chronicles 23:23</a>; 25:4) and military duty (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-18.htm">2 Chronicles 11:18</a>). Those later references show how Benjamin&#8217;s lines diversified into worship and warfare, fulfilling Moses&#8217; blessing that Benjamin would &#8220;dwell securely by Him&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Seeing Jeremoth here, before any of those future roles unfold, assures us that God already knows the paths He has prepared for His people (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/8-14.htm">1 Chronicles 8:14</a> may read like a simple roll call, yet in naming Ahio, Shashak, and Jeremoth the Spirit highlights three truths: God faithfully preserves every branch of His covenant family, He weaves those branches into His redemptive plan long before their public moment arrives, and He records even the quiet lives to prove that none of His promises fail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14-16) Apparently nine sons of Beriah.
