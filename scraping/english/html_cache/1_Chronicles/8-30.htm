In ancient Israelite culture, the firstborn son often received a double portion of the inheritance and carried on the family name and responsibilities. The name Abdon means "servant" or "worshiper," which may reflect the family's devotion to God. This lineage is part of the genealogy of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, emphasizing the importance of maintaining tribal and familial records.<p><b>then Zur</b><br>Zur is a name that appears in various contexts in the Old Testament, often associated with nobility or leadership. The name means "rock" or "stone," symbolizing strength and stability. In the context of genealogies, it highlights the continuity and resilience of the family line. The mention of Zur in this genealogy underscores the importance of each family member in the broader narrative of Israel's history.<p><b>Kish</b><br>Kish is a significant name in the biblical narrative, as he is the father of King Saul, the first king of Israel. This connection to Saul provides historical context, linking the genealogy to the monarchy and the transition from tribal confederation to centralized leadership. Kish's inclusion in the genealogy emphasizes the divine orchestration of Israel's leadership and the fulfillment of God's plans through specific family lines.<p><b>Baal</b><br>The name Baal, meaning "lord" or "master," is often associated with Canaanite deities, which Israel was commanded to avoid. However, in this context, it is simply a personal name, reflecting the common practice of using names that might have broader cultural or religious connotations. This highlights the complexity of cultural interactions in ancient Israel and the need for discernment in understanding biblical names and their implications.<p><b>Nadab</b><br>Nadab, meaning "generous" or "noble," is a name that appears elsewhere in the Bible, notably as the son of Aaron, who served as a priest. While this Nadab is not the same individual, the repetition of the name suggests a cultural appreciation for certain virtues. The inclusion of Nadab in the genealogy serves as a reminder of the diverse roles and contributions of individuals within the family and the broader community of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abdon.htm">Abdon</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Jeiel, a descendant of Benjamin.

&#8220;The firstborn son&#8221; signals headship in the family line, reflecting God&#8217;s orderly design for inheritance and leadership (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Abdon&#8217;s placement confirms the literal genealogy of Benjamin&#8217;s clan, locating Gibeon&#8217;s household firmly in Israel&#8217;s history (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1, 29</a>).<p>&#8226; His name, meaning &#8220;servant,&#8221; quietly reminds us that even firstborn status is ultimately a call to serve under God&#8217;s greater purposes (<a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26&#8211;28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>then Zur</b><p>&#8226; Zur&#8217;s name appears again when the genealogy is repeated after the Babylonian exile (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-36.htm">1 Chronicles 9:36</a>), underlining the unbroken preservation of Benjamin&#8217;s records despite national upheaval.<p>&#8226; His inclusion shows God&#8217;s faithfulness to every individual in the covenant community, not just the more famous descendants (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Placing Zur after Abdon shows a deliberate sequence, stressing that every generation is linked and accountable to the one before it (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Kish</b><p>&#8226; Kish is highlighted elsewhere as &#8220;the father of Saul&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>), so the chronicler is quietly steering us toward the rise of Israel&#8217;s first king.<p>&#8226; By rooting Saul&#8217;s ancestry in a real, traceable family, Scripture underscores the historicity of his reign and of God&#8217;s dealings with Israel (<a href="/acts/13-21.htm">Acts 13:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of Kish here prepares readers to see how ordinary family lines can become vessels for national leadership when God chooses (<a href="/1_samuel/10-21.htm">1 Samuel 10:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Baal</b><p>&#8226; The name &#8220;Baal&#8221; reflects an earlier, legitimate Semitic term for &#8220;lord&#8221; before it was co-opted by Canaanite idol worship. Its appearance shows how language&#8212;and a family&#8217;s spiritual direction&#8212;can change over time (<a href="/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25-32</a>).<p>&#8226; Including Baal warns later generations not to confuse true worship of the LORD with cultural expressions that can drift into idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The chronicler&#8217;s honesty about the name demonstrates Scripture&#8217;s accuracy, recording facts without airbrushing potentially awkward details.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nadab</b><p>&#8226; Nadab completes the list of five brothers, echoing other five-fold listings that signify fullness (e.g., <a href="/genesis/43-34.htm">Genesis 43:34</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40</a>).<p>&#8226; His presence shows that every son, whether he becomes prominent in later narratives or not, is known to God and woven into His redemptive plan (<a href="/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; By chronicling Nadab with equal dignity, the text teaches that God values each member of the covenant family, not just those who achieve public recognition (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-22.htm">1 Corinthians 12:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/8-30.htm">1 Chronicles 8:30</a> records Gibeon&#8217;s five sons&#8212;Abdon, Zur, Kish, Baal, and Nadab&#8212;as an exact, literal genealogy within the tribe of Benjamin. Each name affirms God&#8217;s meticulous preservation of His people&#8217;s history, highlights the orderly flow of covenant blessings, and anticipates future leadership through Kish and Saul. The verse reminds believers that God sees every individual, safeguards every generation, and weaves ordinary family lines into His extraordinary purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">The sons of Abi-Gibeon</span>--that is, the Benjamite clans of Gibeon.

Both of the missing names, however (viz. <span class="accented">Ner</span> after <span class="cmt_word">Baal</span>, and <span class="accented">Mikloth</span> after <span class="cmt_word">Zacher</span>), are introduced in verses immediately succeeding, where their sons are spoken cf. One name, <span class="accented">Zacher</span>, also is spelt as Zechariah in <a href="/1_chronicles/9-37.htm">1 Chronicles 9:37</a>. Both these passages agree in representing Net as the grandfather of Saul. Not so the two passages in Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-51.htm">1 Samuel 14:51</a>), the first of which writes <span class="accented">Abiel</span> in the place of the grandfather instead of great-grandfather, which, however, need occasion little difficulty; and the second of which would certainly <span class="accented">allow</span> Ner to be grandfather to Saul, but seems to call him uncle. Even then, if we accept what the passage allows, it is somewhat remarkable that in the next verse Ner should be signalized as father of Abner rather than of Kish - a difficulty, however, much less considerable if we accept the suggestion (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) to translate ver. 51 thus, by the substitution of the word "sons" for "son:" "And Kish the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner, were <span class="accented">sons</span> of Abiel." It must be remembered at the same time that this is not equivalent to saying that they were necessarily brothers, but only descendants of the <span class="accented">chief</span> of the family, of the Demarch or Phylarch under mention in the genealogy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/8-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and Abdon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7687;&#183;d&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5658.htm">Strong's 5658: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abdon -- four Israelites, also a Levitical city</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was his firstborn</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;b&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
