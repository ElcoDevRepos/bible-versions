The age of thirty was significant as it marked the beginning of a Levite's full service in the temple, aligning with the age when priests began their duties (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>). This age requirement underscores the maturity and experience needed for the sacred responsibilities they were to undertake. The counting of the Levites reflects a structured approach to temple service, ensuring that those who served were adequately prepared and capable.<p><b>and the total number of men was 38,000</b><br>The specific number of 38,000 Levites indicates a substantial workforce dedicated to the service of the temple. This large number highlights the importance of the temple in the life of Israel and the extensive operations required to maintain it. Historically, this census would have been crucial for organizing the various duties among the Levites, such as musicians, gatekeepers, and those responsible for the maintenance of the temple. This organization is further detailed in the subsequent verses of <a href="/1_chronicles/23.htm">1 Chronicles 23</a>. The counting of the Levites also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to multiply the descendants of Levi, as seen in <a href="/genesis/46-11.htm">Genesis 46:11</a> and <a href="/exodus/1.htm">Exodus 1:1-5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service in the temple.

From the days of Moses onward, this tribe bore unique responsibilities: guarding the tabernacle, carrying the ark, and teaching the Law (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-8.htm">2 Chronicles 17:8-9</a>). In David&#8217;s time their focus shifted from transport duties&#8212;now obsolete because the ark rested in Jerusalem (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-18.htm">1 Chronicles 22:18-19</a>)&#8212;to temple worship, music, and administration (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28-32</a>).

The size&#8212;38,000&#8212;speaks of God&#8217;s abundant provision: worship would not lack hands, hearts, or voices. It also signals Israel&#8217;s growth from a nomadic clan to a kingdom with a full-time worship corps, foreshadowing the &#8220;royal priesthood&#8221; calling every believer (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3</a> shows God organizing His chosen servants.

There was now a practical and a legitimate object for doing it. This consideration helps to determine what it was that "displeased the Lord" in the former general census of David. In connection with this clause, <a href="/1_chronicles/27-23.htm">1 Chronicles 27:23</a> should be noted, where we read, "But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens." The period from the age of thirty years up to fifty (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3, 23, 35, 39</a>) was fixed under Moses, for those "that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation" (<a href="/numbers/4-47.htm">Numbers 4:47</a>). It is not certain, however, that this census did not inquire, in point of fact, respecting some below this limit of age. For we may note ver. 24 in the first place, and this is partly explained by <a href="/numbers/8-23.htm">Numbers 8:23-25</a>. The number "thirty and eight thousand" of our present verse may be compared with the "eight thousand and five hundred and four score" of <a href="/numbers/4-47.htm">Numbers 4:47, 48</a>. It is to be observed how promptly the national council did on this occasion commence with the arrangement of the ministers of religion, "the Levites." As we read (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>) of "thirty years" of age as the appointed age for the commencement of their ministry, and (<a href="/numbers/7-3.htm">Numbers 7:3</a>) of the present or "offering" of "six covered waggons and twelve oxen," which the twelve "princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, princes of the tribes," offered "before the Lord," which greatly lessened the laborious work of the Levites; so we find the commencing age reduced from time to time, to "twenty-five" years (<a href="/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>), and to "twenty years" of age, as in our present chapter (vers. 24-28). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Levites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hal&#183;w&#238;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
