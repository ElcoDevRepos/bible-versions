In the context of <a href="/1_chronicles/15.htm">1 Chronicles 15</a>, David is rectifying the previous mishandling of the Ark, which resulted in Uzzah's death (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-9.htm">1 Chronicles 13:9-10</a>). The Levites, chosen by God to carry the Ark (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>), are now fulfilling their role correctly. This divine help underscores God's approval and blessing on their obedience. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God empowering His chosen servants, as seen in <a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a> with Bezalel and Oholiab.<p><b>who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant was the most sacred object in Israel, symbolizing God's presence and covenant with His people (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10-22</a>). It contained the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and manna (<a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>). The Levites carrying the Ark signifies adherence to God's specific instructions (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). This act of carrying the Ark properly contrasts with the earlier incident where it was transported on a cart, leading to disaster (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-7.htm">1 Chronicles 13:7-10</a>). The Ark's journey to Jerusalem marks a significant moment in establishing the city as the religious center of Israel.<p><b>they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams</b><br>The number seven in Scripture often symbolizes completeness or perfection, as seen in the creation account (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). Sacrificing seven bulls and seven rams signifies a complete and perfect offering to God, reflecting gratitude and reverence. Sacrifices were a central part of Israelite worship, serving as atonement and expressions of devotion (Leviticus 1-7). This act of sacrifice upon the successful transport of the Ark indicates a renewal of covenantal relationship and worship. It also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who fulfills and perfects the sacrificial system (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure who provides divine assistance to the Levites, ensuring the successful transport of the Ark.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The tribe chosen by God to carry the Ark of the Covenant, representing their special role in Israel's worship and service.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, symbolizing God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifice_of_seven_bulls_and_seven_rams.htm">Sacrifice of Seven Bulls and Seven Rams</a></b><br>A significant act of worship and thanksgiving, reflecting the completeness and perfection associated with the number seven in biblical symbolism.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel who orchestrated the return of the Ark to Jerusalem, emphasizing the importance of proper worship and reverence for God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_assistance_in_obedience.htm">Divine Assistance in Obedience</a></b><br>God aids those who follow His commands.

After the tragedy with Uzzah (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-9.htm">1 Chronicles 13:9&#8211;10</a>), David learned that human enthusiasm is never enough; divine favor is essential. When David later said, &#8220;The LORD our God burst out against us because we did not ask Him about the proper order&#8221; (15:13), he acknowledged that God&#8217;s help comes when His ways are honored.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s aid is tangible. He &#8220;helped&#8221; in real time, just as He did for the priests who stepped into the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15&#8211;17</a>) and for Asa in battle (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse assures us that obedience invites assistance; it is not earned by merit but granted by grace. <a href="/psalms/54-4.htm">Psalm 54:4</a> says, &#8220;Surely God is my helper.&#8221; That promise is being illustrated here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Levites who were carrying</b><p>God&#8217;s help focuses on a specific group&#8212;the Levites entrusted with this sacred task. Earlier, David had allowed the ark to ride on a cart like the Philistines did (<a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7&#8211;8</a>), but <a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a> made it plain: the sons of Kohath were to shoulder it.<p>&#8226; The detail honors the God-given structure of worship. When the right people do the right job in the right way, blessing follows (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming the Levites, Scripture underlines personal responsibility. They could feel the weight of the ark&#8212;and the weight of privilege (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the ark of the covenant of the LORD</b><p>This is no ordinary box; it is the throne of the living God (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>).

Seven, the Bible&#8217;s number of completeness (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>), underscores the total devotion behind the offering.<p>&#8226; Bulls and rams signify both consecration (<a href="/leviticus/8-18.htm">Leviticus 8:18</a>) and atonement (<a href="/job/42-8.htm">Job 42:8</a>, where the same animals and number appear).<p>&#8226; The offering comes after obedience, not before it&#8212;an echo of <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, &#8220;To obey is better than sacrifice.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This public celebration mirrors later national gatherings: Solomon will offer a multitude of sacrifices when the temple is dedicated (<a href="/1_kings/8-5.htm">1 Kings 8:5</a>), and Hezekiah will use the same seven-and-seven pattern in revival (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-21.htm">2 Chronicles 29:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/15-26.htm">1 Chronicles 15:26</a> records a turning point: God graciously helped, the Levites faithfully carried, the ark advanced, and worship overflowed.

God had been adverse to those who conducted the Ark on the former occasion (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-9.htm" title="And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.">1Chronicles 13:9</a>), as was inferred from the sudden death of Uzza. Now, when the Levites had undertaken the work in due order, and no harm had befallen, it was understood that the Divine goodwill was with the enterprise. That they had borne the holy Ark six paces without any sign of wrath was enough to call forth the grateful offerings of hearts relieved from a dread which only ceased to haunt them when the event proved it to be groundless. Our text, more exact than Samuel, gives the number and kind of the victims then sacrificed. Others refer the two accounts to different sacrifices, taking Samuel to mean that at every six paces a bullock and a fat sheep were slain by priests stationed all along the course, while they suppose our text to refer to a final sacrifice, offered when the Ark had reached its destination. This solution of the difficulty appears incredible, especially as regards the supposition of priests not mentioned in the narrative. Another view understands our text in this sense, but makes the offering in Samuel an initial sacrifice of consecration. But it is not likely that the two sacrifices are really different: (1) because the narrative here is generally parallel with Samuel; and (2) the chronicler may have intentionally paraphrased the older text for the sake of explanation. (Comp. <a href="/numbers/23-1.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.">Numbers 23:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-29.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.">Numbers 23:29</a> for the sacrifice.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - This verse with the following four are paralleled by <a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12-16</a> The contents of this verse in particular reveal the intense anxiety and the trembling fear and awe with which the sacred burden was now again lifted.
