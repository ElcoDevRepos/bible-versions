The Kohathites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, who were set apart for specific duties related to the tabernacle and later the temple. The Kohathites were responsible for the most sacred parts of the tabernacle, including the Ark of the Covenant, the table of showbread, and the lampstand. This lineage emphasizes the importance of the Levitical priesthood and their role in maintaining the spiritual life of Israel.<p><b>Amminadab his son:</b><br>Amminadab is a less frequently mentioned figure in the Bible, but his inclusion here highlights the continuity of the Levitical line. The name Amminadab means "my people are noble," which may reflect the esteemed position of the Levites. This lineage underscores the hereditary nature of the priestly duties, passed down through generations.<p><b>Korah his son:</b><br>Korah is a significant figure in biblical history, known for leading a rebellion against Moses and Aaron as recorded in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>. This rebellion was a challenge to the divinely appointed leadership and resulted in severe consequences, including the earth swallowing up Korah and his followers. Despite this, the line of Korah continued, and his descendants became known for their role in temple worship, contributing several psalms (e.g., Psalms 42, 44-49, 84, 85, 87, 88). This demonstrates God's grace and redemption, as the descendants of a rebel were still used for His purposes.<p><b>Assir his son:</b><br>Assir, meaning "captive" or "prisoner," is a less prominent figure, but his mention indicates the continuation of the Kohathite line. The name may reflect the historical context of Israel's captivity and the challenges faced by the Levites in maintaining their duties during times of national distress. This lineage serves as a reminder of the enduring nature of God's covenant with the Levites, despite the ups and downs of Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kohath.htm">Kohath</a></b><br>One of the sons of Levi, Kohath is a significant figure as his descendants were responsible for the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects.

The descendants of Kohath through his eldest son, Amram, have been given from vers. 3-15. But the descendants now to he spoken of are through another son, here called Am-minadab, a name not appearing among the four of ver. 2, but apparently standing for the Izhar of that verse. For he is said to have a son Korah, by whom, indeed, the genealogy moves on, while in vers. 37, 38. and <a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1</a>, Korah is said to be the son of Izhar. Without the occurrence of this clue, we should have been at a loss to tell who Amminadab was, as we are now at a loss to explain the unexplained substitution of this new name.
