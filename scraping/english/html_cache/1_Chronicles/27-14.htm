This system ensured that the kingdom was always protected without overburdening any single group. The eleventh month corresponds to the Hebrew month of Shevat, which typically falls around January-February in the Gregorian calendar. This structure reflects the administrative wisdom and orderliness of David's reign, emphasizing preparedness and strategic planning.<p><b>was Benaiah the Pirathonite</b><br>Benaiah is a common name in the Old Testament, but this Benaiah is identified by his hometown, Pirathon, which is located in the territory of Ephraim. Pirathon is mentioned in <a href="/judges/12-15.htm">Judges 12:15</a> as the burial place of Abdon, one of the judges of Israel. This connection to a judge of Israel may suggest a region known for its leadership and valor. Benaiah's role as a leader of a division highlights his importance and capability as a military commander.<p><b>an Ephraimite</b><br>Ephraim was one of the tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son Ephraim. The tribe of Ephraim held significant influence and was often seen as a leader among the northern tribes. This tribal affiliation suggests Benaiah's prominence and the strategic importance of his division. Ephraim's central location in Israel made it a key area for defense and military operations.<p><b>There were 24,000 men in his division</b><br>Each division of David's army consisted of 24,000 men, indicating a well-organized and substantial military force. This number reflects the strength and readiness of Israel's army during David's reign. The consistent size of each division underscores the uniformity and discipline within the military structure.

Both civil and sacred spheres honored God&#8217;s pattern of worship and work.<p>- Twenty-four thousand well-trained soldiers in one month equal nearly 300,000 over a year, reminding us that God equips His people abundantly, &#8220;exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/27-14.htm">1 Chronicles 27:14</a> records the eleventh monthly military course led by Benaiah of Pirathon, an Ephraimite, commanding 24,000 soldiers.
