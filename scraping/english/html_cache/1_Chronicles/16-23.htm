The act of singing is a common form of worship in the Bible, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/96.htm">Psalm 96</a> and <a href="/psalms/98.htm">Psalm 98</a>, which echo similar themes. The invitation to "all the earth" reflects the inclusivity of God's kingdom, foreshadowing the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations. This universality is also seen in the prophetic vision of <a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>, where all ends of the earth are called to turn to God and be saved. The phrase underscores the belief that God's glory and majesty are to be recognized by all creation, aligning with the eschatological vision in <a href="/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a>, where every creature in heaven and on earth praises God.<p><b>Proclaim His salvation day after day.</b><br>The call to "proclaim His salvation" emphasizes the importance of continually sharing the message of God's deliverance. In the historical context, this refers to the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt and their ongoing relationship with God, as seen in the Exodus narrative. The phrase "day after day" suggests a perpetual and consistent declaration, highlighting the enduring nature of God's salvation. This is mirrored in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to share the gospel consistently, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where the disciples are called to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth." The concept of salvation here can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's saving work, as described in passages like <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> and <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>. The daily proclamation is a reminder of the ongoing need for evangelism and the transformative power of the gospel in the lives of individuals and communities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel who organized the return of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem and appointed Asaph and his brothers to minister before the Ark.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>A Levite appointed by David to lead worship and thanksgiving before the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the Ark of the Covenant was brought and where David established worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that represented God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>The call to "all the earth" implies a universal invitation to worship, extending beyond Israel to all peoples.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_call_to_worship.htm">Universal Call to Worship</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes that worship is not limited to Israel but is a call to all the earth.

This psalm, in the Psalter, consists of five strophes or stanzas of six lines each--an artistic arrangement which has been violated here.
