It is associated with a village or a region within Judah's territory. The mention of Etam here suggests a genealogical record, emphasizing the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite culture. Etam is also noted in other parts of the Bible, such as in the story of Samson (<a href="/judges/15-8.htm">Judges 15:8, 11</a>), indicating its significance in the tribal narratives.<p><b>Jezreel, Ishma, and Idbash:</b><br>These names are part of the genealogical record, highlighting the descendants of Judah. Jezreel is a name that appears in various contexts in the Bible, often associated with a fertile valley in Israel, though here it is a personal name. Ishma and Idbash are less prominent in biblical narratives, but their inclusion underscores the detailed recording of family lines, which was crucial for maintaining tribal identity and inheritance rights.<p><b>And their sister was named Hazzelelponi:</b><br>The mention of a sister, Hazzelelponi, is notable as genealogies typically focus on male descendants. Her inclusion may indicate her significance or the prominence of her family. The name Hazzelelponi is unique in the Bible, and its meaning is uncertain, though it may suggest a connection to divine favor or beauty.

Both variants look like evasions of a difficulty. The unusual expression "and these--Abi-Etam" may be a brief way of stating that the clans whose names are given were the dominant houses of Etam (or Abi-etam; compare Abiezer, <a href="/judges/7-11.htm" title="And you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall your hands be strengthened to go down to the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the host.">Judges 7:11</a>; <a href="/judges/8-2.htm" title="And he said to them, What have I done now in comparison of you?

Etam is known from the history of Samson (<a href="/judges/15-8.htm" title="And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelled in the top of the rock Etam.">Judges 15:8</a>, and <a href="/2_chronicles/11-6.htm" title="He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,">2Chronicles 11:6</a>); Jezreel--not Ahab's capital--from <a href="/joshua/15-56.htm" title="And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,">Joshua 15:56</a>, and as the city of Ahinoam, wife of David, from <a href="/1_chronicles/3-1.htm" title="Now these were the sons of David, which were born to him in Hebron; the firstborn Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; the second Daniel, of Abigail the Carmelitess:">1Chronicles 3:1</a>.

The other three names are unknown. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - Etam is, with little doubt, the name of a place (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-6.htm">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>) in Judah, south of Jerusalem. It was near Tekoah (ver. 5, and <a href="/1_chronicles/2-24.htm">1 Chronicles 2:24</a>) and Bethlehem (next verse). The hiatus in the first clause may possibly be supplied by "the families of" from the last verse, or, more fitly, by "the sons of," inasmuch as some manuscripts have it so. The Septuagint, however, and Vulgate <span class="accented">displace</span> "the father of" (<span class="accented">i.e. chief of</span>), replacing it by "the sons of." The Syriac Version leaves out any notice of the sister, Hazelelponi, and gives the former part of the verse thus: "These are Amina-dab's sons, Ahizareel, Nesma, and Dibas, Pheguel and Husia; These are the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratha, who was the father," etc. With this the Arabic Version is partly in agreement, but closes the verse with the words, "These are the sons of Hur, son of Ephratha, the father of whom [plural] was of Bethlehem." The Chronicle Targum translates, "the <span class="accented">rabbis dwelling at</span> Etam." This variety indicates the difficulty felt by each in turn. The verse, however, purports to give the names of three brothers and one sister (Hazelel-poni, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the shadow looking at me, Gesenius) connected with Etam, as in the following verse Penuel with Gedor (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-51.htm">1 Chronicles 2:51</a>) and Ezer with Hushah (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-29.htm">1 Chronicles 11:29</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/23-27.htm">2 Samuel 23:27</a>). Of no one of these, in all six other descendants of Hur, additional to those found at the close of ch. 2, is anything distinct known. It is to be noted that Hut himself is here called father of Bethlehem, while (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-51.htm">1 Chronicles 2:51</a>) his son Salma is so called. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/4-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1433;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
