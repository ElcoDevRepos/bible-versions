They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects, including the Ark of the Covenant, the table of showbread, the lampstand, and the altars. This role highlights their importance in the religious life of Israel. The phrase "the rest of the Kohathites" indicates that this allocation of cities was for those Kohathites who were not directly involved in the service of the tabernacle, as some of their brethren had already received their cities in other tribal territories.<p><b>ten cities were allotted</b><br>The allocation of cities to the Levites, including the Kohathites, was in accordance with God's command in <a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>. The Levites were not given a contiguous territory like the other tribes but were instead given cities scattered throughout Israel. This ensured their presence and influence across the nation, facilitating their role as spiritual leaders and teachers. The number ten signifies completeness and order, suggesting a sufficient provision for the Kohathites' needs.<p><b>from the half-tribe of Manasseh</b><br>The half-tribe of Manasseh refers to the division of the tribe of Manasseh, with one half settling east of the Jordan River and the other half west of it. The cities allotted to the Kohathites were from the western half, which was located in the central region of Canaan. This geographical location was significant as it placed the Kohathites in a strategic position to minister to the people of Israel. The division of Manasseh into two halves is a reminder of the complex tribal arrangements in Israel and the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>, where Ephraim and Manasseh were both given significant roles in the future of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kohathites.htm">Kohathites</a></b><br>A division of the Levites, descendants of Kohath, son of Levi.
