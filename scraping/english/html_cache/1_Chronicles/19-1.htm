It suggests a transition in the narrative, moving from David's conquests to the political dynamics involving neighboring nations. The timing is significant as it sets the stage for the unfolding events between Israel and the Ammonites.<p><b>Nahash king of the Ammonites died</b><br>Nahash was a notable figure in the history of Israel's interactions with the Ammonites. He is mentioned earlier in <a href="/1_samuel/11.htm">1 Samuel 11</a>, where he besieged Jabesh-gilead, leading to Saul's first military victory as king of Israel. Nahash's death marks a pivotal moment, as leadership transitions often led to shifts in political alliances and conflicts. The Ammonites were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>), and their territory was east of the Jordan River, in present-day Jordan. This region was often in conflict with Israel due to its strategic location and resources.<p><b>and was succeeded by his son</b><br>The succession of Nahash's son, Hanun, introduces a new chapter in the relationship between Israel and the Ammonites. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the transition of power could be a time of vulnerability or opportunity, as new leaders sought to establish their authority. This succession sets the stage for the events that follow, where David's attempt to show kindness to Hanun is misinterpreted, leading to conflict. The theme of succession and its challenges is echoed throughout the Bible, such as in the transitions from Saul to David and later from David to Solomon.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahash.htm">Nahash</a></b><br>The king of the Ammonites, a people often in conflict with Israel.
