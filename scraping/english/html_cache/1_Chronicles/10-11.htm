It is historically significant in Israel's narrative, particularly in the time of the Judges. The people of Jabesh-gilead had a special relationship with Saul, as he had previously rescued them from the Ammonites (1 Samuel 11). This act of deliverance created a bond of loyalty and gratitude towards Saul and his family. The city's location in Gilead, a region known for its balm and healing properties, symbolizes restoration and loyalty, which is reflected in their actions following Saul's death.<p><b>heard about everything the Philistines had done to Saul,</b><br>The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during the time of Saul and David. They were a seafaring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan. The Philistines' victory over Saul and his sons at Mount Gilboa was a significant event, marking the end of Saul's reign and the beginning of David's rise to power. The Philistines' actions included not only defeating Saul but also desecrating his body, which was a common practice in ancient warfare to humiliate the defeated and their people. This act of desecration was particularly grievous to the Israelites, as it was seen as an affront to their God and their king. The news of Saul's defeat and the subsequent treatment of his body would have been a source of deep sorrow and anger for the people of Jabesh-gilead, motivating them to act in honor of Saul's previous kindness to them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jabesh-gilead.htm">Jabesh-gilead</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Gilead, east of the Jordan River.
