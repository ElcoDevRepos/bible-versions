The Levites were set apart for religious duties, and their genealogies were meticulously recorded to ensure the proper fulfillment of their roles. Jahath being the first indicates his position of leadership or prominence within the family, which was a common practice in ancient Israelite culture where the firstborn often held a special status. This reflects the importance of order and hierarchy in the Levitical service.<p><b>but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons,</b><br>Jeush and Beriah, also sons of Shimei, are noted for having fewer descendants. In the context of ancient Israel, having many sons was often seen as a sign of blessing and strength, as it ensured the continuation of the family line and the ability to fulfill communal and religious duties. The mention of their limited offspring highlights the practical challenges faced by families in maintaining their roles within the Levitical order.<p><b>so they were counted as one family and received a single assignment.</b><br>Due to their smaller numbers, Jeush and Beriah's descendants were grouped together as one family unit for the purposes of temple service. This reflects the practical organization of the Levites, ensuring that all necessary roles were filled despite variations in family size. It underscores the adaptability of the Levitical system to accommodate different family circumstances while maintaining the integrity of their service. This principle of unity and shared responsibility can be seen throughout Scripture, emphasizing the collective nature of worship and service to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jahath.htm">Jahath</a></b><br>The first son mentioned in this verse, indicating a position of leadership or prominence within the family.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zizah.htm">Zizah</a></b><br>The second son, following Jahath in the family order.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeush_and_beriah.htm">Jeush and Beriah</a></b><br>These two brothers are noted for having fewer descendants, which affected their family&#8217;s role and responsibilities.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/family_assignment.htm">Family Assignment</a></b><br>The division of duties among the Levites, which was significant for the organization of temple service.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/importance_of_family_roles.htm">Importance of Family Roles</a></b><br>The verse highlights the significance of family roles and responsibilities within the community of faith.

In Levite culture, the firstborn typically carried greater responsibility for family worship duties (cf. <a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-12.htm">Numbers 3:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8211; Jahath, as Shimei&#8217;s eldest son (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-10.htm">1 Chronicles 23:10</a>), would have led his clan in temple service once David&#8217;s reorganization took effect (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24, 28</a>).<p>&#8211; The precise listing underscores God&#8217;s orderly design for worship: every task in His house has an appointed servant (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Zizah was the second</b><p>&#8211; Recording the second son safeguards the integrity of the genealogical line (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/6-1.htm">1 Chronicles 6:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8211; Though second-born, Zizah shared fully in the privileges of the Gershonite calling&#8212;care for curtains, ropes, and other sacred furnishings (<a href="/numbers/4-24.htm">Numbers 4:24&#8211;28</a>).<p>&#8211; The verse reminds us that in God&#8217;s service prominence is determined by calling, not merely by order of birth (see also <a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons</b><p>&#8211; Family size affected how temple work was distributed. A smaller household meant fewer hands for duty (<a href="/numbers/3-28.htm">Numbers 3:28</a>).<p>&#8211; By noting limited descendants, the chronicler explains why these two brothers could not sustain separate service groups like Jahath and Zizah (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-22.htm">1 Chronicles 24:22</a>).<p>&#8211; The detail also shows God&#8217;s compassion: He does not overburden His servants beyond their capacity (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so they were counted as one family and received a single assignment</b><p>&#8211; Practical wisdom merged Jeush and Beriah&#8217;s lines, allowing them to function efficiently as one unit (compare <a href="/1_chronicles/26-10.htm">1 Chronicles 26:10</a>, where a small family is likewise combined).<p>&#8211; &#8220;Assignment&#8221; points to the organized divisions David established for Levites&#8212;twenty-four courses rotating through temple service (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-6.htm">1 Chronicles 23:6</a>; 24:20&#8211;31).<p>&#8211; The consolidation illustrates two truths:<p>&#8226; God values unity over rigid formality when unity strengthens ministry (<a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Faithfulness, not numbers, secures a place in God&#8217;s plan; even a small clan mattered in maintaining worship at Jerusalem.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/23-11.htm">1 Chronicles 23:11</a> records how David, led by the Spirit, arranged Levite families for temple duties. Jahath and Zizah, as the eldest sons of Shimei, each headed their own service group. Jeush and Beriah, lacking sufficient male descendants, were wisely joined into one clan and given one shared task. The verse highlights God&#8217;s orderly provision for worship, His fairness in workload, and His inclusion of every faithful servant&#8212;large or small&#8212;in the ministry of His house.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">But Jeush and Beriah had not many sons.</span>--<span class= "ital">Now Jeush and Beriah had not multiplied sons; so they became</span> (one) <span class= "ital">father-home</span> (<span class= "ital">beth-ab</span>), <span class= "ital">one class</span> (or <span class= "ital">muster--p?qudd?h</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Altogether, then, there were nine Gershonite clans: viz., six of the sons of Laadan, and three of the sons of Shimei, among the 24,000 Levites of <a href="/1_chronicles/23-4.htm" title="Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:">1Chronicles 23:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In one reckoning</span>.
