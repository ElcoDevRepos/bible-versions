This location is significant as it marks the political and spiritual center of Israel. The City of David is the ancient core of Jerusalem, situated on a narrow ridge south of the present-day Old City. Archaeological excavations have uncovered structures that date back to the time of David, supporting the biblical narrative. David's construction efforts reflect his consolidation of power and the unification of the tribes of Israel under his rule. This act also signifies the beginning of Jerusalem's central role in Israel's history, both politically and religiously.<p><b>and he prepared a place for the ark of God</b><br>David's preparation for the ark signifies his deep reverence for the presence of God and his desire to restore the ark to a place of prominence among the people of Israel. The ark, which contained the tablets of the Law, represented God's covenant with Israel and His divine presence. David's actions demonstrate his commitment to honoring God and establishing a central place for worship. This preparation also foreshadows the eventual construction of the Temple by Solomon, David's son, where the ark would find a permanent home. The emphasis on preparing a place for the ark highlights the importance of proper worship and reverence for God.<p><b>and pitched a tent for it</b><br>The tent, or tabernacle, was a temporary dwelling for the ark until the construction of the Temple. This act of pitching a tent is reminiscent of the tabernacle used during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, where the ark was housed. It underscores the continuity of worship practices from the time of Moses to David. The tent symbolizes God's presence among His people, even in a temporary setting, and points to the future establishment of a more permanent dwelling place in the Temple. This temporary arrangement also reflects the humility and simplicity of worship that David sought to maintain, even as he prepared for a more grandiose future temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who sought to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, establishing it as the spiritual center of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_of_david.htm">City of David</a></b><br>Also known as Jerusalem, this is the city that David captured and made the political and spiritual capital of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_god.htm">Ark of God</a></b><br>The Ark of the Covenant, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel, which David desired to bring to Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent.htm">Tent</a></b><br>A temporary dwelling place for the Ark, signifying David's reverence and preparation for God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_god's_presence.htm">Preparation for God's Presence</a></b><br>David's actions remind us of the importance of preparing our hearts and lives to welcome God's presence.

Preparation now includes consulting the Law (15:13), sanctifying the Levites (15:14), and arranging proper transport (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By planning intentionally, David demonstrates that worship is not casual; reverence requires obedience (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and pitched a tent for it</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and pitched a tent for it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Until Solomon&#8217;s temple, the ark would reside in a tent, sometimes called the &#8220;tent of meeting&#8221; or &#8220;tabernacle of David&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-1.htm">1 Chronicles 16:1</a>; <a href="/acts/15-16.htm">Acts 15:16</a>).<p>&#8226; This tent recalls Israel&#8217;s wilderness worship (<a href="/exodus/33-7.htm">Exodus 33:7</a>), highlighting that God&#8217;s presence is not confined to stone walls but accompanies His people.<p>&#8226; The simplicity of a tent&#8212;contrasted with David&#8217;s palace&#8212;underscores humility before a holy God. It also foreshadows Christ, who &#8220;tabernacled&#8221; among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Though temporary, the tent becomes a thriving center of praise (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-4.htm">1 Chronicles 16:4-6</a>), proving that genuine worship depends on God&#8217;s presence, not architectural grandeur.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/15-1.htm">1 Chronicles 15:1</a> records three deliberate actions: David secures his own dwelling, deliberately prepares a site for the ark, and erects a tent to house it. The verse portrays a king whose personal stability fuels, rather than replaces, devotion. His careful, obedient arrangements teach that God&#8217;s presence deserves priority, planning, and humility&#8212;truths that still guide believers who seek to honor the Lord first in every arena of life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">And David made him houses.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">and he made</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> finished) <span class= "ital">a palace</span> (plural, intensive) <span class= "ital">for himself,</span> referring back to <a href="/1_chronicles/14-1.htm" title="Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.">1Chronicles 14:1</a>.

They also direct fresh attention to the sources upon which they drew. The history of the preparations made for the reception of the ark, and for its safe and religious escort into the city, is now proceeded with. These preparations occupied the three months, or part of the three months, spoken of in <a href="/1_chronicles/13-14.htm">1 Chronicles 13:14</a>. The <span class="cmt_word">houses</span> may have been both his own (<a href="/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a>) and the buildings referred to in <a href="/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>. The old tent, or <span class="accented">tabernacle</span>, is repeatedly alluded to, as in <a href="/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>. It will be remembered that the tabernacle established by Joshua at Shiloh remained there till the time of Eli, and the ark within it (<a href="/1_samuel/3-3.htm">1 Samuel 3:3</a>). Afterwards we find it removed to Nob, for there David ate the shewbread (<a href="/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6</a>). From thence, very possibly after the savage slaughter of the priests by the order of Saul, it was removed, and we find it at Gibeon, according to the above references. Here at Gibeon was an altar and "high place," which, in the earlier time of Solomon, formed the chief religious centre. The wanderings of the ark already given from Shiloh, through Philistia to Beth-she-mesh, Kirjath-jearim, Perez-uzzah, now land it in this tent in Jerusalem. It is no more sheltered in the tabernacle. But the tabernacle, as well as the ark, was ultimately brought to the new-built temple of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/8-4.htm">1 Kings 8:4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/9-19.htm">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/1-4.htm">2 Chronicles 1:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/15-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David constructed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
