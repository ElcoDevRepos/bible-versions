The seventh division corresponds to the seventh month, which in the Hebrew calendar is Tishrei. This month is significant for several Jewish festivals, including Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot, indicating a time of spiritual renewal and reflection. The organization of the army in this manner reflects the structured and orderly nature of David's reign, emphasizing preparedness and discipline.<p><b>was Helez the Pelonite,</b><br>Helez is identified as a Pelonite, which is a term that may refer to a clan or family group. The specific identification of Helez as a Pelonite suggests a distinct lineage or regional affiliation, though the exact location of Pelon is not definitively known. This highlights the diverse backgrounds of those who served in David's army, reflecting the unity of Israel under his leadership.<p><b>an Ephraimite.</b><br>Helez being an Ephraimite indicates his tribal affiliation with the tribe of Ephraim, one of the prominent tribes of Israel. Ephraim was a son of Joseph, and the tribe held significant influence in the northern part of the kingdom. This connection underscores the importance of tribal identity in ancient Israel and the role of Ephraimites in the nation's military and political affairs. The inclusion of an Ephraimite in David's army demonstrates the integration of various tribes into a unified national force.<p><b>There were 24,000 men in his division.</b><br>The mention of 24,000 men in Helez's division reflects the substantial size and strength of the military forces organized by David. This number signifies a well-prepared and formidable army, capable of defending the nation and maintaining peace. The structure of having 24,000 men per division for each month of the year illustrates the strategic planning and resource management during David's reign, ensuring that the kingdom was always protected without overburdening any single group of soldiers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/helez_the_pelonite.htm">Helez the Pelonite</a></b><br>Helez is identified as a leader of a division of twenty-four thousand men.
