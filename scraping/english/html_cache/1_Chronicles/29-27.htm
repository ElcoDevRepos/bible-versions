The number forty often symbolizes a period of testing or trial in the Bible, as seen in the forty years of Israel's wilderness wanderings and Jesus' forty days of fasting. David's forty-year reign can be seen as a time of establishing the kingdom and setting the stage for the future temple under Solomon.<p><b>seven years in Hebron&#8212;</b><br>Hebron, located in the southern part of Judah, was an ancient city with deep patriarchal roots, being the burial place of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. David's initial reign in Hebron was over the tribe of Judah alone, reflecting the division within Israel before he united the kingdom. This period was marked by political maneuvering and conflict, including the civil war with Saul's house.<p><b>and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</b><br>Jerusalem, captured by David from the Jebusites, became the political and spiritual center of Israel. The choice of Jerusalem as the capital was strategic, as it was centrally located and neutral among the tribes. David's reign in Jerusalem established the city as the "City of David" and laid the groundwork for its future significance, including the eventual construction of the temple by Solomon. The number thirty-three, while not as symbolically significant as forty, marks a long and stable period of rule, during which David expanded Israel's borders and centralized worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, King David was the second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and his role in uniting the tribes of Israel.
