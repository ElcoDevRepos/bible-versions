This act signifies a transfer of divine purpose and leadership. David's preparation of the plans underscores his dedication to God's house, even though he was not permitted to build it himself (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8</a>). This moment reflects the importance of legacy and obedience to God's will, as David ensures that Solomon has everything needed to fulfill this divine task.<p><b>for the portico of the temple</b><br>The portico, or porch, was an essential architectural feature of ancient Near Eastern temples, serving as a grand entrance. It symbolized the transition from the secular to the sacred. The temple's design, including the portico, was divinely inspired, reflecting heavenly realities (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a>). This element of the temple foreshadows Christ as the gateway to God (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>).<p><b>its buildings</b><br>The temple complex included various structures, each with specific functions. These buildings were designed to facilitate worship and the administration of temple duties. The detailed planning highlights the order and precision valued in worship, reflecting God's nature as a God of order (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p><b>storehouses</b><br>Storehouses were crucial for the temple's operation, holding supplies for offerings and the sustenance of the priests and Levites. This provision reflects the importance of stewardship and preparation in serving God. It also points to the spiritual truth that God provides for His people (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p><b>upper rooms</b><br>Upper rooms in ancient architecture often served as places of prayer and meditation. In the temple, they likely had specific liturgical functions. This aspect of the temple design can be seen as a precursor to the upper room where Jesus shared the Last Supper with His disciples (<a href="/luke/22-12.htm">Luke 22:12</a>), symbolizing communion and fellowship with God.<p><b>inner rooms</b><br>The inner rooms of the temple were reserved for sacred activities, emphasizing the holiness required to approach God. This design element underscores the separation between the holy and the common, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture (<a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a>). It points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who grants believers access to the Father (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-20</a>).<p><b>and the room for the mercy seat</b><br>The mercy seat, located in the Holy of Holies, was the place of atonement where the high priest would sprinkle the blood of the sacrifice once a year (<a href="/leviticus/16-14.htm">Leviticus 16:14-15</a>). It represents God's throne and His presence among His people. This foreshadows Christ's role as the ultimate High Priest and the propitiation for our sins (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>), providing eternal access to God's mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who, despite his desire to build a temple for the Lord, was instructed by God that his son Solomon would fulfill this task.

The "treasuries" or store-rooms of the Temple were probably in the side-building of three storeys (<a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm" title="And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:">1Kings 6:5</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-19.</span> - These hints respecting the parts of the building that was to be, and respecting the furniture of it, will come in for fuller consideration in the fuller treatment of them, found in the narration of the actual construction of the building in 2 Chronicles compared with <a href="/2_kings/6.htm">2 Kings 6</a>, etc. It is evident that David desired to make a solemn and set business of handing over even the patterns and plans. Nor is this under any circumstances wonderful, but least of all considering their Divine origin. The Divine original of the tabernacle and all its belongings (<a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-30</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>) was not to be a neglected precedent as regards the greater temple. It is said that "David gave" these "patterns to Solomon his son" (ver. 11), and the form in which he gave them is explained in ver. 19. There we read, "The whole in writing from the hand of Jehovah upon me, he made me to understand - all the works of this pattern." Whatever we generally accept respecting the <span class="accented">writing</span> of the tables of the Law by the finger of God (<a href="/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>; <a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-15.htm">Exodus 32:15, 16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-13.htm">Deuteronomy 4:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5, 22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10</a>), is at all events open for acceptance here. At the same time, the phraseology of our nineteenth verse is certainly not so uncompromising-as that of the references just instanced from the Books of Exodus and Deuteronomy. The words of ver. 19 may be satisfied by the meaning that David was in such manner and degree "in the Spirit" (<a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>), that in the writing and the drawing of patterns his hand was entirely under the guidance of that Spirit. In either alternative, to hand over such documents and such "patterns" must have been felt by David and all present an act of which much should be made. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The <span class="cmt_word">patterns</span> of six parts of the future building are here delivered over to Solomon. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The <span class="cmt_word">porch</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<a href="/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-6.htm">1 Kings 7:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-7.htm">Ezekiel 40:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>; <a href="/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>, where we read that the length was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred and twenty cubits; 2 Chronicles 8:12; 15:8; 29:7, 17); Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> rang generally, but in this verse <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is all that appears.
