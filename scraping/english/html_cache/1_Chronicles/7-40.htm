Asher's descendants were known for their prosperity and abundance, as prophesied by Jacob in <a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>, where he speaks of Asher's food being rich and providing royal delicacies. The tribe settled in the fertile region of Canaan, which contributed to their wealth and resources.<p><b>heads of their families,</b><br>In ancient Israel, family heads or patriarchs held significant authority and responsibility. They were responsible for the welfare and spiritual guidance of their families. This structure reflects the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite society, where family heads played a crucial role in maintaining tribal identity and continuity.<p><b>choice and mighty men of valor,</b><br>The phrase "mighty men of valor" is often used in the Old Testament to describe warriors of exceptional courage and strength. This designation highlights the military prowess and bravery of Asher's descendants. Such men were essential for the defense and expansion of Israelite territory, and their valor was a source of pride for their tribe.<p><b>and chiefs among the leaders.</b><br>The term "chiefs" indicates a position of leadership and authority within the tribe. These individuals were not only military leaders but also held administrative and judicial roles. Their leadership was crucial for maintaining order and justice within the tribe, and they were often involved in decision-making processes at both tribal and national levels.<p><b>The number of men fit for battle,</b><br>This phrase underscores the military readiness of the tribe of Asher. Being "fit for battle" implies that these men were trained and prepared for warfare, which was a constant reality in the ancient Near East due to frequent conflicts with neighboring nations and tribes.<p><b>recorded in their genealogies,</b><br>Genealogies were vital in ancient Israel for establishing identity, inheritance rights, and tribal affiliation. They served as official records that validated claims to land and leadership positions. The meticulous recording of genealogies reflects the importance placed on heritage and the continuity of God's promises to the descendants of Abraham.<p><b>was 26,000.</b><br>The specific number of 26,000 men fit for battle indicates a substantial military force within the tribe of Asher. This figure provides insight into the tribe's size and strength during the period of the chronicler.

By tying the descendants together with a single pronoun&#8212;&#8220;All these&#8221;&#8212;the writer reminds us that God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness reaches every name on the list. He had promised Jacob that each tribe would endure (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>), and here we see that promise fulfilled through Asher. Moses later blessed Asher with abundant provision and strength (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24-25</a>), and Joshua allotted them fertile coastal territory (<a href="/joshua/19-24.htm">Joshua 19:24-31</a>). Every generation carried forward that heritage, proving that the Lord keeps track of His people, whether famous or forgotten.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Heads of their families</b><p>Leadership in Israel started at home. &#8220;Heads of their families&#8221; signifies patriarchs trusted to guide clans in worship (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a>), justice (<a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-2</a>), and war (<a href="/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4</a>). Their role parallels elders in the church who shepherd households of faith (<a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4-5</a>). Scripture consistently presents family order as foundational for national strength; when fathers lead well, the people flourish (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Choice and mighty men of valor</b><p>The phrase points to quality before quantity. &#8220;Choice&#8221; warriors were tested, reliable, and battle-ready, much like David&#8217;s elite forces (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10-47</a>). &#8220;Mighty men of valor&#8221; echoes Gideon&#8217;s commissioning (<a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>) and Joab&#8217;s rallying cry (<a href="/2_samuel/10-12.htm">2 Samuel 10:12</a>). Courage is never merely natural boldness; it springs from confidence that &#8220;the battle belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). The tribe of Asher produced soldiers whose bravery was molded by faith, not sheer muscle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Chiefs among the leaders</b><p>These men were not just brave fighters; they also governed. Comparable terms appear when Moses appointed &#8220;capable men&#8221; over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens (<a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25-26</a>). From Asher came officers who could both swing a sword and settle a dispute&#8212;&#8220;men who understood the times&#8221; like the sons of Issachar (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>). God values leaders who combine strength with wisdom and humility (<a href="/proverbs/16-32.htm">Proverbs 16:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The number of men fit for battle</b><p>Military census figures matter because they reflect readiness to defend God&#8217;s inheritance.

By the Chronicler&#8217;s day the figure <a href="/bsb/isaiah/26.htm">Isaiah 26</a>,000. Fluctuations remind us that fruitfulness or decline hinges on obedience (<a href="/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3-8, 14</a>-17). Even so, 26,000 trained soldiers represent a substantial force, enough to stand with neighboring tribes when enemies arose (<a href="/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Recorded in their genealogies was 26,000</b><p>Genealogical records anchored identity after the exile, preserving legal rights to land and temple service (<a href="/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-64.htm">Nehemiah 7:64</a>). By noting the exact number &#8220;recorded,&#8221; the text underscores the historical reliability of Scripture; these figures were not estimates but documented facts. God&#8217;s people can trust that every detail&#8212;down to headcounts&#8212;is part of His inspired Word (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/7-40.htm">1 Chronicles 7:40</a> celebrates God&#8217;s faithfulness to Asher: a tribe with strong family heads, proven warriors, and capable leaders, all carefully counted and preserved in His record.

In the Mosaic census (<a href="/numbers/1-41.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Asher, were forty and one thousand and five hundred.">Numbers 1:41</a>) the total of males of the tribe of Asher was 41,500; and a generation later, the fighting men were 53,000 (<a href="/numbers/26-47.htm" title="These are the families of the sons of Asher according to those that were numbered of them; who were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.">Numbers 26:47</a>). The date of the present census is not assigned. If it be that of David, which appears likely, the tribe may have declined in numbers and importance by his day. (Comp. <a href="/judges/5-17.htm" title="Gilead stayed beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and stayed in his breaches.">Judges 5:17</a>. "Asher continued at the sea-shore, and abode on his creeks;" <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> did not bestir himself for the war).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Twenty and six thousand</span>. The number of Asherites, "of twenty years old and upwards, able to go forth to war," given in <a href="/numbers/1-40.htm">Numbers 1:40, 41</a>, was forty-one thousand five hundred. Forty years later (<a href="/numbers/26-44.htm">Numbers 26:44-47</a>; comp. ver. 2) the number was fifty-three thousand four hundred. But it is supposed that the twenty-six thousand of this verse may refer only to a portion of the tribe, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the large and distinguished family of Heber. It is to be noticed that the name of the tribe of Asher is not found in the list of the "chief rulers" lower down in this book (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-16.htm">1 Chronicles 27:16-22</a>). The tone also in which reference is made to <span class="cmt_word">Asher</span> and Manasseh and Zebulun coming to Jerusalem to Hezekiah's Passover (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-11.htm">2 Chronicles 30:11</a>) is very noticeable. This tribe, with Simeon, gave no judge to the nation, and of all the tribes west of the Jordan they stand by themselves in this respect. There is an ancient legend that the parents of St. Paul lived within the territories of Asher, at the place called Ahlab in <a href="/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>, otherwise Giscala, or Gush Chaleb. Against the uncertainty of the legend we may gratefully remember the certainty of the history of the "Anna,... daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser" (<a href="/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/7-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">these</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[were] the descendants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Asher&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1440;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_836.htm">Strong's 836: </a> </span><span class="str2">Asher -- 'happy one', a son of Jacob, also the tribe descended from him, also perhaps a city in Palestine</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heads</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#353;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7218.htm">Strong's 7218: </a> </span><span class="str2">The head</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of their families,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
