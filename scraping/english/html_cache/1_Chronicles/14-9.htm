They were a sea-faring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan. Their presence in the narrative often symbolizes opposition to God's chosen people. Historically, the Philistines were known for their military prowess and advanced weaponry, including the use of iron, which gave them a technological advantage over Israel. This phrase sets the stage for a confrontation between David, the anointed king of Israel, and the Philistines, who frequently sought to challenge Israel's sovereignty.<p><b>and raided</b><br>Raiding was a common military tactic in ancient times, used to destabilize and weaken opponents by plundering resources and causing chaos. The Philistines' raids were not just acts of aggression but strategic moves to assert dominance and control over key territories. This action reflects the ongoing conflict and tension between Israel and the Philistines, highlighting the need for strong leadership and divine intervention, which David often sought through prayer and consultation with God.<p><b>the Valley of Rephaim.</b><br>The Valley of Rephaim is a geographical location near Jerusalem, known for its fertile land and strategic importance. The name "Rephaim" is associated with ancient giants, suggesting a place of formidable reputation. This valley served as a battleground in several biblical accounts, emphasizing its significance in Israel's military history. The choice of this location by the Philistines indicates their intent to threaten Jerusalem and challenge David's rule. The valley's proximity to Jerusalem underscores the immediacy of the threat and the need for David to act decisively to protect his kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A recurring enemy of Israel, known for their conflicts with the Israelites throughout the Old Testament.
