The mention of Machir, the father of Gilead, connects this narrative to the tribe of Manasseh, as Machir was the firstborn of Manasseh (<a href="/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>). This inter-tribal marriage highlights the interconnectedness of the tribes of Israel. Gilead, a region east of the Jordan River, was known for its balm and rugged terrain, often symbolizing strength and healing. The union between Hezron and the daughter of Machir suggests a strategic alliance, possibly for territorial or familial consolidation.<p><b>He had married her when he was sixty years old,</b><br>The age of sixty for Hezron at the time of marriage is noteworthy, indicating a later stage in life for fathering children. This detail emphasizes the continuation of God's promises and blessings through the lineage of Judah, despite human limitations. It also reflects the cultural norms of the time, where marriages could occur at various stages of life, often influenced by social and familial obligations.<p><b>and she bore to him Segub.</b><br>Segub, the son born from this union, is part of the lineage that would eventually lead to the establishment of significant families within Israel. The birth of Segub signifies the ongoing fulfillment of God's covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, ensuring the growth and prosperity of the Israelite tribes. This lineage is crucial for understanding the genealogical records that lead to King David and, ultimately, to Jesus Christ, fulfilling the messianic prophecies of a ruler from the line of Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezron.htm">Hezron</a></b><br>A descendant of Judah, Hezron is an important figure in the genealogy of the tribe of Judah.

They lay in the trans-Jordanic district Trachonitis, the modern El-leyah and Jebel-Hauran. It is not possible to harmonize exactly the numbers of the cities given here with those in passages quoted above; nor is the translation of ver. 23, Authorized Version, very certainly the correct one. E. Bertheau, in his 'Die Bucher der Chronik erklart; 15. Kurzgef. exegetisches Handbuch. z. A.T.,' translates, "And Geshur and Aram took the Havvoth-Jair from them with Kenath and her daughter-towns, sixty cities." "Took" is supposed to mean here "retook," or "recovered." Though this suits the Hebrew syntax better, it does not suit so well our immediate context; nor have we any other information of such re, covering of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Later,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
