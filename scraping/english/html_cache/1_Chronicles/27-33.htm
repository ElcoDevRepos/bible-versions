His role as a counselor is significant, as he was considered one of the most trusted and influential figures in David's court. The position of counselor was crucial in the ancient Near Eastern monarchies, where kings often relied on a close circle of advisors for decision-making. Ahithophel's advice was so highly regarded that it was likened to consulting the word of God (<a href="/2_samuel/16-23.htm">2 Samuel 16:23</a>). However, his story takes a tragic turn when he defects to Absalom during the rebellion against David, which ultimately leads to his downfall and suicide (<a href="/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>). This highlights the themes of loyalty and betrayal, as well as the consequences of turning against God's anointed king. Ahithophel's life serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pride and the importance of faithfulness.<p><b>Hushai the Archite was the king&#8217;s friend.</b><br>Hushai the Archite is described as the king's friend, a title that indicates a position of personal trust and loyalty rather than an official court role. The term "friend" in this context suggests a close and intimate relationship with King David, one that goes beyond mere political alliance. Hushai's loyalty is demonstrated during Absalom's rebellion, where he acts as a double agent to thwart Ahithophel's counsel and protect David (<a href="/2_samuel/15-32.htm">2 Samuel 15:32-37</a>; 17:1-14). His actions are pivotal in ensuring David's survival and eventual restoration to the throne. The designation "Archite" refers to his origin from the region of Archi, near Bethel, indicating his geographical and tribal affiliations. Hushai's role as a faithful friend and ally to David can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate friend and advocate for believers, demonstrating loyalty and sacrificial love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahithophel.htm">Ahithophel</a></b><br>A highly esteemed counselor to King David, known for his wisdom.

His counsel was so highly regarded that Scripture says it &#8220;was like one inquiring of God&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/16-23.htm">2 Samuel 16:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet this same man later aligned with Absalom&#8217;s rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>). His defection shows how even brilliant insight can be twisted when a heart turns from loyalty to God&#8217;s anointed.<p>&#8226; David immediately prayed, &#8220;O LORD, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/15-31.htm">2 Samuel 15:31</a>). God answered by overruling Ahithophel&#8217;s plan through Hushai, proving <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>: &#8220;Many plans are in a man&#8217;s heart, but the purpose of the LORD will prevail.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse in Chronicles simply records his official position, reminding readers that gifted leadership is a blessing but never a substitute for obedience to the LORD (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hushai the Archite was the king&#8217;s friend</b><p>&#8220;Hushai the Archite was the king&#8217;s friend.&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-33.htm">1 Chronicles 27:33</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Friend&#8221; here is an official title, yet Hushai embodied genuine personal loyalty. When David fled Jerusalem, Hushai met him with torn clothes and dust on his head, sharing the king&#8217;s grief (<a href="/2_samuel/15-32.htm">2 Samuel 15:32&#8211;37</a>).<p>&#8226; David sent him back into the city to &#8220;frustrate the counsel of Ahithophel.&#8221; Hushai&#8217;s persuasive words turned Absalom from a swift attack to a fatal delay (<a href="/2_samuel/17-5.htm">2 Samuel 17:5&#8211;14</a>). God used friendship to defeat treachery, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>, &#8220;A friend loves at all times.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The role contrasts with Ahithophel: one man&#8217;s brilliance nearly toppled the kingdom, another man&#8217;s loyalty preserved it. The account prefigures the Friend who sticks closer than a brother (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>), pointing to the faithfulness of Christ toward His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/27-33.htm">1 Chronicles 27:33</a> places side by side two influential men in David&#8217;s court. Ahithophel exemplifies the power&#8212;and danger&#8212;of human wisdom divorced from steadfast allegiance, while Hushai highlights the protective strength of loyal friendship directed by God. Together they show that a leader needs counsel, but counsel must be anchored in fidelity to God&#8217;s purposes, for the LORD alone secures the outcome.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - For <span class="cmt_word">Hushai the Archite</span>, see <a href="/2_samuel/15-32.htm">2 Samuel 15:32, 37</a>;
