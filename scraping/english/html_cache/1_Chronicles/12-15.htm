The crossing of the Jordan River is significant in biblical history, reminiscent of the Israelites' entry into the Promised Land under Joshua's leadership (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>). This act symbolizes a transition into a new phase of God's plan, demonstrating faith and courage. The Jordan River often serves as a boundary between the wilderness and the land of promise, marking a point of commitment and trust in God's provision.<p><b>in the first month</b><br>The first month of the Hebrew calendar is Nisan, which corresponds to March-April in the Gregorian calendar. This timing is significant because it is the period of the spring rains, when the Jordan River would be at its fullest and most dangerous. The first month is also when the Passover is celebrated, a time of remembrance of God's deliverance from Egypt, adding a layer of spiritual significance to their crossing.<p><b>when it was overflowing all its banks</b><br>The overflowing of the Jordan River indicates a time of natural difficulty and danger. This detail highlights the bravery and determination of the warriors, as crossing a swollen river would have been a formidable challenge. It underscores their commitment to David and their trust in God's protection, echoing the miraculous crossing of the Jordan by the Israelites in Joshua's time, where God stopped the waters to allow safe passage (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15-16</a>).<p><b>and they put to flight all those in the valleys</b><br>This phrase describes the military prowess and success of David's warriors. The valleys mentioned are likely the low-lying areas surrounding the Jordan River, which were strategic locations for defense and agriculture. The ability to put enemies to flight demonstrates not only their skill in battle but also the favor of God upon them, as victory in biblical narratives is often attributed to divine intervention and support.<p><b>both to the east and to the west</b><br>This indicates the comprehensive nature of their victory, suggesting that their influence and control extended across both sides of the Jordan River. The east and west can symbolize completeness and totality, reflecting the widespread impact of their actions. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's people being a blessing to all nations, as their victories would have brought stability and peace to the region, aligning with God's promises to Abraham about his descendants' influence (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mighty_men_of_david.htm">The Mighty Men of David</a></b><br>These were the valiant warriors who supported David during his rise to kingship.
