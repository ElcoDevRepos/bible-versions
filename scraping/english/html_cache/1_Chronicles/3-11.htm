His reign is noted in <a href="/2_kings/8-16.htm">2 Kings 8:16-24</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/21.htm">2 Chronicles 21</a>. Joram's marriage to Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, brought the influence of Baal worship into Judah, which had significant spiritual consequences. This union highlights the dangers of alliances that compromise faithfulness to God. Joram's reign was marked by conflict and divine judgment, including a revolt by Edom and a letter of condemnation from the prophet Elijah. His life serves as a cautionary tale about the impact of ungodly influences and the importance of remaining true to God's covenant.<p><b>Ahaziah his son</b><br>Ahaziah, also known as Jehoahaz, was the son of Joram and Athaliah. His brief reign is recorded in <a href="/2_kings/8-25.htm">2 Kings 8:25-29</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/22.htm">2 Chronicles 22:1-9</a>. Ahaziah followed in the ways of the house of Ahab, continuing the idolatrous practices introduced by his mother. His reign was short-lived, lasting only one year, and he was killed by Jehu, who was executing God's judgment on the house of Ahab. Ahaziah's story underscores the theme of divine retribution and the fulfillment of prophecy, as Jehu's actions were in accordance with God's word through Elijah. His life illustrates the consequences of aligning with ungodly influences and the importance of heeding prophetic warnings.<p><b>Joash his son</b><br>Joash, also known as Jehoash, was the son of Ahaziah and became king of Judah after being hidden from Athaliah's murderous purge by his aunt Jehosheba. His story is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/11.htm">2 Kings 11-12</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/22-10.htm">2 Chronicles 22:10-24</a>:27. Joash was crowned king at a young age and initially guided by the priest Jehoiada, who helped restore the worship of Yahweh and repair the temple. Joash's early reign was marked by religious reform and a return to covenant faithfulness. However, after Jehoiada's death, Joash succumbed to the influence of corrupt officials, leading to idolatry and the eventual downfall of his reign. Joash's life highlights the importance of godly mentorship and the dangers of forsaking spiritual guidance. His reign also foreshadows the need for a perfect king, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who would lead with righteousness and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joram.htm">Joram (Jehoram)</a></b><br>Joram, also known as Jehoram, was a king of Judah, the son of Jehoshaphat.

This brief phrase affirms that the covenant line promised to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>) moves forward without interruption.<p>- In <a href="/2_kings/8-16.htm">2 Kings 8:16&#8211;24</a> and <a href="/bsb/2_chronicles/21.htm">2 Chronicles 21</a>, Joram&#8217;s reign reveals why the Chronicler records him but offers no praise:<p>&#8226; He married Athaliah, daughter of Ahab, drawing Judah into the idolatry of the northern kingdom.<p>&#8226; He killed his own brothers (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4</a>), showing how far a Davidic king could stray when he ignored God&#8217;s Law.<p>&#8226; Judgment followed&#8212;Edom rebelled (<a href="/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20&#8211;22</a>) and Joram died after &#8220;an incurable disease&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-18.htm">2 Chronicles 21:18&#8211;19</a>).<p>- Even with such failure, <a href="/2_chronicles/21-7.htm">2 Chronicles 21:7</a> notes, &#8220;Yet the LORD was not willing to destroy the house of David, because of the covenant He had made with David.&#8221; <a href="/1_chronicles/3-11.htm">1 Chronicles 3:11</a> silently underscores that truth: Joram&#8217;s unfaithfulness could not nullify God&#8217;s promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ahaziah his son</b><p>- The next link is Ahaziah, whose single-year rule (<a href="/2_kings/8-25.htm">2 Kings 8:25&#8211;26</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/22-1.htm">2 Chronicles 22:1&#8211;2</a>) shows the fragility of human leadership contrasted with God&#8217;s enduring plan.<p>- Scripture describes him as walking &#8220;in the ways of the house of Ahab&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/22-3.htm">2 Chronicles 22:3&#8211;4</a>). His alliance with wicked influences led to:<p>&#8226; A fatal visit to wounded King Joram of Israel, where Jehu struck him down (<a href="/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27&#8211;29</a>).<p>&#8226; A leadership vacuum that allowed Athaliah, his mother, to seize the throne (<a href="/2_chronicles/22-10.htm">2 Chronicles 22:10</a>).<p>- Yet even here, God preserved the covenant: &#8220;Jehoshabeath&#8230;hid Joash&#8230;so that he was not killed&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>). <a href="/1_chronicles/3-11.htm">1 Chronicles 3:11</a> quietly testifies that God&#8217;s purposes stand, no matter how short or sinful a king&#8217;s reign.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joash his son</b><p>- Joash (Jehoash) becomes the surprise survivor who keeps David&#8217;s line alive (<a href="/bsb/2_kings/11.htm">2 Kings 11&#8211;12</a>; <a href="/bsb/2_chronicles/23.htm">2 Chronicles 23&#8211;24</a>). The single phrase &#8220;Joash his son&#8221; in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-11.htm">1 Chronicles 3:11</a> captures a dramatic rescue story:<p>&#8226; As an infant he was hidden six years in the temple while Athaliah ruled (<a href="/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; At age seven the priests crowned him, restoring rightful kingship (<a href="/2_kings/11-12.htm">2 Kings 11:12</a>).<p>- Under Jehoiada the priest, Joash repaired the temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-4.htm">2 Chronicles 24:4&#8211;14</a>).

His assassination by servants (<a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20&#8211;21</a>) reminds us that lasting faith cannot be borrowed; each generation must cling to the LORD personally.<p>- Still, God&#8217;s faithfulness outshines Joash&#8217;s failure.
