He is most notably recognized as the father of Samuel, the prophet who anointed the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David. Elkanah's lineage is traced back to the tribe of Levi, which was set apart for religious duties and service in the temple. This connection emphasizes the hereditary nature of priestly duties in Israel. Elkanah's role as a Levite underscores the importance of maintaining religious traditions and responsibilities within the family line. His story is further elaborated in 1 Samuel, where his faithfulness and dedication to God are highlighted, particularly in his annual pilgrimages to Shiloh to worship and sacrifice.<p><b>Zophai his son</b><br>Zophai, also known as Zuph in some biblical references, is part of the genealogical record that traces the lineage of the Levites. The name Zophai means "honeycomb" or "watchman," which may imply a role of vigilance or sweetness in his character or duties. The mention of Zophai in the genealogical lists serves to establish the continuity and legitimacy of the Levitical line, which was crucial for maintaining the integrity of temple service. This lineage is important for understanding the hereditary nature of the priesthood and the fulfillment of God's covenant promises to the Levites. The genealogical records in Chronicles often serve to affirm the historical and spiritual heritage of Israel, linking past generations to the present.<p><b>Nahath his son</b><br>Nahath, also referred to as Toah or Toi in other genealogical accounts, is another link in the Levitical lineage. His inclusion in the genealogy underscores the importance of each generation in preserving the religious and cultural heritage of Israel. The name Nahath means "rest" or "quiet," which could symbolize a period of peace or stability within the family line. The genealogical records in Chronicles are not merely historical accounts but serve a theological purpose, emphasizing God's faithfulness in preserving His chosen people and their leaders. The continuity of the Levitical line through Nahath and others highlights the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel and the role of the Levites in upholding the spiritual life of the nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elkanah.htm">Elkanah</a></b><br>A descendant of Levi, Elkanah is part of the Levitical lineage, which is significant in the context of Israel's religious and priestly heritage.

This Elkanah is the same man introduced in <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a> and again in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33-34</a>, the father of the prophet Samuel. A few key observations:<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;his son&#8221; connects Elkanah directly to Jeroham (v. 25), underscoring an unbroken priestly heritage from Levi through Kohath (v. 1) to Samuel&#8217;s household.<p>&#8226; By repeating Elkanah&#8217;s name later in the chapter (v. 27), the writer stresses his importance as the link between the tribal history of Levi and the prophetic ministry that would shape Israel&#8217;s monarchy.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a> we see Elkanah faithfully traveling to Shiloh &#8220;year after year&#8221; to worship. The Chronicles genealogy rests that devotion on legitimate ancestry; Elkanah is no outsider but a genuine Kohathite who honors God in both lineage and practice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zophai his son</b><p>Immediately after Elkanah, the text states &#8220;Zophai his son.&#8221; Zophai is the same ancestor called &#8220;Zuph&#8221; in <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>. Scripture uses both spellings, but <a href="/1_chronicles/6-35.htm">1 Chronicles 6:35</a> pairs &#8220;Zuph&#8221; with Elkanah again, clarifying they are one and the same individual. Consider:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Land of Zuph&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/9-5.htm">1 Samuel 9:5</a>) points to a region named after this forefather, showing how family and geography intertwined in Israel.<p>&#8226; By preserving Zophai/Zuph in the record, the narrator affirms Samuel&#8217;s background in a specific Levitical clan, safeguarding the validity of Samuel&#8217;s later ministry recorded in <a href="/bsb/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3</a> and beyond.<p>&#8226; The repetition of Zophai in both historical (Samuel) and genealogical (Chronicles) books displays Scripture&#8217;s internal harmony&#8212;different authors, same lineage, same message of covenant continuity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nahath his son</b><p>Third in the sequence is &#8220;Nahath his son.&#8221; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-34.htm">1 Chronicles 6:34</a> lists him again (there spelled &#8220;Toah,&#8221; another acceptable rendering). Both forms identify the same person in the same generational slot. Important themes emerge:<p>&#8226; The chronicler is careful to trace every generation, affirming that no link is missing in the priestly chain from Levi to the music-leading sons of Korah (v. 31-38).<p>&#8226; Nahath&#8217;s placement demonstrates God&#8217;s faithfulness over time. From Levi in Egypt to Samuel in the hill country of Ephraim spans several centuries, yet each name manifests the LORD&#8217;s preservation of His covenant people (cf. <a href="/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18-20</a> for earlier Kohathite details).<p>&#8226; The attention to Nahath, a figure otherwise unknown, confirms that every servant in God&#8217;s plan&#8212;prominent or obscure&#8212;matters and is remembered (see <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a> for the divine &#8220;book of remembrance&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-26.htm">1 Chronicles 6:26</a> is more than a string of names. Elkanah reminds us that genuine worship arises from people rooted in God&#8217;s covenant. Zophai links family identity to the land, illustrating how God plants His servants where they will bear fruit. Nahath shows that even lesser-known generations are vital in preserving the priestly line. Together they testify that the LORD watches over every detail of history, ensuring that His purposes move steadily forward&#8212;from Levi, to Samuel, to the coming King whom Samuel would anoint, and ultimately to Christ Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) The Hebrew text reads: "Elkanah his son--Elkanah--Zophai his son," &c. Zophai might mean the Zophite. The LXX. has (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-25.htm" title="And the sons of Elkanah; Amasai, and Ahimoth.">1Chronicles 6:25</a>) "And sons of Elkanah, Amessi and Ahimoth;" (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-26.htm" title="As for Elkanah: the sons of Elkanah; Zophai his son, and Nahath his son,">1Chronicles 6:26</a>) "Elkanah his son, Souphi his son," &c. So the Syriac.

The second Elkanah in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-26.htm" title="As for Elkanah: the sons of Elkanah; Zophai his son, and Nahath his son,">1Chronicles 6:26</a> is therefore an intrusion, due perhaps to some scribe who remembered <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm" title="Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:">1Samuel 1:1</a>, where Zophim occurs just before Elkanah.

Perhaps Mahath is identical with the Ahimoth of <a href="/1_chronicles/6-25.htm" title="And the sons of Elkanah; Amasai, and Ahimoth.">1Chronicles 6:25</a>; if so, the true reading of <a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-25.htm" title="And the sons of Elkanah; Amasai, and Ahimoth.">1Chronicles 6:25-26</a> would be: "And sons of Elkanah: Amasai his son, Ahimoth (Mahath) his son, Elkanah his son, Zophai his son," &c. Zophai is to Zuph (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-35.htm" title="The son of Zuph, the son of Elkanah, the son of Mahath, the son of Amasai,">1Chronicles 6:35</a>) as Chelubai (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-9.htm" title="The sons also of Hezron, that were born to him; Jerahmeel, and Ram, and Chelubai.">1Chronicles 2:9</a>) to Chelub (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-11.htm" title="And Chelub the brother of Shuah begat Mehir, which was the father of Eshton.">1Chronicles 4:11</a>).
