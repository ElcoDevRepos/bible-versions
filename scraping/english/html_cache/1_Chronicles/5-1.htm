As the firstborn, Reuben held a position of prominence and was expected to inherit a double portion of his father's estate, as was customary in ancient Near Eastern cultures. The tribe of Reuben settled east of the Jordan River, in a region that is part of modern-day Jordan. This area was known for its pastoral lands, suitable for the large flocks and herds of the Reubenites.<p><b>Though he was the firstborn, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel,</b><br>Reuben lost his birthright due to his sin against his father, Jacob. The birthright, which included leadership and a double portion of inheritance, was transferred to Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. This transfer is significant in the biblical narrative, as it highlights the theme of God's sovereignty in choosing leaders and blessing those who are faithful. Joseph's elevation is a type of Christ, as he was rejected by his brothers but later became their savior.<p><b>because Reuben defiled his father&#8217;s bed.</b><br>Reuben's transgression is recorded in <a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>, where he slept with Bilhah, his father's concubine. This act was seen as a grave dishonor and a challenge to his father's authority. In the cultural context of the time, such an act was not only a personal sin but also a violation of family and social order. It demonstrated a lack of respect and self-control, disqualifying Reuben from the privileges of the firstborn.<p><b>So he is not reckoned according to birthright.</b><br>Reuben's exclusion from the birthright is a reminder of the consequences of sin and the importance of integrity and obedience to God's commands. The narrative underscores the biblical principle that God's blessings and leadership roles are not based solely on human traditions or birth order but on faithfulness and righteousness. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches that the last shall be first, and the first shall be last (<a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben.htm">Reuben</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Jacob (Israel) and Leah.

The tribe of Reuben is now taken third in order by the compiler, though Reuben was the first of all the sons of Israel. The distinct statements of vers. 1 and 2, respecting the degradation of Reuben and his loss of the rights of primogeniture, are not to be understood, however, as mentioned in any way to account for his standing third here. That Judah takes in any genealogy the first place needs no other apology than that contained in this passage, "Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> David, and in him "David's greater Son and Lord"). And that Simeon is taken immediately after Judah was natural enough, both because the second place belonged to him, and because his tribe, in journeying, in settlement, and in acknowledged friendship, was so nearly related to that of Judah. It is as an important historical fact, a lesson and stern memento of crime, that the tale of Reuben is here as elsewhere told. Indeed, in the remarkably exalting language applied to Reuben (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>) by the dying father in those "blessings" of his sons which were so marvellously living with prophecy, that "blessing" seemed weighted with hard reality, and may really carry this meaning: "O Reuben I <span class="accented">though</span> thou <span class="accented">art</span> my firstborn, <span class="accented">though</span> my might and the beginning of my strength, <span class="accented">though</span> the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power," <span class="accented">yet</span>, because of thy boiling lust (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>) "thou shall not excel." In that endowing charter of the patriarch's death-bed, the birthright of Reuben is not in so many words given to Joseph and his sons, but what is given to Joseph is so abundant above the lot of all the others, that we find no difficulty in accepting the formal statement of the fact here first found in this passage. The large measure of promise meted to Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-12</a>) rests, no doubt, upon the title already referred to. There would seem to be also a righteous moral reason in Joseph after all becoming heir to the birthright, inasmuch as he was the eldest child of her who was Israel's real love, and who, but for deception and sharp practice, would have been his first wife. How he remembered her, and with what determined practical consequence, the affecting passage, <a href="/genesis/48-1.htm">Genesis 48:1-7, 16, 21, 22</a>, sufficiently reveals; yet comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>. The meaning of the last clause of ver. 1 is evidently that, though thus Reuben was the natural firstborn, and Joseph had really the birthright, the registration did not proceed in this instance (probably partly for the very reason of the ambiguity) by the order of birthright, but everything yielded to the special call for precedence on the part of Judah (ver. 2). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These were the sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
