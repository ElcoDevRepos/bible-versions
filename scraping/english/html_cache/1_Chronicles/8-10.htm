The tribe of Benjamin held a unique position among the tribes of Israel, being the smallest tribe but producing significant figures such as King Saul and the Apostle Paul. The mention of these names highlights the importance of family lineage and heritage in Israelite society. The names themselves, while not widely known elsewhere in Scripture, contribute to the detailed genealogical records that were crucial for maintaining tribal identity and inheritance rights.<p><b>These were his sons,</b><br>This phrase indicates the direct lineage from a father, emphasizing the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society. Lineage was crucial for determining inheritance, tribal affiliation, and fulfilling God's promises to the patriarchs. The genealogies in Chronicles serve to connect the post-exilic community to their ancestral roots, reinforcing their identity as God's chosen people. This connection to ancestry was vital for the Israelites, especially after the Babylonian exile, as they sought to reestablish their cultural and religious identity.<p><b>heads of families.</b><br>Being a "head of a family" or "chief" signifies a position of leadership and responsibility within the clan or tribe. In ancient Israel, family heads were responsible for the welfare, spiritual guidance, and legal matters of their family members. This role was crucial for maintaining order and continuity within the tribe. The mention of these individuals as heads of families underscores the importance of leadership and governance in maintaining the social and religious fabric of Israelite society. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God working through families and leaders to accomplish His purposes, as seen throughout the narratives of the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeuz.htm">Jeuz</a></b><br>One of the sons of Benjamin, mentioned as a head of a family.
