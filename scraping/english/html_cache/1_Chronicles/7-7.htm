The listing of his sons&#8212;Ezbon, Uzzi, Uzziel, Jerimoth, and Iri&#8212;reflects the importance of family lineage in Israelite society. Each name represents a family head, indicating their role in maintaining the tribal structure. The names themselves may carry meanings that reflect the character or destiny of the individuals, a common practice in biblical times. For example, "Uzzi" means "my strength," which could imply a strong or influential family line.<p><b>heads of their families&#8212;five in all</b><br>The phrase "heads of their families" underscores the patriarchal nature of ancient Israelite society, where family leadership was typically passed down through male descendants. The number five may symbolize completeness or strength, as numbers often hold symbolic significance in biblical texts. These family heads would have been responsible for the welfare and leadership of their respective clans, playing crucial roles in tribal governance and military organization.<p><b>There were 22,034 mighty men of valor</b><br>The mention of "22,034 mighty men of valor" highlights the military capability and strength of the tribe of Benjamin. "Mighty men of valor" is a term used throughout the Old Testament to describe warriors of exceptional bravery and skill. This large number indicates the significant contribution of Bela's descendants to the military forces of Israel, reflecting the tribe's importance in national defense and warfare. The emphasis on valor also points to the cultural value placed on courage and heroism.<p><b>listed in their genealogies</b><br>Genealogies were vital in ancient Israel for establishing identity, inheritance rights, and tribal affiliation. Being "listed in their genealogies" ensured that these men were recognized as legitimate members of the tribe of Benjamin, with all the rights and responsibilities that entailed. This record-keeping was crucial for maintaining the integrity of the tribal system and for fulfilling God's promises to the patriarchs regarding their descendants. Genealogies also serve a theological purpose, demonstrating God's faithfulness in preserving His people throughout generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bela.htm">Bela</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

By beginning with &#8220;The sons of Bela,&#8221; Scripture reminds us that covenant faithfulness is traced through real families, not abstract ideas. Just as &#8220;the LORD remembers His covenant forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8</a>), He remembers the offspring of Bela.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ezbon, Uzzi, Uzziel, Jerimoth, and Iri</b><p>Five sons are named&#8212;Ezbon, Uzzi, Uzziel, Jerimoth, Iri&#8212;showing the breadth of Bela&#8217;s line. <a href="/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38-39</a> lists comparable names, underscoring that Chronicles harmonizes with earlier revelation. God&#8217;s Word consistently records the same family branches, assuring us that every detail is trustworthy (<a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>). These five men also mirror the five-fold blessing Jacob spoke over Benjamin&#8217;s tribe (<a href="/genesis/49-27.htm">Genesis 49:27</a>), reflecting God&#8217;s generous multiplication.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Heads of their families&#8212;five in all</b><p>Being &#8220;heads of their families&#8221; indicates recognized leadership (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-12.htm">1 Chronicles 15:12</a>). The verse counts &#8220;five in all,&#8221; emphasizing completeness and order. God values structure within His people; strong, godly leadership in each household becomes the backbone of the entire nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There were 22,034 mighty men of valor</b><p>The Chronicler tallies 22,034 fighting men, celebrating Benjamin&#8217;s strength.

Such a large number for one clan shows God&#8217;s blessing of fruitfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-10.htm">Deuteronomy 1:10-11</a>) and His provision of defense for His people (<a href="/psalms/144-1.htm">Psalm 144:1</a>).

By preserving these lists, God demonstrates that He &#8220;knows those who are His&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>).
