However, in this context, Shaul is a descendant of Simeon, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The tribe of Simeon was initially allocated land within the territory of Judah, as seen in <a href="/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>. This integration into Judah's territory may have influenced the tribe's identity and historical records. The mention of Shaul's sons indicates the continuation of his lineage, which is significant in the chronicling of Israel's tribes.<p><b>Shallum:</b><br>Shallum is a name that appears several times in the Old Testament, often associated with different individuals. In this context, Shallum is one of the sons of Shaul, contributing to the genealogical record of the tribe of Simeon. The name Shallum means "retribution" or "recompense," which may reflect cultural or familial expectations. Genealogies like this one serve to establish tribal identities and connections, which were crucial for inheritance rights and social structure in ancient Israel.<p><b>Mibsam:</b><br>Mibsam is another son of Shaul, and his name means "sweet-smelling" or "fragrant." This name might reflect cultural values or familial hopes for the individual. The inclusion of Mibsam in the genealogy underscores the importance of recording family lines, which was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures. These records helped preserve tribal heritage and ensured the continuity of family traditions and responsibilities.<p><b>and Mishma:</b><br>Mishma, the third son of Shaul mentioned here, has a name that means "hearing" or "obedience." This name could signify the family's desire for obedience to God or adherence to cultural norms. The genealogical record of Mishma and his brothers highlights the chronicler's intent to preserve the history and identity of the Simeonite tribe. Such records were vital for maintaining the integrity of Israel's tribal system and ensuring that each tribe's role and contributions were remembered throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shallum.htm">Shallum</a></b><br>A descendant of Simeon, Shallum is part of the genealogical record that traces the lineage of the tribe of Simeon.
