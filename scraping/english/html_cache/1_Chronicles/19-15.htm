Their alliance with the Arameans, a powerful group from the region of modern-day Syria, was strategic. The Arameans' retreat signaled a turning point in the battle, causing fear and demoralization among the Ammonites. This reflects the common ancient Near Eastern practice of forming coalitions for military strength, and the psychological impact of seeing allies retreat.<p><b>they too fled before Joab&#8217;s brother Abishai</b><br>Abishai, the son of Zeruiah and brother of Joab, was a prominent military leader under King David. His reputation and leadership were significant enough to cause the Ammonites to flee. This highlights the importance of strong leadership and the influence of key figures in biblical narratives. The flight of the Ammonites also demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel victory over its enemies when they are faithful.<p><b>and they entered the city</b><br>The Ammonites retreated to their fortified city, likely Rabbah, their capital. Fortified cities were common in the ancient world, providing refuge and a defensive advantage. This action underscores the strategic importance of cities in warfare and the reliance on fortifications for protection.<p><b>So Joab went back to Jerusalem</b><br>Joab, the commander of David's army, returned to Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel. This return signifies the completion of the immediate military campaign and a temporary cessation of hostilities. Jerusalem, as the city of David, represents the heart of Israelite governance and worship, emphasizing the centrality of the city in Israel's national identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A group of people descended from Lot, often in conflict with Israel.
