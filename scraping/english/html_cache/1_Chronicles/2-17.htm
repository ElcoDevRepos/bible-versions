Her role as the mother of Amasa places her in the genealogical line that connects to the leadership of Israel. Amasa was appointed by Absalom as the commander of his army during the rebellion against David, which highlights the complex family dynamics and political tensions within David's reign. This connection underscores the importance of familial ties and loyalties in the biblical narrative, as well as the recurring theme of internal conflict within the house of David.<p><b>whose father was Jether the Ishmaelite</b><br>Jether, also known as Ithra in some translations, is identified as an Ishmaelite, indicating his descent from Ishmael, the son of Abraham and Hagar. This detail is significant as it highlights the intermingling of different ethnic and tribal groups within Israel's history. The Ishmaelites were traditionally seen as outsiders to the covenant community of Israel, yet Jether's inclusion in the genealogy of Judah reflects the broader biblical theme of God's purposes extending beyond ethnic boundaries. This connection also serves as a reminder of the complex relationships between the descendants of Abraham, including both the Israelites and the Ishmaelites, and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through diverse lineages.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abigail.htm">Abigail</a></b><br>A woman mentioned in the genealogy of Judah.

Both labels can be accurate, just viewed from different angles, similar to Joseph being called both a carpenter&#8217;s son and &#8220;son of David&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a>; 1:20).<p>&#8226; The Ishmaelite note shows Gentile blood mingling in David&#8217;s extended family, foreshadowing the broader inclusion of nations in God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; This detail also hints at God&#8217;s sovereign freedom: He can raise leaders from unexpected backgrounds, blending covenant and non-covenant lines to display grace (<a href="/romans/9-15.htm">Romans 9:15-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a> records that Abigail, David&#8217;s sister, bore Amasa to Jether the Ishmaelite.
