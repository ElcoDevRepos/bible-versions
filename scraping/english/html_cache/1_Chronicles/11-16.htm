The stronghold likely refers to the cave of Adullam or the fortress of Zion, both significant in David's military strategy. This setting highlights David's reliance on God for protection and guidance, as he often sought refuge in fortified places during times of danger. The stronghold symbolizes God's provision and security, a theme echoed in Psalms where God is frequently referred to as a fortress or refuge (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p><b>and the garrison of the Philistines was at Bethlehem</b><br>Bethlehem, David's hometown, was under Philistine control, indicating the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Philistines. This occupation underscores the Philistines' threat to Israel and the strategic importance of Bethlehem. The Philistines' presence in Bethlehem is a reminder of the spiritual and physical battles God's people face. This situation foreshadows the ultimate victory of David, a type of Christ, who would reclaim and establish his kingdom.
