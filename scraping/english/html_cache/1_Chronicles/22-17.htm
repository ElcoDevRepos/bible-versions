His leadership has been marked by military conquests and the establishment of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel. This command reflects his role as a decisive leader who is preparing for a smooth transition of power. David's actions here are consistent with his character as a man after God's own heart, seeking to ensure that God's plans for Israel continue beyond his lifetime.<p><b>all the leaders of Israel</b><br>The leaders of Israel include tribal chiefs, military commanders, and other influential figures within the nation. This collective leadership structure was crucial for maintaining unity among the twelve tribes. By involving them, David is ensuring that Solomon has the necessary support to succeed. This reflects the importance of communal leadership and shared responsibility in the governance of Israel, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>to help his son Solomon</b><br>Solomon, David's son with Bathsheba, is chosen to succeed David as king. This choice is significant because Solomon is not David's eldest son, which was the traditional line of succession. David's directive to the leaders to support Solomon underscores the divine selection of Solomon, as God had promised David that his son would build the temple (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). This also prefigures the peace and wisdom that Solomon's reign would bring, as his name means "peace." Solomon is a type of Christ in his role as a king of peace and wisdom, foreshadowing the ultimate reign of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is nearing the end of his reign.
