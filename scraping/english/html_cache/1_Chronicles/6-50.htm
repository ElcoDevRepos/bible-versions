His descendants were given the responsibility of the priesthood, serving in the tabernacle and later in the temple. This lineage is significant as it establishes the hereditary priesthood, which was central to Israelite worship and religious life. The priesthood was a type of Christ, who is our High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, as described in <a href="/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>.<p><b>Eleazar his son,</b><br>Eleazar succeeded Aaron as high priest after Aaron's death. He played a crucial role during the Israelites' journey in the wilderness and the conquest of Canaan. Eleazar's leadership is noted in the distribution of the land among the tribes of Israel (<a href="/joshua/14.htm">Joshua 14:1</a>). His name means "God has helped," reflecting the divine assistance given to the priestly line. Eleazar's role as high priest prefigures Christ's intercessory work for believers.<p><b>Phinehas his son,</b><br>Phinehas is known for his zealous action in <a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>, where he stopped a plague among the Israelites by executing an Israelite man and a Midianite woman who were defying God's commands. This act of zeal earned him a covenant of peace and a perpetual priesthood (<a href="/numbers/25-10.htm">Numbers 25:10-13</a>). Phinehas' actions highlight the importance of holiness and obedience to God, themes that are echoed in the New Testament call to live a life set apart for God.<p><b>Abishua his son,</b><br>Abishua is a less prominent figure in the biblical narrative, but his inclusion in the genealogy underscores the continuity of the priestly line. His name means "my father is salvation," which can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate salvation brought through Jesus Christ. The genealogical record serves to authenticate the legitimacy of the priesthood and its divine appointment, pointing forward to the eternal priesthood of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, brother of Moses, and a key figure in the Exodus account.
