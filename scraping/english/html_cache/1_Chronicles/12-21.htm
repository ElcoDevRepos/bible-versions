The "raiders" likely refer to groups such as the Amalekites or Philistines, who frequently attacked Israelite territories. David's ability to gather support against these raiders demonstrates his leadership and God's favor upon him. This assistance is reminiscent of the divine help promised to those who are chosen by God, as seen in other biblical narratives like Gideon's victory over the Midianites (Judges 7).<p><b>for they were all mighty men of valor</b><br>The term "mighty men of valor" indicates not only physical strength but also courage and loyalty. These men were renowned warriors, similar to the "Gibborim" mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/23.htm">2 Samuel 23</a>, who were known for their extraordinary feats in battle. Their valor is a testament to the kind of followers David attracted, reflecting his own qualities as a leader and foreshadowing the type of kingdom he would establish.<p><b>and commanders in the army</b><br>This phrase underscores the leadership and experience of those who joined David. They were not just ordinary soldiers but commanders, indicating a level of respect and authority. Their willingness to follow David suggests a recognition of his God-given right to lead Israel. This mirrors the way Jesus gathered His disciples, who were also leaders in their own right, to establish His spiritual kingdom. The presence of these commanders also fulfills the prophecy of a united Israel under a divinely appointed king, as seen in the promises made to Abraham and later to David himself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who was in the process of consolidating his rule over the nation.
