Gedor is believed to be a location in the southern part of Judah, possibly near the hill country. The journey signifies a movement towards expansion and settlement, a common theme in the Old Testament as tribes sought to establish themselves in the Promised Land. This reflects the broader narrative of Israel's history, where the tribes often moved to claim and settle in areas that were part of God's covenant promise to Abraham.<p><b>to the east side of the valley</b><br>The mention of the "east side of the valley" provides a geographical marker that helps identify the specific area the Simeonites were exploring. Valleys in biblical times were often fertile and suitable for agriculture and grazing, making them desirable locations for settlement. This detail underscores the practical considerations of the tribe as they sought land that could sustain their growing numbers and livestock. The east side may also imply a strategic choice, as eastern regions were often associated with sunrise and new beginnings, symbolizing hope and prosperity.<p><b>in search of pasture for their flocks</b><br>The search for pasture highlights the pastoral lifestyle of the Simeonites, who, like many other tribes of Israel, relied heavily on livestock for their livelihood. This search is reminiscent of the nomadic traditions of the patriarchs, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who also moved in search of fertile land for their herds. The need for pasture reflects the dependence on God's provision and the fulfillment of His promises to provide for His people. This quest for sustenance can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual nourishment, drawing parallels to Jesus as the Good Shepherd who provides for His flock.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_simeonites.htm">The Simeonites</a></b><br>This verse refers to the descendants of Simeon, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

There is a town of the name situated in the mountainous district of Judah between Halhul and Beth-zur, to the north of Hebron (<a href="/joshua/15-58.htm">Joshua 15:58</a>). It is evident that this cannot be the place we require here. There is another town of the name (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-7.htm">1 Chronicles 12:7</a>), probably belonging to Benjamin, and which as little admits of being fitted in here. Both the Alexandrine and the Vatican Codex of the Septuagint, however, evidently read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span>. Now, Gerar of the Philistines would suit well for position and description, and also (<a href="/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>) for the allusion found here (ver. 40) to the dwelling there "of old" of the people of Ham. The Hebrew word, however, generally applied to the valley of Gerar (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, wady) is not the word used here of Gedor (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;</span>, ravine). See Stanley's 'Syria and Palestine,' p. 159, and note. Not only are references frequent to the fertility of Gerar, but the significance of that in <a href="/2_chronicles/14-14.htm">2 Chronicles 14:14</a> speaks for itself. This alteration of reading, however, with acceptance of the Septuagint manuscripts, cannot be regarded as altogether satisfactory, and Keil ('Comm.,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) offers some suggestions of weight against those of Ewald, Bertheau, and others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/4-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and they journeyed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
