The name Adina means "delicate" or "slender," which contrasts with his role as a warrior. Shiza, his father, is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, suggesting that Adina's prominence is due to his own achievements. The Reubenites were descendants of Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, who lost his birthright due to his transgression (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3-4</a>). This background highlights the redemption and valor found in Adina's leadership, despite the tribe's earlier failings.<p><b>chief of the Reubenites</b><br>Adina's position as chief signifies his leadership and authority within the tribe of Reuben. This role would have required significant military and administrative skills, as well as the respect of his peers. The Reubenites, settled east of the Jordan River, were often involved in conflicts due to their geographical location. Adina's leadership would have been crucial in maintaining the tribe's security and influence. His role as chief also reflects the tribal structure of ancient Israel, where each tribe had its own leaders and warriors.<p><b>and the thirty with him</b><br>The "thirty" refers to a group of elite warriors who served King David. This group, sometimes called "David's Mighty Men," was renowned for their bravery and skill in battle. The number thirty is symbolic, representing a complete and formidable unit, though the actual number may have varied. These warriors were crucial in establishing and defending David's kingdom, and their loyalty and prowess were legendary. The mention of "the thirty" alongside Adina underscores his inclusion in this distinguished group, highlighting his valor and the trust placed in him by David. This connection to David's mighty men also foreshadows the unity and strength found in the body of Christ, where each member plays a vital role in the spiritual battles faced by the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adina.htm">Adina</a></b><br>A leader among the Reubenites, noted for his bravery and leadership.
