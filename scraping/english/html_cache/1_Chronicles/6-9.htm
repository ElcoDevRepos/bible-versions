In the context of <a href="/1_chronicles/6.htm">1 Chronicles 6</a>, Ahimaaz is part of the genealogy of the Levitical priesthood, tracing the lineage from Levi through Aaron. This lineage is crucial for establishing the legitimacy and continuity of the priestly office in Israel. Ahimaaz's name means "brother of anger" or "my brother is wrath," which may reflect the cultural significance of names in ancient Israel, often conveying character or destiny. The genealogical record here underscores the importance of maintaining a pure priestly line, as the priests were responsible for mediating between God and the people, performing sacrifices, and maintaining the temple rituals.<p><b>Azariah was the father of Johanan</b><br>Azariah, meaning "Yahweh has helped," is a common name in the Old Testament and is often associated with individuals who played significant roles in Israel's history. In this genealogical context, Azariah is a link in the chain of priestly succession. The name itself reflects a reliance on divine assistance, which is fitting for a priestly figure. The mention of Azariah in this lineage highlights the continuity of God's covenant with Israel, as the priesthood was integral to the nation's spiritual life. Johanan, meaning "Yahweh is gracious," continues this line, suggesting a legacy of divine favor and grace. This lineage not only establishes historical continuity but also points to the theological themes of God's faithfulness and the importance of the priestly role in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahimaaz.htm">Ahimaaz</a></b><br>A priestly figure in the lineage of Levi, specifically from the line of Eleazar, son of Aaron.

While scholars debate whether the messenger and the priestly Ahimaaz are the same man, the shared name underscores a reputation for faithfulness&#8212;exactly what God required of priests (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording, &#8220;Ahimaaz was the father of Azariah,&#8221; the Chronicler reminds the post-exilic community that God preserved an unbroken, literal line of servants even through exile (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-10.htm">1 Chronicles 9:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: in seasons of upheaval, God still safeguards those called to serve Him, just as He preserved Ahimaaz&#8217;s line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Azariah was the father of Johanan</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Azariah&#8221; recurs often among priests and kings, but here the focus is a real individual who physically handed the priestly responsibility to his son (see the pattern in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10&#8211;15</a>). This fulfills God&#8217;s covenant promise that Aaron&#8217;s descendants would minister &#8220;forever&#8221; before Him (<a href="/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/4-2.htm">1 Kings 4:2</a> mentions an Azariah son of Zadok who served as a priest under Solomon. Whether or not this is the same man, the record highlights God raising priests during Israel&#8217;s golden era and afterward.<p>&#8226; The next link&#8212;&#8220;Johanan&#8221;&#8212;connects to <a href="/nehemiah/12-22.htm">Nehemiah 12:22&#8211;23</a>, where post-exilic leaders trace their credentials back to this very line, validating temple worship after captivity.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: generational faithfulness matters. Just as Azariah invested in Johanan, believing parents and mentors today pass on a living heritage of worship (<a href="/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-9.htm">1 Chronicles 6:9</a> is more than a dry list; it testifies that God literally preserved the priestly line from Ahimaaz to Azariah to Johanan, ensuring that worship remained anchored in His revealed order. Their names model faithfulness across generations, assuring readers that the Lord who kept His promise to Aaron still keeps His promises to us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ahimaaz</span>.

He is not to be identified with Solomon's" officer" in Naphtali (<a href="/1_kings/4-15.htm">1 Kings 4:15</a>). Azariah. As above said, it is almost without a doubt after this <span class="cmt_word">Azariah</span> (<a href="/1_kings/4-2.htm">1 Kings 4:2</a>) that the parenthetical comment of next verse should be read. Again, this Azariah must not be identified with him of the time of King Uzziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17, 20</a>), who must have been nearly a century later, and was contemporary with Isaiah, Joel, and Amos. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/6-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ahimaaz</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1463;&#1433;&#1506;&#1463;&#1509;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;a&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
