Their responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, included tasks such as setting it up, taking it down, and transporting it during the Israelites' wilderness journeys. The Holy Place refers to the sacred area within the Tabernacle where only priests could enter, emphasizing the Levites' role in maintaining the sanctity and order of worship. This division of labor highlights the importance of holiness and order in worship, as seen in <a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>, where God assigns specific duties to the Levites.<p><b>and, under their brothers the descendants of Aaron</b><br>The descendants of Aaron, Moses' brother, were designated as the priestly line within the tribe of Levi. This phrase underscores the hierarchical structure within the Levitical duties, where the Levites served under the authority of the Aaronic priests. This structure ensured that the worship and sacrifices were conducted according to divine instructions, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28-29</a>. The Aaronic priesthood is a type of Christ, who is our High Priest, as explained in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>, emphasizing the mediatory role between God and His people.<p><b>the service of the house of the LORD</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, which replaced the Tabernacle as the central place of worship. The Levites' service included various tasks such as assisting in sacrifices, maintaining the Temple, and leading worship through music and song, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/25.htm">1 Chronicles 25</a>. This service was crucial for the spiritual life of Israel, ensuring that worship was conducted in a manner pleasing to God. The Temple itself is a foreshadowing of the ultimate dwelling place of God with His people, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the Temple in <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service in the temple.

The law respecting the sacred tent was naturally applied to the future Temple. It is hardly fair to say, with Reuss, that "in the perspective of the author the Tabernacle of David and the Temple of Solomon were confounded with each other." In <a href="/context/1_chronicles/16-37.htm" title="So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brothers, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:">1Chronicles 16:37-39</a>, the chronicler has clearly distinguished two sacred tents: that of the Ark on Mount Zion, and the ancient sanctuary at Gibeon. Throughout that lengthy narrative of the transfer of the Ark, the Temple is not mentioned at all. And if in <a href="/1_chronicles/23-28.htm" title="Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;">1Chronicles 23:28</a> David speaks of "courts" and "chambers," that only shows that the king meant his assignation of the duties of the Levites to be permanent. Nor will it make much difference if we allow that the writer, in speaking of David's tent, has used language more applicable to the Temple of Solomon. The functions of the Levites in both would be essentially the same. The great historian Ewald believed the whole section, <a href="/1_chronicles/23-24.htm" title="These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.">1Chronicles 23:24</a> to <a href="/1_chronicles/24-31.htm" title="These likewise cast lots over against their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brothers.">1Chronicles 24:31</a> to be an authentic extract from "the Book of Origins," which he refers to the early years of Solomon's reign. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Keep the charge of the tabernacle... holy place... sons of Aaron</span>.
