These men were not only skilled in battle but also loyal to David, reflecting the importance of strong leadership and unity. The term "mighty men" (Hebrew: "Gibborim") indicates their valor and prowess. Their exploits are detailed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/2_samuel/23.htm">2 Samuel 23</a>, highlighting their significance in Israel's history.<p><b>who, together with all Israel</b><br>This emphasizes the collective effort in supporting David's kingship. It wasn't just the mighty men but all of Israel that played a part in strengthening his rule. This unity among the tribes was essential for the stability and expansion of the kingdom. It reflects the broader biblical theme of community and cooperation among God's people.<p><b>bolstered and strengthened his kingdom</b><br>The mighty men and the people of Israel fortified David's rule, ensuring its stability and growth. This strengthening was both military and political, as David consolidated power and expanded his influence.

God's covenant with David, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, promised an everlasting dynasty. This phrase reassures that David's reign was not merely a result of human effort but was orchestrated by divine will, aligning with God's overarching plan for Israel.
