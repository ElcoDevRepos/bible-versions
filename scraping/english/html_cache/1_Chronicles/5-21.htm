Their territory was east of Gilead, in the region of modern-day Jordan. The seizing of livestock indicates a significant victory over the Hagrites, reflecting the common practice of taking spoils of war. This act demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites victory over their enemies when they were obedient to Him.<p><b>50,000 camels,</b><br>Camels were valuable assets in ancient times, especially for nomadic tribes like the Hagrites. They were essential for transportation and trade across the desert regions. The large number of camels seized signifies the wealth and resources of the Hagrites and the magnitude of the victory for the Israelites.<p><b>250,000 sheep,</b><br>Sheep were a primary source of wealth and sustenance, providing wool, milk, and meat. The vast number of sheep taken underscores the prosperity of the Hagrites and the extent of the plunder. This also reflects the pastoral lifestyle of the region and the importance of livestock in the economy.<p><b>and 2,000 donkeys.</b><br>Donkeys were crucial for agricultural work and transportation. The capture of donkeys further highlights the comprehensive nature of the victory. In biblical symbolism, donkeys often represent service and humility, contrasting with the warlike nature of the conquest.<p><b>They also took 100,000 captives,</b><br>Taking captives was a common practice in ancient warfare, often used to increase a tribe's labor force or as leverage in negotiations. The large number of captives indicates the scale of the conflict and the dominance of the Israelites over the Hagrites. This event can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to expand Israel's territory and influence, as well as a reminder of the consequences of opposing God's chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_reubenites,_gadites,_and_the_half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">The Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>These tribes of Israel were involved in the battle against the Hagrites.

Their victory, including this vast plunder, shows the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness to those who rely on Him. The pattern echoes <a href="/numbers/31-9.htm">Numbers 31:9</a>, where Israel took Midianite herds after Moses&#8217; command, and <a href="/joshua/22-8.htm">Joshua 22:8</a>, where returning warriors carried &#8220;abundant livestock&#8221; home. God&#8217;s people acting in faith, not mere force, explains the outcome.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>50,000 camels</b><p>Camels were strategic assets for transport and trade. This enormous number underlines the scale of God&#8217;s provision. Compare <a href="/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>, where Abraham&#8217;s servant loads &#8220;ten camels&#8221; for one diplomatic mission, and <a href="/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a>, when God restores Job with &#8220;6,000 camels&#8221;&#8212;already considered phenomenal. Here, the Lord grants more than eight times Job&#8217;s allotment, emphasizing how fully He can equip His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>250,000 sheep</b><p>Sheep supplied food, clothing, and sacrifices; their sheer quantity highlights overwhelming abundance. In <a href="/2_chronicles/35-7.htm">2 Chronicles 35:7</a>, King Josiah&#8217;s national Passover used 30,000 lambs, yet the eastern tribes captured over eight times that amount in a single campaign. <a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10</a> reminds us, &#8220;every beast of the forest is Mine&#8230; the cattle on a thousand hills.&#8221; By handing over this flock, God displays ownership and generosity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>2,000 donkeys</b><p>Donkeys carried burdens, enabling commerce and agriculture. <a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a> counts &#8220;500 female donkeys&#8221; among Job&#8217;s great wealth; Solomon valued donkeys for royal transport (<a href="/1_kings/1-33.htm">1 Kings 1:33</a>). The 2,000 taken here therefore signify God&#8217;s enabling of the tribes to develop their Trans-Jordan territory, mirroring <a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-11</a>, where the Lord promised ready-made resources in the Promised Land.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They also took 100,000 captives</b><p>Captives meant both manpower and political leverage. While <a href="/2_chronicles/28-8.htm">2 Chronicles 28:8</a> records Israel later taking 200,000 captives&#8212;only to release them at a prophet&#8217;s rebuke&#8212;this earlier event carries no such censure, indicating God&#8217;s sanction at this moment. The text underscores that victory and its aftermath were direct gifts from God: &#8220;the battle was God&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). Yet verse 22 foreshadows future judgment: the tribes would eventually be &#8220;taken into exile,&#8221; warning that ongoing faithfulness is essential.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/5-21.htm">1 Chronicles 5:21</a> shows the magnitude of God&#8217;s deliverance for tribes that trusted Him: vast herds, strategic animals, and a huge prisoner count. Each detail underscores literal, measurable blessings flowing from reliance on the Lord. At the same time, the passage quietly cautions that continued obedience is vital, for the God who grants victory also disciplines His people when they turn away.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of men</span>;
