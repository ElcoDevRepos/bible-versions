The name Shitrai is unique in the Bible, and his designation as "the Sharonite" suggests he was from the region of Sharon, a fertile plain known for its beauty and agricultural productivity. This area, located between the Mediterranean Sea and the central hill country of Israel, was ideal for grazing livestock. The mention of Shitrai highlights the organized and structured nature of David's kingdom, where specific individuals were appointed to oversee different aspects of the nation's resources.<p><b>was in charge of the herds grazing in Sharon.</b><br>The herds grazing in Sharon would have been significant for the economy and sustenance of the kingdom. Sharon's lush pastures made it an excellent location for raising cattle, which were essential for food, sacrifices, and trade. The role of overseeing these herds would have required diligence and expertise, ensuring the animals were healthy and the resources were managed efficiently. This reflects the broader biblical theme of stewardship, where individuals are entrusted with responsibilities to manage God's creation wisely.<p><b>Shaphat son of Adlai</b><br>Shaphat, identified as the son of Adlai, is another figure entrusted with the care of the king's herds. The mention of his lineage, "son of Adlai," is a common biblical practice to establish identity and heritage. This practice underscores the importance of family and lineage in Israelite society, where one's ancestry often determined social standing and roles within the community. Shaphat's role, like Shitrai's, indicates a structured approach to governance, with specific individuals appointed to manage different regions and resources.<p><b>was in charge of the herds in the valleys.</b><br>The valleys mentioned here likely refer to the low-lying areas of Israel, which were also suitable for grazing due to their fertile soil and access to water. These regions would have been crucial for supporting the kingdom's livestock, providing necessary resources for the people and the royal household. The division of responsibilities between Shitrai and Shaphat suggests a well-organized system of resource management, reflecting the wisdom and administrative skills attributed to King David's reign. This organization can be seen as a precursor to the more extensive administrative systems developed under Solomon, David's son, and successor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shitrai_the_sharonite.htm">Shitrai the Sharonite</a></b><br>A steward responsible for managing the herds in the region of Sharon.

Entrusting one man with all the cattle there underscores both the productivity of the region and the need for wise oversight (<a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that God values faithful stewardship in ordinary work. Just as David appointed Shitrai, the Lord appoints believers to watch over what He&#8217;s given (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming Shitrai, Scripture affirms that individual service&#8212;however &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221;&#8212;matters to God, echoing the way Paul later greets lesser-known coworkers (<a href="/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shaphat son of Adlai was in charge of the herds in the valleys</b><p>&#8220;Shaphat son of Adlai was in charge of the herds in the valleys.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The &#8220;valleys&#8221; likely refer to the fertile lowlands between the central hill country and the coastal plain, areas ideal for grazing (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/23-1.htm">1 Samuel 23:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Shaphat&#8217;s role complements Shitrai&#8217;s, illustrating a coordinated system that protected national resources (<a href="/proverbs/14-4.htm">Proverbs 14:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p>&#8226; The name Shaphat means &#8220;he judges,&#8221; hinting that oversight involves accountability. Livestock represented wealth (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>; <a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>), so honest supervision safeguarded both economy and covenant blessings (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>).<p>&#8226; By placing specific men over different regions, David models decentralized leadership&#8212;entrusting capable people, yet retaining overall unity (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>; 1 Chron 27:34).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/27-29.htm">1 Chronicles 27:29</a> records two trusted officials managing royal herds in two distinct, fertile regions.
