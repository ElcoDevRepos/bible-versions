This phrase highlights his direct communication with God, a privilege and responsibility of his kingship. It reflects the biblical principle of personal accountability before God, a theme prevalent throughout the scriptures.<p><b>&#8220;Was it not I who gave the order to count the people?</b><br>David acknowledges his role in the census, which was against God's will. In the ancient Near Eastern context, censuses were often conducted for military or taxation purposes, but in Israel, they were to be commanded by God. This act of counting the people without divine instruction was seen as a lack of trust in God's provision and protection.<p><b>I am the one who has sinned and acted wickedly.</b><br>David's confession is a model of repentance, taking full responsibility for his actions. This aligns with the biblical theme of repentance, where acknowledgment of sin is the first step towards restoration. David's admission contrasts with other biblical figures who deflected blame, emphasizing the importance of personal accountability.<p><b>But these sheep, what have they done?</b><br>David refers to the people of Israel as "sheep," a common biblical metaphor for God's people, highlighting their vulnerability and need for guidance. This imagery is consistent with passages like <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where God is depicted as a shepherd. David's plea underscores his role as a shepherd-king, responsible for the welfare of his people.<p><b>O LORD my God,</b><br>The use of "LORD" (Yahweh) signifies a personal and covenantal relationship with God. This phrase reflects the intimate and reverent relationship David has with God, acknowledging His sovereignty and faithfulness to His covenant promises.<p><b>please let Your hand fall upon me and my father&#8217;s house,</b><br>David offers himself and his family as a substitute for the punishment, demonstrating a willingness to bear the consequences of his actions. This self-sacrificial attitude is a type of Christ, who ultimately bore the sins of humanity. It also reflects the biblical principle of leadership, where leaders are accountable for their actions and their impact on others.<p><b>but do not let this plague remain upon Your people.&#8221;</b><br>David intercedes for the people, asking God to spare them from the consequences of his sin. This intercession is a foreshadowing of Christ's role as the ultimate intercessor. The plea for the removal of the plague highlights the theme of divine mercy and the power of prayer in seeking God's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who ordered the census, recognizing his sin and pleading for mercy on behalf of his people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord to whom David prays, acknowledging His authority and seeking His mercy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_census.htm">The Census</a></b><br>An event initiated by David that led to God's displeasure and a subsequent plague on Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plague.htm">The Plague</a></b><br>A divine punishment sent by God as a consequence of David's sin, affecting the people of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>Referred to as "sheep" by David, they suffer due to the king's actions, highlighting the communal impact of sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_weight_of_leadership.htm">The Weight of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders bear significant responsibility for their actions, which can have widespread consequences.
