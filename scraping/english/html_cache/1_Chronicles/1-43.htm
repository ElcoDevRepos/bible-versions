The Edomites were often in conflict with Israel, and their kingship predates the establishment of the monarchy in Israel. This historical context highlights the longstanding enmity between the two nations, which is rooted in the sibling rivalry between Esau and Jacob. The mention of Edomite kings serves as a reminder of the fulfillment of God's prophecy to Rebekah that "two nations are in your womb" (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>).<p><b>before any king reigned over the Israelites</b><br>This phrase underscores the timeline of governance in the region, indicating that Edom had established a monarchy before Israel. The Israelites were initially led by judges and only later demanded a king, leading to the anointing of Saul as the first king. This distinction emphasizes the unique theocratic leadership of Israel, where God was considered the ultimate ruler until the people's insistence on having a human king (1 Samuel 8).<p><b>Bela son of Beor</b><br>Bela is listed as the first king of Edom, and his lineage is noted, which was a common practice to establish legitimacy and authority. The name Beor is also associated with Balaam, the prophet in <a href="/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-24</a>, though it is unclear if there is a direct connection. The mention of Bela highlights the historical record-keeping of the Edomites and their structured governance.<p><b>His city was named Dinhabah</b><br>Dinhabah, the city associated with King Bela, is not well-documented archaeologically, but its mention indicates the presence of urban centers in Edom. The naming of cities after rulers or significant figures was a common practice in the ancient Near East, reflecting the ruler's influence and legacy.

Edom, descended from Esau (<a href="/genesis/36-1.htm">Genesis 36:1</a>), occupied the rugged territory south-east of the Dead Sea.<p>&#8226; Mentioning Edom&#8217;s kings reminds readers that God had allowed Esau&#8217;s line to develop its own kingdom long before Israel&#8217;s monarchy. Compare <a href="/genesis/36-31.htm">Genesis 36:31</a>, where the same list appears, and <a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4-5</a>, which shows the LORD protecting Edom&#8217;s inheritance even while Israel journeyed wilderness-bound.<p>&#8226; This factual statement underscores both divine sovereignty and the reliability of Scripture&#8217;s historical record (<a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>before any king reigned over the Israelites</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;&#8230;before any king reigned over the Israelites&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-43.htm">1 Chronicles 1:43</a>)<p>&#8226; Israel would not receive a king until Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), centuries after Edom&#8217;s line began. The chronicler quietly reminds God&#8217;s people that the LORD&#8217;s timing differs from human expectation (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Edom&#8217;s earlier monarchy never meant covenant priority; rather, Israel&#8217;s theocratic period under judges displayed God&#8217;s direct rule (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18</a>). Only when Israel asked for a king &#8220;like all the other nations&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5-7</a>) did the LORD grant one&#8212;foreshadowing the perfect King in the house of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-15</a> had already anticipated a future Israelite king, proving God&#8217;s plan was unfolding purposefully even while Edom flourished politically.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bela son of Beor</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Bela son of Beor.&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-43.htm">1 Chronicles 1:43</a>)<p>&#8226; Bela is recorded as Edom&#8217;s first king. His father, Beor, shares a name with Balaam&#8217;s father (<a href="/numbers/22-5.htm">Numbers 22:5</a>), yet Scripture offers no indication they are the same man; the similarity simply shows common naming practices.<p>&#8226; By naming both Bela and Beor, the chronicler roots Edom&#8217;s monarchy in real individuals, reinforcing Scripture&#8217;s trustworthiness (<a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The record also illustrates that God tracks the rise and fall of nations (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>), even those outside the covenant line, revealing His universal governance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His city was named Dinhabah</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;His city was named Dinhabah.&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-43.htm">1 Chronicles 1:43</a>)<p>&#8226; A king&#8217;s &#8220;city&#8221; served as his seat of power. Dinhabah&#8217;s precise location is uncertain today, but its mention indicates an organized administrative center, not a nomadic clan.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/36-32.htm">Genesis 36:32</a> repeats this detail, corroborating the chronicler&#8217;s source material. The repetition in two separate books emphasizes that every place matters to God&#8217;s recorded history (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>).<p>&#8226; Identifying Dinhabah contrasts Edom&#8217;s early urban development with Israel&#8217;s later centralized government at Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-7</a>), highlighting the LORD&#8217;s unique path for His chosen people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/1-43.htm">1 Chronicles 1:43</a> points out that Edom enjoyed a structured monarchy, starting with Bela of Dinhabah, long before Israel received a king.
