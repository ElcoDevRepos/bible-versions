The genealogy in <a href="/1_chronicles/8.htm">1 Chronicles 8</a> highlights the lineage of Benjamin, emphasizing the importance of this tribe in Israel's history. The Benjamites were known for their warrior skills and played a significant role in the early monarchy of Israel, particularly during the reign of King Saul, who was also from the tribe of Benjamin.<p><b>Eber, Misham, Shemed:</b><br>These names are part of the genealogical record, which serves to establish the historical and familial connections within the tribe of Benjamin. Eber, Misham, and Shemed are not widely mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, indicating that they may not have been prominent figures in biblical narratives. However, their inclusion underscores the importance of family lineage and heritage in Israelite society.<p><b>(who built Ono and Lod with its villages):</b><br>Ono and Lod are towns located in the region of Benjamin. Ono is mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/6-2.htm">Nehemiah 6:2</a> as a place where Nehemiah was invited to meet with his adversaries, indicating its continued significance during the post-exilic period. Lod, known in the New Testament as Lydda, is referenced in <a href="/acts/9-32.htm">Acts 9:32-35</a>, where Peter heals a paralytic, demonstrating its ongoing importance in biblical history. The construction of these towns and their villages by Shemed suggests a period of expansion and settlement, reflecting the growth and establishment of the tribe of Benjamin in the land of Israel. This development also highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites a land of their own, as seen in the broader narrative of the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elpaal.htm">Elpaal</a></b><br>A descendant of Benjamin, Elpaal is mentioned as the father of several sons, including those who were builders of cities.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eber.htm">Eber</a></b><br>One of the sons of Elpaal, though not much is detailed about him in this passage, his inclusion signifies his role in the lineage of Benjamin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/misham.htm">Misham</a></b><br>Another son of Elpaal, like Eber, his specific contributions are not detailed here, but his mention is important for genealogical records.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shemed.htm">Shemed</a></b><br>A son of Elpaal noted for his role in building the cities of Ono and Lod, indicating his significance in the development of these areas.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/ono_and_lod.htm">Ono and Lod</a></b><br>Cities built by Shemed, these locations are significant in the history of Israel.
