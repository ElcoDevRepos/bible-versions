The "king" mentioned here is likely the Ammonite king or possibly a symbolic representation of their leadership. In ancient Near Eastern culture, taking a king's crown symbolized the transfer of power and authority. This act signifies David's complete victory and dominance over the Ammonites, fulfilling God's promise to give Israel victory over their enemies.<p><b>It was found to weigh a talent of gold and was set with precious stones,</b><br>A talent of gold is a significant weight, approximately 75 pounds or 34 kilograms, indicating the immense wealth and opulence of the Ammonite kingdom. The crown's adornment with precious stones highlights its value and the prosperity of the region. This detail underscores the material wealth that David acquired through his military campaigns, which was often seen as a sign of divine favor and blessing.<p><b>and it was placed on David&#8217;s head.</b><br>Placing the crown on David's head symbolizes his rightful claim to the conquered territory and his role as the divinely appointed king of Israel. This act can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate kingship of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the King of Kings. David's victories and his establishment of a strong kingdom prefigure the eternal kingdom of Christ.<p><b>And David took a great amount of plunder from the city.</b><br>The plunder taken from Rabbah represents the spoils of war, which were common in ancient military conquests. This wealth would have been used to support the kingdom of Israel, fund future military campaigns, and contribute to the construction of the temple, which David's son Solomon would later build. The acquisition of plunder also demonstrates God's provision for His people through the victories He grants them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his leadership, military conquests, and heart for God.

Two difficulties present themselves in this verse, viz. the reported weight of this crown, and the uncertainty as to what head it was from which David took it. Whatever was its weight, if David's head was able to sustain it for a minute or two, the head of the King of the Ammonites might also occasionally have borne it. Yet it would scarcely be likely that the King of the Ammonites would have so ponderous a crown (calculated at a weight of a hundred and fourteen pounds Troy, or a little more or less than one hundredweight) as one of ordinary wear, or that he would have one of extraordinary wear on his head precisely at such a juncture. Both of these difficulties will remove if we suppose that the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, instead of meaning <span class="cmt_word">their king</span>, is the name of the Ammonitish and Moabitish idol (<span class="accented">i.q.</span> Moloch), and which we find (Authorized Version) in <a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>, and probably (though not Authorized Version) in <a href="/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1, 3</a>, and <a href="/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>. The Septuagint treats the word thus. The point, however, cannot be considered settled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/20-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;w&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
