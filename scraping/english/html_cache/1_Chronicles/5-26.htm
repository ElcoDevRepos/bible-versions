Pul is another name for Tiglath-pileser III, a powerful Assyrian ruler known for his military campaigns and expansion of the Assyrian Empire. This event is a fulfillment of warnings given to Israel about the consequences of their disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>). The stirring of Pul's spirit indicates divine intervention, showing that God uses even foreign powers to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>(that is, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria)</b><br>Tiglath-pileser III reigned from 745 to 727 BC and was a significant figure in Assyrian history, known for his administrative reforms and military conquests. His campaigns against Israel are documented in both biblical and Assyrian records, providing historical corroboration of the biblical narrative. This identification clarifies the historical context and aligns with the accounts in <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a> and <a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>, where Tiglath-pileser's interactions with Israel are detailed.<p><b>to take the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile</b><br>These tribes were located east of the Jordan River, in a region vulnerable to external threats. Their exile marks the beginning of the Assyrian captivity, a pivotal moment in Israel's history that underscores the consequences of their idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-25.htm">1 Chronicles 5:25</a>). This event serves as a warning and a call to repentance, illustrating the seriousness of turning away from God.<p><b>And he brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river of Gozan</b><br>These locations are in the region of Mesopotamia, within the Assyrian Empire. Archaeological evidence and Assyrian records confirm the existence of these places, providing a geographical context for the exile. The dispersion of the tribes to these areas reflects the Assyrian policy of relocating conquered peoples to prevent rebellion and assimilate them into the empire. This relocation fulfills prophecies of dispersion found in <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>.<p><b>where they remain to this day</b><br>This phrase indicates the lasting impact of the exile on these tribes, suggesting that at the time of writing, they had not returned to their ancestral lands. It highlights the enduring consequences of disobedience and the loss of identity and heritage.

In <a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm" title="And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.">2Kings 15:19</a> we read that, "Pul king of Assyria came against the land," in the reign of Menahem, who recognised the Assyrian monarch as his suzerain, and paid a tribute of 1,000 talents of silver. Now Tiglath-pileser II. actually claims to have received tribute of Menahem (<span class= "ital">Menahimmu</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> P-l appears to have been the original name of Tiglath-pileser, which, upon his accession to the throne of Assyria (745 B.C.), he discarded for that of the great king who had ruled the country four centuries before his time. The name P-l has been identified by Dr. Schrader with the Porus of Ptolemy's Canon, <span class= "ital">Por</span> being the Persian pronunciation of P-l. The Syriac here omits "P-l king of Assyria." The LXX. (Vat.) has <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>, and the Arabic <span class= "ital">Balaq.</span> Perhaps the chronicler meant to indicate the identity of P-l and Tiglath: "The spirit of Pul <span class= "ital">and </span>(<span class= "ital">=</span> that is) the spirit of Tiglath, and <span class= "ital">he</span> carried them away." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pul</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Tilgath-pilneser</span>. These two were chosen ministers of God's will, if not ministers of himself. We can identify the date of this punishment which befell the transgressing Israelites east of the Jordan. The visit of the former, in the reign of Menahem (<a href="/2_kings/15-15.htm">2 Kings 15:15-20</a>), may be interpreted and might have operated as a lesson and a warning. He was bought off with a thousand talents of silver. It seems to be said with significance," So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land." It was in the reign of Pekah, the usurping successor of Menahem's son Pekahiah, that the completer punishment fell, and Tilgath-pilneser effected the captivity spoken of here and in <a href="/2_kings/15-27.htm">2 Kings 15:27-29</a>. The name <span class="accented">Pul</span> cannot, it would appear, be a pure Assyrian name, and there is reason to think it may be identified with <span class="accented">Vul-lush</span> (grandson of the Shalmaneser who warred with Benhadad, etc.), a name found on Assyrian monuments, and belonging to a king who reigned at Calah, <span class="date">B.C. 8004750</span> (see art. "Pul," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). <span class="accented">Tilqath-pilneser</span> (see notes on ver. 6) was probably the founder of the lower dynasty of Assyria, and first king of the new empire. His first invasion was one chiefly of Israel and Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>). His second was of a much more significant character. Called in to aid Judah under Ahaz against Pekah of Israel and Rezin of Syria in alliance, he both conquered these latter and brought into vassalage Judah itself (<a href="/2_kings/15-37.htm">2 Kings 15:37</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9, 10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6-8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Halah; Habor Hara; Gozan</span>. This enumeration exceeds that of <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a> by the addition of <span class="accented">Hara</span>, important as helping with consistent witness to the antiquity of the region described. <span class="accented">Halah</span> (<span class="accented">not</span> the "Calah" of <a href="/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11</a>) is believed to be identifiable with <span class="accented">Chalcitis</span>, its verbal resemblance to which comes out a little more evidently in its Hebrew form (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>). A trace of it possibly remains in the name of a hill, <span class="accented">Gla</span>, on the <span class="accented">Khabour</span>, <span class="accented">i.q. Habor</span> of this passage, an important tributary of the Euphrates, and not the "Chebar" of Ezekiel. This name <span class="accented">Khabour</span> is found in an Assyrian inscription dating upwards of eight centuries before Christ. The mention of Habor in <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a> and 2 Kings 18:11 is, in the Authorized Version, made to convey the impression of a place "by" the "river of Gozan," instead of being, what the Hebrew says, "the river of Gozan." Here, on the other hand, <span class="accented">Gozan</span> is, in the Authorized Version, incorrectly translated as a river itself, instead of the region of a river. It is, according to the testimony of Layard ('Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 270-312), a remarkably fertile tract, being the <span class="accented">Gauzanitis</span> of Ptolemy, and substantially the Mygdonia of Polybius and Strabo. <span class="accented">Hara</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, with little doubt, the same as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">Haran</span>, or <span class="accented">Charran</span> (<a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>), the ancient adopted home of Abraham, in Padan-aram, in Mesopotamia, on the Belik, a small tributary of the Euphrates. It is the Greek <span class="accented">Carrhae</span> of Strabo and Polybius. These four names purport to give us, probably in brief, the information that those of the Captivity here alluded to were divided - some to settle at Halab on one river, some in Hara on another, and the rest in the district called <span class="accented">Gauzanitis.</span> The region called Halah and that called Gau-zanitis, however, were both watered by the Khabour, and therefore the insertion of the name Haran where it is inserted occasions some difficulty. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1436;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">stirred up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#8216;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
