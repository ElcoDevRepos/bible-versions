It is often associated with the region of Judah. The name Etam means "lair of wild beasts," which may indicate its rugged terrain. This location is significant as it reflects the expansion and settlement patterns of the tribe of Simeon within the territory of Judah.<p><b>Ain</b><br>Ain, meaning "spring" or "fountain," suggests a location with a water source, which would have been crucial for sustaining life in ancient times. This village is also listed among the cities of the tribe of Simeon in <a href="/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7</a>. The presence of a spring would have made Ain a valuable settlement for agriculture and livestock.<p><b>Rimmon</b><br>Rimmon, meaning "pomegranate," is another village associated with the tribe of Simeon. The pomegranate is a symbol of fertility and abundance in the Bible, often used in the decoration of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-18.htm">1 Kings 7:18</a>). This village's name may reflect the agricultural richness of the area or the presence of pomegranate trees.<p><b>Tochen</b><br>Tochen is a lesser-known village, with limited references in the Bible. Its inclusion in this list highlights the comprehensive nature of the genealogical records in Chronicles, emphasizing the importance of each settlement in the tribal inheritance. The name Tochen may mean "measured" or "balanced," possibly indicating a well-planned or strategically located village.<p><b>and Ashan</b><br>Ashan, meaning "smoke" or "cloud," is another village of the Simeonites. It is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-42.htm">Joshua 15:42 and 19</a>:7, indicating its role in the tribal allotments. The name could suggest a location known for its high elevation or a place where sacrifices were made, producing smoke.<p><b>five towns&#8212;</b><br>The mention of five towns underscores the completeness and sufficiency of the Simeonite settlements within Judah's territory. The number five can symbolize grace or God's provision in biblical numerology. This enumeration reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to provide land for His people, as seen in the broader narrative of the conquest and settlement of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/etam.htm">Etam</a></b><br>A village mentioned in the territory of the tribe of Simeon.

God is charting real families in real places, showing where Simeon&#8217;s descendants settled within Judah&#8217;s territory (cf. <a href="/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/4-28.htm">1 Chronicles 4:28, 31</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Villages&#8221; points to satellite communities around larger towns. Scripture repeatedly notes such clusters&#8212;e.g., &#8220;Achzib with its villages&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>)&#8212;to underline how the Lord provided both city centers and rural support for His people.<p>&#8226; By recording them, the Spirit emphasizes covenant faithfulness: every settlement, however small, matters to God (cf. <a href="/luke/12-6.htm">Luke 12:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were Etam</b><p>&#8226; Etam lay roughly 10 miles southwest of Bethlehem.

The number five often signals completeness in smaller units (e.g., <a href="/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>, <a href="/leviticus/26-8.htm">Leviticus 26:8</a>), hinting that this sub-cluster rounded out Simeon&#8217;s settlements.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/4-32.htm">1 Chronicles 4:32</a> grounds lofty promises in down-to-earth geography. By cataloging Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Tochen, and Ashan, Scripture confirms God&#8217;s faithfulness to every clan, reminds believers that no place is too remote for His care, and showcases how covenant life&#8212;worship, work, water, and walls&#8212;flourished under His watchful eye.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">And their villages.</span>--This belongs to <a href="/1_chronicles/4-31.htm" title="And at Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusim, and at Bethbirei, and at Shaaraim.
