In this passage, it refers to a Levitical city in the territory of Issachar. The name "Ramoth" means "heights" or "high places," which is fitting given its likely elevated location. This city is distinct from Ramoth-Gilead, a more well-known city of refuge located east of the Jordan River. The allocation of cities like Ramoth to the Levites underscores the importance of providing for the priestly tribe, who were responsible for religious duties and had no inheritance of land like the other tribes. This reflects the broader biblical principle of supporting those who serve in spiritual capacities, as seen in passages like <a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>.<p><b>and Anem</b><br>Anem is another Levitical city within the territory of Issachar. The name "Anem" is less frequently mentioned in the Bible, and its exact location is not definitively known today. However, its inclusion in the list of Levitical cities highlights the distribution of these cities across various tribal territories, ensuring that the Levites were integrated throughout Israel. This distribution allowed the Levites to perform their religious duties and teach the Law to the people, as described in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>. The presence of Levitical cities in each tribal area also served as a reminder of the centrality of worship and adherence to God's commandments in the life of Israel.<p><b>together with their pasturelands</b><br>The mention of pasturelands indicates that these cities were not just urban centers but included surrounding lands for grazing livestock. This provision was necessary for the Levites, who, unlike other tribes, did not receive a large inheritance of land. The pasturelands provided sustenance for their families and livestock, ensuring their material needs were met. This arrangement reflects the broader biblical principle of God's provision for those who serve Him, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>, which speaks to the support of those who minister in spiritual matters. The inclusion of pasturelands also emphasizes the agrarian nature of ancient Israelite society, where livestock played a crucial role in daily life and economy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ramoth_in_gilead.htm">Ramoth in Gilead</a></b><br>A city of refuge located in the territory of Gad, east of the Jordan River.

Joshua lists the same allocation with the variant spelling &#8220;Jarmuth&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29</a>). However spelled, it represents:<p>&#8226; A real geographic settlement, demonstrating the concrete fulfillment of God&#8217;s earlier command that Israel provide towns for the Levites (<a href="/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; A reminder that the Levites&#8212;tasked with teaching and worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8-10</a>)&#8212;needed a home base from which to minister.<p>&#8226; An example of God&#8217;s orderliness: every tribe shared in supporting those who served at the tabernacle, echoing the later New-Testament principle that &#8220;the worker is worthy of his wages&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Anem</b><p>Chronicles places &#8220;Anem&#8221; alongside Ramoth, while the parallel in Joshua calls the same town &#8220;En-gannim&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29</a>), showing that Scripture preserves multiple accepted designations of the same site without contradiction. Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; The differing names underline the reliability of the historical record&#8212;multiple witnesses, one truth (compare <a href="/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The inclusion of Anem reinforces how thoroughly God embedded the Levites across Israel so His word would saturate the land (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-7.htm">2 Chronicles 17:7-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Both listings&#8212;Ramoth/Jarmuth and Anem/En-gannim&#8212;testify that the chronicler was not inventing history but carefully preserving it for post-exilic readers who needed assurance that God&#8217;s covenant structure still stood.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Together with their pasturelands</b><p>The phrase completes the thought: &#8220;Ramoth, and Anem, together with their pasturelands&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-73.htm">1 Chronicles 6:73</a>). Pasturelands mattered because:<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2-3</a> required that every Levitical town be ringed by open land for their flocks, guaranteeing daily provision.<p>&#8226; By tying physical sustenance to sacred duty, God wove worship into ordinary life (see <a href="/leviticus/25-34.htm">Leviticus 25:34</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/10-37.htm">Nehemiah 10:37-39</a>).<p>&#8226; The generous allocation urged each tribe to participate in God&#8217;s work. As Paul later tells believers to share &#8220;all good things with the one who teaches&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>), Israel first modeled that pattern through these pastures.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-73.htm">1 Chronicles 6:73</a> records two specific Levitical towns&#8212;Ramoth and Anem&#8212;located in Issachar and endowed with pasturelands. Far from being a throwaway detail, the verse highlights God&#8217;s meticulous faithfulness: He provided real places and real resources so the Levites could fulfill real ministry. The citation of both towns, along with their supporting lands, calls contemporary readers to the same pattern of honoring God&#8217;s servants, trusting Scripture&#8217;s historical precision, and recognizing that every square mile of provision ultimately serves the worship of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 73.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ramoth</span>; called in <a href="/joshua/21-28.htm">Joshua 21:28, 29</a>, Jarmuth; a place of which nothing else is known, but possibly one with Remeth (<a href="/joshua/19-21.htm">Joshua 19:21</a>).
