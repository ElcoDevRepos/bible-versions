Their flight before Israel signifies a decisive victory for David's forces. This event is part of a series of military campaigns led by David to secure Israel's borders and establish dominance over neighboring nations. The Arameans' retreat highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel victory over its enemies, as seen in earlier scriptures such as <a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>. This victory also demonstrates the effectiveness of David's leadership and God's favor upon Israel during his reign.<p><b>and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers</b><br>The mention of charioteers indicates the advanced military technology and tactics employed by the Arameans. Chariots were a formidable component of ancient warfare, often giving armies a significant advantage. The destruction of seven thousand charioteers underscores the scale of the victory and the effectiveness of Israel's forces under David's command. This victory can be seen as a divine intervention, as Israel, traditionally not known for its chariotry, overcame a technologically superior force. This mirrors other biblical accounts where God grants victory against overwhelming odds, such as Gideon's triumph over the Midianites in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>.<p><b>and forty thousand foot soldiers</b><br>The large number of foot soldiers killed further emphasizes the magnitude of the defeat suffered by the Arameans. This substantial loss would have significantly weakened their military capabilities and deterred future aggression against Israel. The scale of the victory is reminiscent of other Old Testament battles where God grants Israel overwhelming success, such as the defeat of the Philistines in <a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7</a>. It also serves as a testament to David's military prowess and the strength of his army, which was unified and empowered under his leadership.<p><b>He also killed Shophach the commander of their army</b><br>The death of Shophach, the commander, is a critical blow to the Aramean forces. In ancient warfare, the loss of a leader often led to disarray and demoralization among the troops. Shophach's death signifies the complete dismantling of the Aramean military structure and leadership. This mirrors the biblical theme of God overthrowing the enemies of His people by removing their leaders, as seen in the defeat of Sisera in <a href="/judges/4.htm">Judges 4</a>. The removal of Shophach can also be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over the spiritual forces of evil, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4-7</a>, where the Messiah is depicted as a conquering king who brings peace and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his military prowess and leadership.

Their retreat shows how God fought for His people, just as He had in earlier victories (<a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24-25</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>; 2 Chron 14:12).<p>&#8226; The flight of a professional army testifies to divine intervention and fulfills the promise that one Israelite could chase a thousand when the LORD was with them (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>; <a href="/joshua/23-10.htm">Joshua 23:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers</b><p>&#8226; Scripture records literal numbers: 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 infantry. Chronicles emphasizes personnel (&#8220;charioteers&#8221;), while the parallel account notes &#8220;700 chariots and 40,000 horsemen&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/10-18.htm">2 Samuel 10:18</a>). Both statements are true&#8212;counting either the crews or the chariots.<p>&#8226; Chariots were the ancient equivalent of armored vehicles (<a href="/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>). Defeating them highlights God&#8217;s power over intimidating technology (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The scale of the victory rivals earlier triumphs: David had already hamstrung 1,000 chariot teams and killed 22,000 Arameans in a previous battle (1 Chron 18:4-6). God now extends that victory, fulfilling <a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>: &#8220;I have cut off all your enemies before you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This judgment also protects Israel&#8217;s neighbors from future Syrian aggression, foreshadowing the Messiah&#8217;s ultimate conquest of evil (<a href="/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9-11</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He also killed Shophach the commander of their army</b><p>&#8226; Removing the general ends the Aramean coalition (cf. <a href="/judges/4-17.htm">Judges 4:17-22</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24</a>). A broken leadership structure means long-term peace for Israel (1 Chron 17:10).<p>&#8226; The personal defeat of Shophach underscores that no human leader can stand against the LORD&#8217;s anointed (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2-6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>).<p>&#8226; After this blow, the Arameans made peace with David and served him (1 Chron 19:19), illustrating <a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>: &#8220;When a man&#8217;s ways please the LORD, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/19-18.htm">1 Chronicles 19:18</a> records a decisive, God-given victory: the hired Aramean army panicked and fled, David&#8217;s forces destroyed their elite chariot corps and vast infantry, and their commander fell. The passage demonstrates the LORD&#8217;s faithfulness to defend His covenant people, the certainty of His promises, and the futility of opposing His rule.
