He was a descendant of Eleazar, the third son of Aaron, which placed him in a significant priestly lineage. Zadok's role in assisting David highlights the importance of maintaining the priestly order and the continuity of worship practices. His involvement underscores the collaboration between the king and the priesthood in organizing temple service, reflecting the theocratic nature of Israel's governance. Zadok's loyalty to David during Absalom's rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-29</a>) further solidified his position and influence.<p><b>and Ithamar&#8217;s descendant Ahimelech</b><br>Ahimelech, a descendant of Ithamar, Aaron's fourth son, represents the other major priestly line. The inclusion of both Eleazar's and Ithamar's descendants in this task demonstrates a balance and unity within the priesthood, ensuring that both lines had a role in temple service. Historically, the priesthood had been dominated by Eleazar's line, but David's decision to involve Ithamar's descendants reflects a desire for inclusivity and shared responsibility. This decision may also have been influenced by the need to prevent rivalry and maintain peace within the religious leadership.<p><b>David divided them according to the offices of their service</b><br>David's division of the priests into different offices was a strategic move to organize temple worship efficiently. This division ensured that the duties were distributed evenly, allowing for a continuous and orderly worship system. The organization into 24 courses, as detailed later in the chapter, allowed for a structured rotation of service, which was crucial for managing the large number of priests. This system of division is echoed in the New Testament, where Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist, is described as serving in the temple according to his division (<a href="/luke/1-5.htm">Luke 1:5-9</a>). David's actions here prefigure the order and structure that Christ would bring to His church, emphasizing the importance of orderly worship and service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who organized the priestly divisions.

Just as <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a> reminds us, &#8220;victory is won through many counselors,&#8221; the king seeks godly assistance for a task that affects the entire nation&#8217;s worship. This collaboration underscores that spiritual leadership benefits from shared wisdom (<a href="/acts/15-6.htm">Acts 15:6&#8211;7</a> shows the same principle in the early church).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eleazar&#8217;s descendant Zadok</b><p>Zadok, already prominent as priest (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>), represents the faithful line of Eleazar, Aaron&#8217;s third son (<a href="/numbers/3-4.htm">Numbers 3:4</a>). His presence signals continuity with Moses&#8217; instructions and the promise in <a href="/1_samuel/2-35.htm">1 Samuel 2:35</a> that God would raise up a &#8220;faithful priest.&#8221; When Solomon later confirms Zadok as high priest (<a href="/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>), it completes a thread of divine approval that begins here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ithamar&#8217;s descendant Ahimelech</b><p>Ahimelech stands for the surviving branch of Ithamar (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). Though Eli&#8217;s family from this line had stumbled (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30&#8211;34</a>), God does not discard Ithamar entirely. By including Ahimelech, David shows that grace can redeem a troubled heritage (<a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>), keeping both priestly houses engaged in service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>David divided them</b><p>The king organizes&#8212;he doesn&#8217;t create&#8212;priestly authority.

This mirrors Moses structuring Israel in <a href="/bsb/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a> and prefigures Paul&#8217;s exhortation that &#8220;everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>According to the offices of their service</b><p>Each priestly group receives defined duties: offerings, Temple guardianship, and festival ministry (<a href="/2_chronicles/8-14.htm">2 Chronicles 8:14</a>). Clear roles prevent rivalry and ensure continual worship, much like the New Testament model where every believer has a distinct gift &#8220;for the common good&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4&#8211;7</a>). By anchoring ministry to office, David protects both reverence and efficiency in God&#8217;s house.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3</a> shows David, guided by trusted priests, arranging Israel&#8217;s worship with order, balance, and continuity.
