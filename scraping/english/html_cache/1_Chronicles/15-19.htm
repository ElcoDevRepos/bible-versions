Heman was a grandson of Samuel the prophet, and his role as a musician highlights the importance of music in worship. Asaph is often associated with the Psalms, as several are attributed to him, indicating his significant role in Israel's worship. Ethan, also known as Jeduthun, is mentioned in other parts of Scripture as a leader in music. These three musicians represent the organized and skilled approach to worship that David established, emphasizing the importance of music in the spiritual life of Israel. Their roles also prefigure the New Testament emphasis on worship in spirit and truth.<p><b>were to sound the bronze cymbals</b><br>Bronze cymbals were percussion instruments used in ancient Israelite worship, producing a loud and clear sound. The use of cymbals in worship was to create a joyful noise unto the Lord, as seen in <a href="/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>, which calls for various instruments to praise God. The choice of bronze, a durable and resonant metal, signifies the strength and clarity of worship that should be offered to God. This act of sounding cymbals can be seen as a type of the proclamation of the Gospel, where the message of Christ is to be declared loudly and clearly to all nations. The use of cymbals in worship also reflects the cultural practices of the time, where music played a central role in both religious and communal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heman.htm">Heman</a></b><br>A prominent musician and Levite, Heman was one of the leaders appointed by King David to oversee the music during the transportation of the Ark of the Covenant.

Verse 16 records, &#8220;David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers to raise their voices with joy, accompanied by musical instruments&#8212;harps, lyres, and cymbals.&#8221; Scripture consistently shows that music is not an optional flourish but a commanded element of Israel&#8217;s worship (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-31.htm">1 Chronicles 6:31&#8211;32</a>; 25:1; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12&#8211;13</a>). By calling them &#8220;musicians,&#8221; the text highlights a divinely assigned office&#8212;men set apart to lead the congregation in praise and to teach theology through song (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-21.htm">Deuteronomy 31:21</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Heman, Asaph, and Ethan</b><p>These three are repeatedly named as chief Levitical worship leaders.<p>&#8226; Heman: a grandson of Samuel, later called &#8220;the king&#8217;s seer in matters of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-5.htm">1 Chronicles 25:5</a>). <a href="/bsb/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a> bears his name.<p>&#8226; Asaph: author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73&#8211;83</a>, entrusted with sounding &#8220;the cymbals of bronze&#8221; when the ark was first placed in the tent (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Ethan (also called Jeduthun): linked to <a href="/bsb/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a> and to prophetic praise (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-3.htm">1 Chronicles 25:3</a>).<p>Grouping them together underscores unified leadership, much like the multiple elders who shepherd the New Testament church (<a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were to sound</b><p>&#8220;To sound&#8221; is more than making noise; it is purposeful proclamation.

Yet their connection in a series of four divisions of musical duty does throw some light upon them. These four verses manifestly purport to describe a special part to be performed by those of whom they respectively speak. Gesenius explains <span class="accented">psalteries on Alamoth</span> to mean such instruments as savoured of virgin tone or pitch, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> high as compared with the lower pitch of men's voices. This lower pitch he considers intimated by the word "Sheminith," literally, <span class="accented">the eighth</span>, or <span class="accented">octave</span>. The added expression, "to excel," need scarcely be, with him, understood to mean "to take the lead musically," but may be read generally to mark their supassing quality. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The musicians</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1443;&#1512;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ham&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;r&#601;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
