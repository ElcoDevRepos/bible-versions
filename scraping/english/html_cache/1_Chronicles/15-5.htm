They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects, including the Ark of the Covenant. This role highlights the importance of holiness and reverence in worship, as the Kohathites were tasked with transporting these sacred items without directly touching them, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>. Their duties underscore the theme of God's holiness and the need for purity in approaching Him.<p><b>Uriel the chief</b><br>Uriel is identified as the leader of the Kohathites in this context. The name Uriel means "God is my light," which reflects the biblical theme of God providing guidance and illumination to His people. As chief, Uriel would have had significant responsibilities in organizing and leading his family group in their sacred duties. This leadership role emphasizes the importance of godly leadership and the need for leaders to be guided by divine wisdom.<p><b>and 120 of his relatives</b><br>The mention of 120 relatives indicates the large number of Kohathites involved in the service of the tabernacle. This number reflects the communal and familial nature of Levitical service, where extended family units worked together in fulfilling their divine responsibilities. The number 120 is also significant in biblical numerology, often associated with a period of waiting or preparation, as seen in the 120 years before the flood (<a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>) and the 120 disciples gathered in the upper room before Pentecost (<a href="/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>).
