This Jeremiah is distinct from the more well-known prophet of the same name. The name "Jeremiah" means "Yahweh exalts," which reflects the theocentric nature of Hebrew names. The inclusion of Jeremiah in this list highlights the diverse backgrounds of those who supported David, emphasizing the unity and strength found in their shared purpose. This unity prefigures the gathering of believers in Christ, who come from various backgrounds to form one body (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-14</a>).<p><b>and Machbanai the eleventh</b><br>Machbanai, listed as the eleventh, is another warrior who joined David. His name means "bond of the Lord," suggesting a strong connection to God. The mention of Machbanai underscores the loyalty and dedication of David's followers, who were willing to risk their lives for the anointed king. This loyalty is reminiscent of the devotion expected of Christ's followers, who are called to take up their cross and follow Him (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>). The listing of these warriors in <a href="/1_chronicles/12.htm">1 Chronicles 12</a> serves as a testament to the fulfillment of God's promise to David, foreshadowing the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, the Son of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A warrior listed among the mighty men who joined David at Ziklag.
