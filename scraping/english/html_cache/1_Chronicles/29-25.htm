In the biblical context, Solomon's exaltation is a fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would succeed him and establish a lasting kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). This divine endorsement is crucial, as it legitimizes Solomon's rule and sets the stage for his renowned wisdom and wealth. The exaltation also prefigures the ultimate exaltation of Jesus Christ, who is often seen as a greater Solomon (<a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>).<p><b>in the sight of all Israel</b><br>This indicates that Solomon's elevation was public and recognized by the entire nation. The unity of Israel under Solomon's rule contrasts with the later division of the kingdom after his death. The public nature of his exaltation underscores the importance of communal acknowledgment and acceptance of God's chosen leader. It also reflects the biblical theme of God working through visible, historical events to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>and bestowed on him royal majesty</b><br>The royal majesty bestowed upon Solomon signifies the splendor and authority of his kingship. This majesty is not merely political but also spiritual, as it reflects God's glory and the ideal of a king who rules with wisdom and justice. Solomon's temple, wealth, and international fame are manifestations of this majesty. The concept of royal majesty also points to the Messianic expectation of a future king who would embody divine authority and bring peace and prosperity, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<p><b>such as had not been bestowed on any king in Israel before him</b><br>This phrase highlights the unprecedented nature of Solomon's reign. No previous king, including David, had experienced such a level of wealth, wisdom, and international influence. This sets Solomon apart as a unique figure in Israel's history, whose reign is often seen as the high point of the united monarchy. The comparison to previous kings underscores the fulfillment of God's promises and the potential for Israel to be a light to the nations. Solomon's unparalleled majesty foreshadows the ultimate reign of Christ, whose kingdom surpasses all earthly kingdoms in glory and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is actively involved in the establishment and exaltation of kings according to His divine plan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was chosen by God to succeed David as king of Israel.
