Their actions, particularly the humiliation of David's envoys, were seen as a grave insult, making them "a stench" to David. This phrase indicates a recognition of their offense and the resulting tension. The term "stench" suggests a severe breach in relations, echoing similar biblical expressions of disdain (e.g., <a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>). This realization marks a turning point, leading to military preparations.<p><b>Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver</b><br>Hanun, the Ammonite king, sought to bolster his defenses by hiring mercenaries. A thousand talents of silver was a substantial sum, indicating the seriousness of the threat they perceived from David. This financial investment underscores the wealth and resources available to the Ammonites, as well as the high stakes involved in their conflict with Israel. The use of silver as currency is consistent with ancient Near Eastern practices.<p><b>to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen</b><br>Chariots and horsemen were the elite military units of the time, symbolizing power and technological advancement in warfare. The decision to hire these forces reflects the Ammonites' strategic approach to countering Israel's military might. Chariots were particularly effective in open terrain, suggesting the Ammonites anticipated a large-scale battle. This move also highlights the reliance on foreign military aid, a common practice among smaller nations facing powerful adversaries.<p><b>from Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah</b><br>These regions were known for their skilled warriors and formidable chariotry. Aram-naharaim, often associated with Mesopotamia, was a significant power center. Aram-maacah and Zobah were smaller Aramean kingdoms, frequently mentioned in the context of regional conflicts. The alliances with these areas indicate a network of political and military relationships. This coalition against Israel reflects the broader geopolitical dynamics of the time, where smaller states often banded together against a common threat. The involvement of these regions also foreshadows future conflicts between Israel and the Arameans, as seen in later biblical narratives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A nation descended from Lot, often in conflict with Israel.

Instead of repentance, they brace for war&#8212;echoing <a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>, where concealing sin brings trouble.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word consistently warns that prideful offense against His covenant people invites judgment (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver</b><p>&#8226; A thousand talents&#8212;well over 30 tons&#8212;reveals desperation. Money is thrown at a problem that should have been solved by humility and apology.<p>&#8226; Similar patterns appear in kings who trusted wealth over God: Asa paid Ben-hadad with temple silver (2 Chron 16:2-3), and Ahaz drained the treasury to hire Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Reliance on riches instead of repentance violates <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, &#8220;Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The contrast is sharp: David, a man after God&#8217;s heart, depended on the LORD; Hanun depended on silver.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To hire for themselves chariots and horsemen</b><p>&#8226; Chariots represented cutting-edge military technology. The Ammonites seek numerical and tactical advantage rather than God&#8217;s favor.<p>&#8226; David had already captured and crippled chariots from Hadadezer (<a href="/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a>), proving that human hardware falls before divine power.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly discourages God&#8217;s people from multiplying horses (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>) because it tempts the heart to trust in might, not in the LORD (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The hireling army shows the futility of self-made security; <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a> reminds, &#8220;The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory is of the LORD.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah</b><p>&#8226; These northern Aramean kingdoms were skilled in chariot warfare (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6-8</a>). Hanun forges alliances with nations who neither know nor honor Israel&#8217;s God.<p>&#8226; Such alliances echo earlier failures: Jehoshaphat&#8217;s partnership with Ahab ended in disciplinary defeat (2 Chron 19:2). Isaiah later warned, &#8220;Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help&#8230; but do not look to the Holy One of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Instead of turning toward Jerusalem in contrition, the Ammonites turn outward to pagans, illustrating <a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>&#8217;s principle that friendship with the world makes one an enemy of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a> shows a proud nation doubling down on rebellion. Realizing they have offended David, the Ammonites choose money, military muscle, and pagan alliances over humble repentance. Scripture answers that impulse throughout history: trust in wealth, weapons, and worldly partners cannot protect against God&#8217;s righteous king. True safety lies in confession, humility, and alignment with the LORD, not in silver&#8208;bought chariots.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And when the children of Ammon.</span>--Up to this point the narrative has substantially coincided with 2 Samuel 10, and might have been derived immediately from it; but this and the following verses differ considerably from the older account, and add one or two material facts, which suggest another source.<p><span class= "bld">Made themselves odious.</span>--"Had become in bad odonr."

This detail is peculiar to the Chronicles.<p><span class= "bld">Out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.</span>--<span class= "ital">Out of Aram-nahara&#8249;m, and out of Aram-maachah,</span> &c Samuel has, "And they hired Aram-beth-rehob and Aram-zobah, 20,000 foot, and the king of Maachah, 1,000 men, and the men (or <span class= "ital">chieftain</span>) of Tob, 12,000men."Aram-nahara&#8249;m, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Aram of the two rivers, was the country between the Tigris and Euphrates (see <a href="/judges/3-8.htm" title="Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.">Judges 3:8</a>); Aram-beth-rehob may have been one of its political divisions, and is perhaps to be identified with Rehoboth-hannahar (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-48.htm" title="And when Samlah was dead, Shaul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.">1Chronicles 1:48</a>), on the Euphrates. Another Rehoboth ("Rehoboth-ir," <a href="/genesis/10-11.htm" title="Out of that land went forth Asshur, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,">Genesis 10:11</a>) lay on the Tigris, north-east of Nineveh, and was a suburb of that great city. Aram-maachah imply the dominions of "the king of Maachah," who is mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/19-7.htm" title="So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.">1Chronicles 19:7</a>; and Zobah, the Aram-zobah of Samuel. The chronicler makes no separate mention of the "men of T&#8226;b" (<a href="/judges/11-3.htm" title="Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and dwelled in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.">Judges 11:3</a>), perhaps because they were subject to Hadadezer, and as such, included in his forces. The Syriac and Arabic here have "from Aram-nahara&#8249;m, Haran, Nisibis, and Edom." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Made themselves odious</span>. The Hebrew root of very strong force, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, is here employed, and which our Authorized Version translates, both in the parallel place and elsewhere, far more uncompromisingly than here. <span class="cmt_word">A thousand talents</span>. Not stated in Samuel. This talent was of three thousand shekels, believed to be equivalent to f 342. Mesopotamia. The parallel place has Aram-beth-rehob, instead of our <span class="accented">Aram-naharaim</span> ("Syria of the Two Rivers," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Tigris and Euphrates; Authorized Version, "<span class="cmt_word">Mesopotamia"</span>). From comparing this verso with ver. 16, it may seem probable that those strictly called "<span class="accented">of Mesopotamia"</span> lent either no aid at first or but very partial. It is observable that the numbers of men supplied by Beth-rehob, Zobah, and Ishtob in the parallel place (viz. <span class="accented">thirty-two thousand</span>) agree with the numbers of this verse, from which we may conclude that, whatever Aram-beth-rehob (probably either Reho-both on the Euphrates, or Rehob last of Lebanon) and Aram-naharaim may <span class="accented">strictly</span> stand for respectively, they here substantially mean the same. It is possible that the difference is that of a corrupt text or careless copying. The Aram-naharaim (<span class="accented">Mesopotamia</span>), which comes before us first in <a href="/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>, passes out of Scripture language after the defeats of this chapter - the tract of country which it designated (some seven hundred miles by twenty to two hundred and fifty) being absorbed, first by Assyria, and afterwards by Babylon. The <span class="accented">Assyrian Inscriptions</span> reveal the fact that Mesopotamia was the prey of a largo number of small separate tribes at the period of the judges and the early Jewish monarchy, which is quite consistent with the glimpses we here get of it and its people<span class="cmt_word">. Aram-maachah</span> probably designates the tract of country north of East Manasseh, bordering on Palestine, and bounded by the Jordan, Mount Hermon, and on its east, Salcah. <span class="cmt_word">Zobah</span> (see <a href="/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a>, note; <a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>).
