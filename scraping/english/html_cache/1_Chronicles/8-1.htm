His lineage is crucial as it establishes the tribe of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The tribe of Benjamin played a vital role in Israel's history, providing the first king, Saul. Bela, as the firstborn, holds a position of prominence and leadership within the tribe. The name Bela means "destruction" or "devouring," which may reflect the tribe's later military prowess. This lineage is also mentioned in <a href="/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>, emphasizing the continuity of the tribal records.<p><b>Ashbel the second</b><br>Ashbel, the second son of Benjamin, is less prominent in biblical narratives but is still significant in maintaining the genealogical record of the tribe. His name means "a man of Baal" or "fire of God," which could indicate the religious influences or aspirations within the tribe. The mention of Ashbel in <a href="/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a> further solidifies his place in the tribal lineage, ensuring the preservation of his descendants' heritage.<p><b>Aharah the third</b><br>Aharah, the third son, is also known as Ahiram in some biblical passages, such as <a href="/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a>. The variation in names is not uncommon in ancient genealogies and may reflect different dialects or traditions. Aharah's inclusion in the genealogy underscores the importance of maintaining a complete record of Benjamin's descendants. His name, meaning "brother of evil" or "brother of the lofty," might suggest a complex character or a significant role within the tribe. The tribe of Benjamin, despite its small size, was known for its fierce warriors and strategic importance, as seen in <a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jacob and Rachel, Benjamin is one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

Scripture consistently presents these genealogies as real history, not legend.<p>&#8226; Bela&#8217;s place as firstborn is repeated in <a href="/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a> and in <a href="/1_chronicles/7-6.htm">1 Chronicles 7:6</a>, underscoring his importance in the tribe&#8217;s early growth.<p>&#8226; The clan that descends from Bela later produces warriors (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-7.htm">1 Chronicles 7:7</a>) and leaders in Saul&#8217;s day (<a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1-2</a>). His line reminds us that God can raise leaders from even the smallest tribe (<a href="/judges/20-15.htm">Judges 20:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul later identifies himself as &#8220;of the tribe of Benjamin&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>), showing that this line remained recognizable right into New Testament times.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ashbel the second</b><p>&#8220;Ashbel the second&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1</a>)<p>&#8226; Ashbel appears first in <a href="/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>, when Jacob brings his household into Egypt. Centuries later, Ashbel&#8217;s clan is counted in the wilderness census (<a href="/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a>), demonstrating God&#8217;s faithfulness to preserve every branch of the family tree.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;Ashbelites&#8221; are specifically named (<a href="/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a>), signaling that even a second-born son&#8217;s descendants could become a sizable, distinct sub-tribe.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1-4</a> Ashbel stands beside Bela and Aharah, showing that birth order never limits God&#8217;s use of a person or family line&#8212;each name matters.<p>&#8226; The chronicler&#8217;s careful listing assures readers returning from exile that the promises to all twelve tribes still stand (<a href="/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>; 4:1), including those tied to Ashbel&#8217;s descendants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Aharah the third</b><p>&#8220;Aharah the third&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1</a>)<p>&#8226; Aharah is called Ahiram in <a href="/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a>; Scripture&#8217;s minor spelling variations never undermine its accuracy but reflect common ancient naming practices.<p>&#8226; Like Bela and Ashbel, Aharah&#8217;s line survives slavery in Egypt, forty years in the wilderness, and the chaotic era of the judges&#8212;proof that God keeps covenant promises generation after generation (<a href="/exodus/1-1.htm">Exodus 1:1-7</a>; <a href="/judges/21-15.htm">Judges 21:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The chronicler places Aharah third, yet later verses give his descendants equal space (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-5.htm">1 Chronicles 8:5-7</a>). God values every branch, not just the most prominent.<p>&#8226; By tracing Saul&#8217;s lineage back through Aharah&#8217;s brother Bela (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>), the text indirectly honors Aharah as part of the same royal heritage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1</a> records three literal sons&#8212;Bela, Ashbel, and Aharah&#8212;rooting the Benjamite tribe in verifiable history.
