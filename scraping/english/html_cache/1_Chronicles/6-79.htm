It is mentioned in the context of the Levitical cities given to the Merarite clan. The name "Kedemoth" means "eastern parts" or "ancient places," which may indicate its geographical position or historical significance. In <a href="/deuteronomy/2-26.htm">Deuteronomy 2:26</a>, Moses sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon, king of Heshbon, seeking passage through his land. This highlights Kedemoth's strategic location as a point of contact and negotiation during Israel's wilderness journey. The city's inclusion in the Levitical allotment underscores the importance of providing for the spiritual leaders of Israel, ensuring they had places to live and resources to sustain their ministry.<p><b>and Mephaath</b><br>Mephaath was another city given to the tribe of Reuben and assigned to the Levites. It is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18 and 21</a>:37, indicating its role as a Levitical city. The name "Mephaath" is thought to mean "splendor" or "beauty," suggesting it may have been a place of some prominence or attractiveness. The city is also referenced in <a href="/jeremiah/48-21.htm">Jeremiah 48:21</a> as part of the Moabite territory, which reflects the shifting control and influence in the region over time. The allocation of Mephaath to the Levites highlights the broader biblical theme of God's provision for those dedicated to His service, ensuring they had a place within the community to carry out their priestly duties.<p><b>together with their pasturelands</b><br>The mention of pasturelands indicates the practical needs of the Levites, who required land not only for living but also for sustaining their livestock. This provision reflects the agrarian society of ancient Israel, where livestock played a crucial role in daily life and economy. The pasturelands were essential for the Levites' sustenance, as they did not have a tribal inheritance like the other tribes. This arrangement allowed them to focus on their spiritual responsibilities without the burden of agricultural labor. The concept of providing for the Levites is echoed in <a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2-3</a>, where God commands the Israelites to give cities and pasturelands to the Levites, ensuring their needs are met as they serve the community. This provision can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate provider and sustainer of His people, ensuring that those who serve Him are cared for.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kedemoth.htm">Kedemoth</a></b><br>A town allocated to the tribe of Reuben, located in the territory east of the Jordan River.

That earlier episode underlines the literal geography: the place truly existed, and its history is anchored in Israel&#8217;s wilderness journey.<p>&#8226; By dedicating Kedemoth to the Merarite Levites, God turned a site of past diplomacy into a center of worship and teaching. The Levites&#8217; presence reminded the surrounding clans that the Lord had the right to repurpose any piece of real estate for His service (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: God often reclaims spaces with complicated histories and assigns them to His servants for ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mephaath</b><p>&#8226; Listed immediately after Kedemoth in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">1 Chronicles 6:79</a>, Mephaath was likewise on the high plateau of Reubenite territory (<a href="/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Centuries later the town fell under Moabite control and came under prophetic judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/48-21.htm">Jeremiah 48:21</a>). That shift shows how literally the land changed hands when Israel drifted from obedience.<p>&#8226; Giving Mephaath to the Levites originally placed a teaching and worship center at Israel&#8217;s frontier, a living reminder that holy instruction belongs on the edges as well as the heartland (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: When God stations His people at cultural borders, He expects them to stand firm, regardless of political turnover around them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Together with their pasturelands</b><p>&#8226; The phrase repeats a covenant pattern first laid out in <a href="/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1&#8211;5</a>: every Levitical city had to be accompanied by &#8220;pasturelands&#8221; so the priests and their families could live and tend their flocks.<p>&#8226; These fields did not belong to the Levites outright (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1&#8211;2</a>); they were held in trust, underscoring that their true inheritance was the Lord Himself.<p>&#8226; The arrangement depended on the generosity and obedience of the other tribes, illustrating a divine principle later echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13&#8211;14</a> and <a href="/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>&#8212;those who minister spiritually should be cared for materially.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: Supporting those devoted to ministry is not optional; it is woven into God&#8217;s design for His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">1 Chronicles 6:79</a> records the Lord&#8217;s literal gift of Kedemoth and Mephaath&#8212;complete with surrounding fields&#8212;to the Merarite Levites. By doing so, God reclaimed real places with real histories, planted centers of worship on Israel&#8217;s frontier, and modeled the ongoing responsibility of His people to sustain those who serve Him. The verse may seem like a simple inventory, yet it quietly testifies to God&#8217;s ownership of land, His care for His ministers, and His call for every community&#8212;city and countryside alike&#8212;to be touched by faithful teaching and worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 79.</span> - The two names of this verso, with the two of the preceding, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the four names of the cities of Reuben, are absent from their proper place in the list in <a href="/joshua/21.htm">Joshua 21</a>. in the Hebrew Textus Receptus and the Vulgate, though found in <a href="/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a>. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Kedemoth,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6932.htm">Strong's 6932: </a> </span><span class="str2">Kedemoth -- a city in Reuben</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Mephaath,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;&#1508;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;p&#772;a&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4158.htm">Strong's 4158: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mephaath -- a Levitical city in Reuben</span><br /><br /><span class="word">together with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Direct object marker<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_853.htm">Strong's 853: </a> </span><span class="str2">Untranslatable mark of the accusative case</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their pasturelands.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7713;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#353;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4054.htm">Strong's 4054: </a> </span><span class="str2">A suburb, the area around a, building, the margin of the sea</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">1 Chronicles 6:79 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">1 Chronicles 6:79 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">1 Chronicles 6:79 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">1 Chronicles 6:79 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">1 Chronicles 6:79 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">1 Chronicles 6:79  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">1 Chronicles 6:79 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">1 Chronicles 6:79 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">1 Chronicles 6:79 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">1 Chronicles 6:79 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_chronicles/6-79.htm">OT History: 1 Chronicles 6:79 And Kedemoth with its suburbs and Mephaath (1 Chron. 1Ch iCh i Ch 1 chr 1chr)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/1_chronicles/6-78.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 6:78"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 6:78" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/1_chronicles/6-80.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 6:80"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 6:80" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
