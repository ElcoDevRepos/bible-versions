The Huppites and Shuppites were clans within the tribe of Benjamin, indicating inter-tribal marriages, which were common in Israel to strengthen alliances and maintain unity among the tribes. This marriage reflects the interconnectedness of the tribes of Israel and the importance of family lineage in maintaining tribal identity and inheritance rights.<p><b>The name of his sister was Maacah.</b><br>Maacah is a name that appears several times in the Old Testament, often associated with women of significance. The mention of Machir's sister by name suggests her importance in the genealogical record, possibly due to her marriage alliances or her role in the family. In ancient Israel, women were often identified in genealogies when they played a crucial role in the continuation of a family line or when they were connected to significant events or figures.<p><b>Another descendant was named Zelophehad, who had only daughters.</b><br>Zelophehad was a descendant of Manasseh, and his story is significant in the context of Israelite inheritance laws. His daughters&#8212;Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah&#8212;are noted for their appeal to Moses for the right to inherit their father's property, as he had no sons. This led to a change in the inheritance laws, allowing daughters to inherit if there were no sons, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/27.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>. This legal precedent highlights the evolving understanding of justice and equity in Israelite society and underscores the importance of preserving family inheritance within the tribe. The story of Zelophehad's daughters is also a testament to the active role women could play in shaping the legal and social structures of their time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/machir.htm">Machir</a></b><br>He is a descendant of Manasseh, one of the sons of Joseph.

This keeps covenant identity intact, echoing the call for Israel to remain distinct (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness to enlarge Manasseh just as Jacob prophesied in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>, showing lines multiplying through sanctioned marriages within the tribe.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The name of his sister was Maacah</b><p>&#8226; Chronicles rarely pauses to name sisters, so Maacah&#8217;s mention draws attention.

The verse quietly but powerfully affirms that every clan member&#8212;male or female&#8212;is part of the unfolding fulfillment of God&#8217;s promises to His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">And Machir took</span> to <span class= "bld">wife.</span>--The Hebrew cannot mean this.

(the name is omitted). It is tempting to make Zeiophehad the other wife, who had only daughters, whereas Maachah bore a son (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-16.htm" title="And Maachah the wife of Machir bore a son, and she called his name Peresh; and the name of his brother was Sheresh; and his sons were Ulam and Rakem.">1Chronicles 7:16</a>); but Numbers, <span class= "ital">l.c.,</span> and Josh., <span class= "ital">l.c.,</span> make Zelophehad a man. We must, therefore, suppose a <span class= "ital">lacuna</span> of some few words, which gave the name of Machir's second wife, and the descent of Zelophehad from her. The expression "of Huppim and of Shuppim" is literally "to Huppim and to Shuppim," that is, belonging to. So "of Tola," (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-2.htm" title="And the sons of Tola; Uzzi, and Rephaiah, and Jeriel, and Jahmai, and Jibsam, and Shemuel, heads of their father's house, to wit, of Tola: they were valiant men of might in their generations; whose number was in the days of David two and twenty thousand and six hundred.">1Chronicles 7:2</a>).<p>We have no means of further elucidating the import of this curious tribal record. That it relates to West Manasseh is inferred from its position here, as well from the fact that <a href="/context/1_chronicles/5-23.htm" title="And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelled in the land: they increased from Bashan to Baalhermon and Senir, and to mount Hermon.">1Chronicles 5:23-24</a> treated of East Manasseh.
