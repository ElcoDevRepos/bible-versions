His reign marked the division of the united kingdom into two: Israel in the north and Judah in the south. This division was a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Solomon due to his idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>). Rehoboam's harsh policies and refusal to listen to wise counsel led to the secession of the ten northern tribes (<a href="/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12:1-19</a>). This event is significant in biblical history as it set the stage for the separate histories of the northern and southern kingdoms.<p><b>Abijah was his son:</b><br>Abijah, also known as Abijam, reigned over Judah after Rehoboam. His reign was relatively short, lasting only three years (<a href="/1_kings/15.htm">1 Kings 15:1-8</a>). Despite his brief rule, Abijah is noted for his speech against Jeroboam, the king of Israel, emphasizing the Davidic covenant and the legitimacy of Judah's rule (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4-12</a>). His reign is characterized by a mixture of faithfulness to God and continuation of some of his father's policies.<p><b>Asa his son:</b><br>Asa was known for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry. He reigned for 41 years and is remembered for his commitment to the worship of Yahweh, removing idols and restoring the altar of the Lord (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2-5</a>). Asa's reign was marked by peace and prosperity, attributed to his faithfulness to God. However, in his later years, he relied on foreign alliances rather than God, which led to conflict (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-9</a>).<p><b>Jehoshaphat his son:</b><br>Jehoshaphat continued the religious reforms of his father Asa and strengthened the kingdom of Judah. He is noted for his efforts to educate the people in the Law of the Lord and for his judicial reforms (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-7.htm">2 Chronicles 17:7-9</a>). Jehoshaphat sought alliances with the northern kingdom, which were sometimes criticized, but he is generally remembered as a king who sought to follow God.
