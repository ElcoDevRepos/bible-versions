The "thirty" is a term used to describe an elite group, though the exact number may vary. These men were instrumental in establishing David's kingdom and are listed in detail in <a href="/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10-47</a>. Their exploits are celebrated in the context of David's rise to power, highlighting the importance of strong, loyal leadership in fulfilling God's purposes.<p><b>went down to David</b><br>This indicates a movement towards David, who was not yet king over all Israel but was recognized as a leader. The phrase "went down" suggests a descent, possibly from a higher elevation, and signifies a deliberate action to join David, acknowledging his God-given leadership. This act of allegiance is significant in the narrative of David's consolidation of power.<p><b>to the rock at the cave of Adullam</b><br>The cave of Adullam served as a refuge for David during his flight from King Saul, as recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22:1-2</a>. It became a gathering place for those who were in distress or discontented, forming the core of David's early support. The "rock" signifies a place of strength and protection, symbolizing God's provision and safety for David and his followers. This location is approximately 13 miles southwest of Jerusalem, in the Judean hills, providing a strategic hideout.<p><b>while a company of Philistines was encamped</b><br>The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during this period, often engaging in battles with Saul and later David. Their encampment indicates a military presence and a potential threat to David and his men. The Philistines' repeated incursions into Israelite territory underscore the ongoing conflict between the two peoples, which David would eventually subdue.<p><b>in the Valley of Rephaim</b><br>The Valley of Rephaim is located southwest of Jerusalem and was a frequent battleground between the Israelites and the Philistines. The name "Rephaim" is associated with ancient giants, adding a layer of historical and mythological significance. This valley's strategic importance is highlighted in several biblical accounts, including David's victories over the Philistines (<a href="/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18-25</a>). The location serves as a backdrop for God's deliverance and the establishment of David's rule, foreshadowing the ultimate victory of Christ over His enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who at this time was not yet reigning over all of Israel.

These were the elite among David&#8217;s &#8220;mighty men&#8221; (see <a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8&#8211;17</a>) who had distinguished themselves by extraordinary courage.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;thirty&#8221; is a formal title for the larger band of warriors (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-25.htm">1 Chronicles 11:25</a>), yet within that group three rose even higher. Their willingness to leave the safety of the camp shows a loyalty that mirrors Jonathan&#8217;s devotion to David in earlier days (<a href="/1_samuel/18-1.htm">1 Samuel 18:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; God often highlights small, committed groups&#8212;think of Gideon&#8217;s three hundred (<a href="/judges/7-6.htm">Judges 7:6-7</a>) or Jesus&#8217; inner circle of Peter, James, and John (<a href="/mark/5-37.htm">Mark 5:37</a>). Here, the three remind us that wholehearted devotion counts more than large numbers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Went down to David</b><p>&#8226; They &#8220;went down&#8221; intentionally, suggesting urgency and initiative. David had been anointed king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) yet was not on the throne; circumstances were against him, but these men aligned with God&#8217;s chosen leader rather than current power structures.<p>&#8226; Their action echoes Ruth leaving Moab to stand with Naomi and Israel&#8217;s God (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-17</a>); commitment to the Lord&#8217;s purposes often requires a decisive move.<p>&#8226; By seeking David, they also sought the Lord&#8217;s anointed, anticipating passages like <a href="/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>: &#8220;Kiss the Son&#8230; blessed are all who take refuge in Him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To the rock at the cave of Adullam</b><p>&#8226; Adullam had earlier sheltered David when he first fled Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1-2</a>).

Even in hiding, David and his men enjoyed God&#8217;s protection; the location foreshadows Christ as the Rock in whom believers hide (1 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 10</a>:4).<p>&#8226; The cave became a rallying point where discontented and distressed people gathered to David (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>).

The <span class="accented">thirty</span> here alluded to have not been mentioned either in the Book of Samuel or here, except by implication of our ver. 11, where we might imagine the sense to be, "Now these are the names of the mighty men, <span class="accented">in number thirty</span>, whom David had, viz. Jashobeam, an <span class="accented">Hachmonite</span>, <span class="accented">the chief of the thirty."</span> Nor are we told in either place who were the "three" here spoken cf. The article is absent in both places, or it would be convenient and natural to suppose that the three just mentioned are those intended, which cannot, however, be taken for granted. The language of vers. 20-22, 25, might rather indicate that the three mentioned in those verses are those in question. The repeated uncertainty in which we are left on matters to which no intrinsic difficulty adheres seems evidence of injured manuscripts rather than of anything else. <span class="cmt_word">To the rock to David</span>. This is the right reading, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;</span>; and that in the parallel passage ("to <span class="accented">David in the harvest-time"</span>) is not correct, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The cave of Adullam</span>. Adullam, evidently a place of great antiquity (<a href="/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>:l, 12, 20), is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>; it was the seat then of a Canaanite king. It afterwards lay in Judah, in that lowland (called often the Shephelah) that ran from Joppa to Gaza, near the Mediterranean Sea. It kept name and fame to the last (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>). The "rock" marks the limestone cliffs of the region (Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 254-259, edit. 1866). We read of it, as David's refuge (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1, 2</a>). From our present passage, and its parallel we should have concluded that it could not have been far from Bethlehem. In this sense Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' pp. 606, 607) refers to the tradition that fixes the cave at a spot now called <span class="accented">Khureitun</span>, between Bethlehem and the Dead Sea, and says, "Leaving our horses in charge of wild Arabs, and taking one Arab for a guide, we started for the cave, having a fearful gorge below, gigantic cliffs above, and the path winding along a shelf of the rock, narrow enough to make the nervous among us shudder. At length from a great rock, hanging on the edge of this shelf, we sprang by a long leap into a low window, which opened into the perpendicular face of the cliff. We were then within the hold of David, and creeping half-doubled through a narrow crevice for a few rods, we stood beneath the dark vault of the first grand chamber of this mysterious and oppressive cavern. Our whole collection of lights did little more than make the damp darkness visible. After groping about as long as we had Lime to spare, we returned to the light of day, fully convinced that, with David and his lion-hearted followers inside, all the strength of Israel under Saul could not have forced an entrance, and would not even have attempted it." <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">host</span>. For this word "host" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>) the parallel (<a href="/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13</a>) has the "life of the Philistines" (but the Authorized Version, the "troop of"), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the beasts and cattle of the Philistines. So also the Syriac Version translates, The Septuagint shows in this place <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, and in Samuel <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">valley of Rephaim</span>. The situation of this notable valley is not certain. Yet there can be little doubt, in spite of Furst ('Handwortbuch,' 2:383), who supposes a situation north-west of Jerusalem, that it must be near Bethlehem, and therefore south-west of the city. The word employed Here for "valley" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> should mark an <span class="accented">enclosed</span> one. <span class="accented">Rephaim</span> means "giants." Hence our Authorized Version, "The valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward" (<a href="/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>;
