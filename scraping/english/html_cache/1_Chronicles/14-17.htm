His fame spreading "into every land" signifies the extent of his influence beyond the borders of Israel, reaching neighboring nations. This phrase highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to make David's name great (<a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>). The historical context shows that David's leadership and military prowess were recognized widely, contributing to the stability and expansion of Israel. Archaeological findings, such as the Tel Dan Stele, provide evidence of David's historical existence and his impact on the region.<p><b>and the LORD caused all nations to fear him</b><br>The fear of David among the nations was not merely due to his military might but was divinely orchestrated. This fear can be seen as a fulfillment of God's covenant with Israel, where He promised to protect and establish them as a powerful nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-10.htm">Deuteronomy 28:10</a>). The phrase underscores the theological theme that God is sovereign over the affairs of nations, using David as His instrument. This divine intervention is reminiscent of the fear that fell upon the nations during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>). In a typological sense, David's role as a king who brings peace and security foreshadows the ultimate reign of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, whose kingdom will be established in righteousness and feared by all nations (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, David is the King of Israel, known for his military prowess, leadership, and heart for God.

Word of those triumphs spread far beyond Israel&#8217;s borders.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows God promising to magnify David&#8217;s name: &#8220;I will make for you a name like the names of the greatest men on earth&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>). Here that promise is coming to pass in real time.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s renown was rooted in God&#8217;s works, not self-promotion. Earlier we read, &#8220;David continued to succeed in all his ways, for the LORD was with him&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-14.htm">1 Samuel 18:14</a>). Every report about his victories pointed listeners to the God who empowered him.<p>&#8226; By elevating David&#8217;s reputation, the Lord was also elevating His own&#8212;much as He later did through Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/4-34.htm">1 Kings 4:34</a>) and through the early church (<a href="/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: When God&#8217;s people walk in obedience, He is able to use their faithfulness to broadcast His glory well beyond their immediate circle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the LORD caused all nations to fear him</b><p>&#8226; The verse puts the spotlight squarely on God&#8217;s initiative: &#8220;the LORD caused.&#8221; David&#8217;s military skill was real, yet the text credits divine intervention for the awe that fell on surrounding peoples.<p>&#8226; This continues a pattern stretching back to the Exodus: &#8220;This very day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples under heaven&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>). Centuries later, Jehoshaphat experienced the same phenomenon (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-10.htm">2 Chronicles 17:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;fear&#8221; here is not merely panic but a sober recognition that Israel&#8217;s God defends His anointed king. <a href="/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43</a> captures the thought: &#8220;You have made me the head of nations; a people I had not known shall serve me&#8221;.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s purpose was covenantal. By protecting David, He safeguarded the royal line that would lead to Messiah (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>). The respect&#8212;or dread&#8212;of the nations created breathing room for Israel to worship freely and for David to prepare for the building of the temple (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-17.htm">1 Chronicles 22:17-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: When the Lord establishes His authority through His people, even opponents must acknowledge His power (<a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>). Our role is to remain surrendered; His role is to bring the results.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/14-17.htm">1 Chronicles 14:17</a> records more than a military footnote; it showcases God fulfilling His promise to exalt David and protect Israel. David&#8217;s expanding fame testified to the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness, while the fear falling on the nations protected God&#8217;s people and advanced His redemptive plan. The verse invites us to trust the same God who still magnifies His name through obedient servants and faithfully shields them for His purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">This verse is not in Samuel.</span> It looks like a concluding reflection of the chronicler's, similar to <a href="/2_chronicles/17-10.htm" title="And the fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.">2Chronicles 17:10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-29.htm" title="And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.">2Chronicles 20:29</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The fame of David went out.</span>--<span class= "ital">David's name.</span> The same phrase recurs in <a href="/2_chronicles/26-15.htm" title="And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and on the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones with.

In the view of the chronicler, David's success in arms, with all its consequences, was the work of Jehovah. The Hebrew phrase is similar to that in <a href="/esther/8-17.htm" title="And in every province, and in every city, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day.
