The Edomite kings ruled before any king reigned over the Israelites, as noted in <a href="/genesis/36-31.htm">Genesis 36:31</a>. This phrase marks the transition of power, a common occurrence in monarchies, and highlights the mortality of human leaders, contrasting with the eternal reign of God. The death of a king often led to political changes and could affect the stability of the region.<p><b>Shaul from Rehoboth on the Euphrates</b><br>Shaul's origin, Rehoboth on the Euphrates, suggests a connection to a significant geographical location. The Euphrates River was a major waterway in the ancient Near East, often associated with prosperity and trade. Rehoboth, meaning "broad places," indicates a place of expansion or growth. This location may have been a strategic or economically important area, influencing Shaul's rise to power. The mention of the Euphrates also connects to the broader biblical narrative, as the river is one of the boundaries of the land promised to Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>).<p><b>reigned in his place</b><br>The succession of Shaul as king signifies the continuation of Edomite leadership and the dynastic nature of their rule. This transition reflects the political structures of the time, where kingship was often hereditary or passed to a chosen successor. The phrase underscores the temporal nature of earthly kingdoms, which rise and fall, in contrast to the eternal kingdom of God. The concept of reigning also points to the ultimate reign of Christ, who is prophesied to rule with justice and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samlah.htm">Samlah</a></b><br>A king mentioned in the genealogies of Edom, who reigned before Shaul.

Samlah&#8217;s death, recorded also in <a href="/genesis/36-37.htm">Genesis 36:37</a>, underlines the precision and reliability of Scripture&#8217;s genealogies.<p>&#8226; This simple clause illustrates the rhythm of history: leaders rise and fall, yet the Lord&#8217;s purposes stand (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>). We see the same pattern in <a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a> and <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>, where a generation&#8217;s passing makes room for the next, accenting human mortality and divine continuity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shaul</b><p>&#8226; Shaul (&#8220;Saul&#8221; in many English texts) is not Israel&#8217;s first king but an Edomite ruler. His inclusion shows God&#8217;s concern to chronicle even nations outside the covenant line. <a href="/genesis/36-38.htm">Genesis 36:38</a> lists him immediately after Samlah, proving the Chronicler&#8217;s accuracy.<p>&#8226; The repetition of the name Saul across different eras (<a href="/1_samuel/9-2.htm">1 Samuel 9:2</a>; <a href="/acts/13-21.htm">Acts 13:21</a>) displays the shared humanity of all peoples and reminds us that God tracks every life, not only Israel&#8217;s.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from Rehoboth on the Euphrates</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Rehoboth on the Euphrates&#8221; (lit. &#8220;Rehoboth by the River,&#8221; <a href="/genesis/36-37.htm">Genesis 36:37</a>) places Shaul&#8217;s origin near the great waterway that bounded much of the ancient Near East (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail highlights Edom&#8217;s wider connections&#8212;commerce, travel, and cultural exchange along the Euphrates corridor (<a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>). Such precision anchors the verse in verifiable geography, underscoring Scripture&#8217;s literal trustworthiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>reigned in his place</b><p>&#8226; Succession occurs without fanfare because God &#8220;removes kings and establishes them&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).

Shaul&#8217;s reign is one link in that prophetic chain.<p>&#8226; The verse also teaches the value of orderly transition, contrasting with periods of chaos (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). Stability, even in a non-covenant nation, reflects God&#8217;s common grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/1-48.htm">1 Chronicles 1:48</a> documents the orderly handoff of Edomite power from Samlah to Shaul, pinpointing Shaul&#8217;s roots in Rehoboth on the Euphrates.
