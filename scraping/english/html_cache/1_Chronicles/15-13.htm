Their absence in the initial attempt to move the Ark (1 Chronicles 13) was a significant oversight. This highlights the importance of following God's specific instructions, as the Levites were set apart for holy service (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>). The failure to include them reflects a neglect of divine order and a misunderstanding of the sacredness of their role.<p><b>that the LORD our God burst forth in anger against us.</b><br>The phrase "burst forth in anger" recalls the incident with Uzzah, who was struck down for touching the Ark (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-10.htm">1 Chronicles 13:10</a>). This demonstrates God's holiness and the seriousness of approaching Him with reverence and obedience. The Ark represented God's presence, and mishandling it was a direct violation of His commands. This event serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the need for proper worship.<p><b>For we did not consult Him about the proper order.&#8221;</b><br>David acknowledges the failure to seek God's guidance in the process of moving the Ark. This reflects a broader biblical principle of seeking God's will in all matters (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>). The "proper order" refers to the specific instructions given in the Law regarding the transport of the Ark (<a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14-15</a>). This oversight emphasizes the importance of adhering to God's Word and the necessity of consulting Him in all decisions, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who sought to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.

Even the Kohathites themselves were forbidden to "touch any holy thing," as Uzza had ventured to do. It has been said that the "sanctity of institutions," as opposed to the "sanctity of a people under the government of a righteous God," is the leading idea of the Chronicles. It would be difficult to show how the sanctity of a people is to be secured, and how the government of a righteous God is to be realised, except in and through Divine institutions. As there is a "due order" by which God rules the physical world, so is there a corresponding order whereby His will is fulfilled in the spiritual sphere. There are positive institutions in Christianity as well as in Mosaism; and if we abolish the Divine authority of the one, why not of the other also? . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - This verse purports to say that the Levites had been deficient in their duty in the double sense of not having themselves exclusively undertaken the removal of the ark, and not having executed that removal after the due order. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/15-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">It was because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you Levites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were not with us</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the first time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;mab&#183;b&#257;&#183;ri&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
