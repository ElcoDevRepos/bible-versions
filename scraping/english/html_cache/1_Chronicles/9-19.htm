Korah led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron (Numbers 16), which resulted in his death. Despite this, his descendants were later given roles of responsibility in the temple service, indicating God's grace and redemption. The lineage through Kore and Ebiasaph highlights the continuity of the Levitical duties passed down through generations. This lineage is also mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-22.htm">1 Chronicles 6:22-23</a>, emphasizing the importance of family heritage in temple service.<p><b>and his relatives from the Korahites</b><br>The Korahites were a subgroup of the Levites, specifically tasked with roles related to the tabernacle and later the temple. They were known for their musical contributions, as seen in the Psalms attributed to the sons of Korah (e.g., Psalms 42, 44-49). Their role in guarding the temple signifies a trusted position, reflecting their restored status and dedication to worship and service.<p><b>were assigned to guard the thresholds of the Tent</b><br>Guarding the thresholds of the Tent of Meeting was a critical duty, ensuring the sanctity and security of the sacred space. This role required vigilance and a deep sense of responsibility, as the Tent was where God's presence dwelled among His people. The assignment of this task to the Korahites underscores their reliability and the trust placed in them by the community.<p><b>just as their fathers had been assigned to guard the entrance to the dwelling of the LORD</b><br>This phrase connects the current duties of the Korahites to their ancestral responsibilities, highlighting the continuity of service across generations. The "dwelling of the LORD" refers to the tabernacle, and later the temple, as the central place of worship and divine presence. This continuity reflects the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel and the importance of maintaining the sacred traditions and roles established by God. The reference to their fathers' assignments also serves as a reminder of the faithfulness required in serving God, a theme echoed throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shallum.htm">Shallum</a></b><br>A leader among the gatekeepers, specifically from the family of Korah.

Jude 3).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/9-19.htm">1 Chronicles 9:19</a> portrays Shallum and his Korahite relatives faithfully guarding the Tent&#8217;s entrances, a duty inherited from their fathers. Their lineage shows God&#8217;s redemptive mercy after Korah&#8217;s rebellion, while their role emphasizes the need to protect the holiness of God&#8217;s dwelling. Their vigilant service prefigures Christ the Gate and encourages every generation to preserve worship, purity, and truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Koran.</span>--Comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/26-1.htm" title="Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.">1Chronicles 26:1</a>, which makes "Meshelemiah son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph" a guild of warders under David.<p><span class= "bld">Ebiasaph</span>--"The Father (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> God) gathered," is a fuller form of <span class= "ital">Asaph,</span> "He gathered."<p><span class= "bld">And his brethren, of the house of his father.</span>--That is, the Korahites, as is immediately explained: <span class= "ital">his kinsmen belonging to his father-house</span> or <span class= "ital">clan.</span><p><span class= "bld">The work of</span> <span class= "bld">the service</span> (of Shallum),--That is, of the guild so called, is defined as that of "wardens of the thresholds of the tent," that is, of the Temple, which had taken the place of the old Tent of Meeting.<p><span class= "bld">And</span> <span class= "bld">their fathers, being over the host of the Lord, were keepers of the entry.</span>--"Their fathers" are the ancestors of the Korahite clan of Shallura.<p><span class= "bld">The host of the Lord.</span>--Or, rather, <span class= "ital">the encampment of Jehovah,</span> means the tabernacle, or Tent of Tryst, which had only one entrance, over which, according to this passage--the Pentateuch is silent--the house of Shallum stood guard. <a href="/2_chronicles/31-2.htm" title="And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.">2Chronicles 31:2</a> applies the same archaic nomenclature to the Temple in Hezekiah's reign, speaking of "the gates of the camps of Iahweh."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shallum</span>.
