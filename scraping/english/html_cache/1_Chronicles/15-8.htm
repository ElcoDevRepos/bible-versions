Elizaphan was a son of Uzziel, who was a son of Kohath, one of the three sons of Levi. The Kohathites had specific duties related to the tabernacle, including the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects. This lineage highlights the importance of the Levitical priesthood and their role in worship and service to God. The mention of the Elizaphanites underscores the organized structure of the Levites and their designated responsibilities in the religious life of Israel.<p><b>Shemaiah the chief</b><br>Shemaiah, as the chief, indicates a position of leadership and authority among the Elizaphanites. Leadership roles among the Levites were crucial for maintaining order and ensuring the proper execution of religious duties. The name Shemaiah means "heard by Yahweh," which reflects a common theme in biblical names where the character's name signifies their relationship with God. This leadership role is significant in the context of <a href="/1_chronicles/15.htm">1 Chronicles 15</a>, where David is organizing the Levites for the transportation of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, emphasizing the importance of proper leadership in worship.<p><b>and 200 of his relatives</b><br>The mention of 200 relatives signifies the large number of Levites involved in the religious activities surrounding the Ark. This reflects the communal and familial nature of Levitical service, where entire families were dedicated to the service of God. The large number also indicates the importance of the event, as moving the Ark was a significant religious and national undertaking. This gathering of relatives for a common purpose can be seen as a type of the unity and collective worship that is fulfilled in the New Testament church, where believers are called to serve together as one body in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elizaphan.htm">Elizaphan</a></b><br>A descendant of Kohath, one of the sons of Levi.

These men were set apart for temple service long before David&#8217;s time (<a href="/numbers/3-30.htm">Numbers 3:30</a>; <a href="/exodus/6-22.htm">Exodus 6:22</a>).<p>- By naming this clan first, the writer underscores how every Levitical family had a place in bringing the ark to Jerusalem (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>). No tribe or clan was overlooked.<p>- Their presence fulfills earlier commands that only Levites should bear the holy things (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>), highlighting David&#8217;s renewed obedience after the failed attempt in <a href="/bsb/1_chronicles/13.htm">1 Chronicles 13</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shemaiah the chief</b><p>- &#8220;Shemaiah the chief&#8221; identifies the leading representative of the Elizaphanites.

This brief verse reminds us that God calls specific families, raises faithful leaders, and gathers willing numbers to accomplish holy tasks.
