The genealogies in 1 Chronicles serve to establish the historical and covenantal continuity of God's people. Segub's son, Jair, is more prominently noted in the biblical text. Jair is associated with the tribe of Manasseh, which settled on the east side of the Jordan River. This connection emphasizes the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land and the multiplication of his descendants.<p><b>who had twenty-three cities</b><br>Jair's possession of twenty-three cities indicates significant influence and authority. In the ancient Near East, city ownership was a sign of power and wealth. This detail underscores the prosperity and expansion of the Israelite tribes during the period of the Judges. Jair's leadership and control over these cities suggest a period of stability and governance, which was crucial for the development of the Israelite nation. The number of cities also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites a land flowing with milk and honey, as they were able to establish and maintain settlements.<p><b>in the land of Gilead</b><br>Gilead is a region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and fertile land. It was a significant area for the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. The mention of Gilead connects Jair to the Transjordan tribes, highlighting the geographical expansion of Israel's territory. Gilead's strategic location made it a vital area for trade and military defense. The region's mention in various biblical narratives, including the stories of Jephthah and Elijah, underscores its importance in Israel's history. Gilead's role in the biblical narrative also points to God's faithfulness in providing for His people and establishing them in the land He promised.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/segub.htm">Segub</a></b><br>A descendant of Judah, Segub is mentioned as the father of Jair.

In God&#8217;s precise record-keeping, every name matters.
