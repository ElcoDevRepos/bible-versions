This reflects the importance of leadership and trust within military ranks. Abishai, a seasoned warrior, is frequently mentioned in the context of David's mighty men (<a href="/2_samuel/23-18.htm">2 Samuel 23:18</a>). The delegation of troops to Abishai underscores the necessity of wise leadership and the distribution of responsibilities in achieving victory. This act of entrusting Abishai with command also highlights the familial bonds and loyalty that were crucial in David's military campaigns.<p><b>who arrayed them against the Ammonites</b><br>The Ammonites were a neighboring nation often in conflict with Israel. This phrase indicates the preparation and organization of troops for battle, emphasizing the strategic planning involved in warfare. The Ammonites, descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>), had a history of enmity with Israel, often engaging in battles over territory and power. The arraying of troops signifies readiness and the importance of order in military engagements. This preparation can be seen as a reflection of spiritual readiness and the need for believers to be prepared for spiritual battles, as echoed in <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>, where Paul speaks of putting on the full armor of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, known for his military prowess and strategic mind.
