His counsel was considered as if one inquired of the word of God. However, his story ends in betrayal and tragedy, as he sided with Absalom during the rebellion against David. His successor, Jehoiada, son of Benaiah, indicates a transition in leadership. Benaiah was a valiant warrior and leader of David's bodyguard, suggesting that Jehoiada came from a lineage of loyalty and strength. This transition marks a shift from the wisdom of Ahithophel to the military prowess and loyalty represented by Jehoiada.<p><b>then by Abiathar</b><br>Abiathar was a priest who remained loyal to David during Absalom's rebellion. He was one of the two priests who supported David, the other being Zadok. Abiathar's inclusion here signifies the importance of priestly counsel in the administration of the kingdom. However, his later support for Adonijah over Solomon led to his removal from the priesthood, fulfilling the prophecy against the house of Eli. This highlights the theme of divine justice and the fulfillment of God's word.<p><b>Joab was the commander of the king&#8217;s army</b><br>Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was a key military leader under King David. Known for his military acumen and sometimes ruthless tactics, Joab played a crucial role in securing David's kingdom. His position as commander underscores the importance of military leadership in maintaining the stability and security of the nation. Joab's complex character is marked by loyalty to David, yet he often acted independently, leading to tension and eventual downfall. His story serves as a reminder of the balance between loyalty and obedience to God's anointed king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahithophel.htm">Ahithophel</a></b><br>A counselor to King David, known for his wisdom.

God&#8217;s kingdom advances, but the unfaithful are set aside (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehoiada, &#8220;son of Benaiah,&#8221; steps into a vacated post of royal counselor. Earlier, Benaiah son of Jehoiada was David&#8217;s trusted commander of the Cherethites and Pelethites (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>); here the names are reversed, indicating a new generation rising.<p>&#8226; Lesson: God provides fresh, faithful leadership after failure in the previous generation.
