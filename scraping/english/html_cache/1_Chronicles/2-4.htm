After Er's death, she was given to his brother Onan, who also died. Judah initially withheld his youngest son, Shelah, from her, leading Tamar to take matters into her own hands to secure her place in the family lineage. This story is found in <a href="/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>, highlighting themes of justice and the fulfillment of familial duty. Tamar's actions, though unconventional, are seen as a means to ensure the continuation of Judah's line, which is significant in the genealogy of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>).<p><b>bore to him Perez and Zerah</b><br>Perez and Zerah were twins born to Tamar and Judah. The birth of Perez is particularly significant as he becomes an ancestor of King David and, ultimately, Jesus Christ. The story of their birth is marked by a struggle, as Zerah initially appeared to be the firstborn, but Perez emerged first, symbolizing a breakthrough or breach. This event is a foreshadowing of the unexpected ways God often works through human history, choosing the younger or less likely to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the lives of Jacob and Esau, and later, David himself.<p><b>Judah had five sons in all</b><br>Judah's five sons include Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. The mention of five sons underscores the importance of lineage and inheritance in ancient Israelite culture. Judah's line is crucial in biblical history, as it leads to the Davidic dynasty and the Messianic prophecy. The number five can also symbolize God's grace, as seen in various biblical contexts. Judah's family story, with its complexities and moral challenges, illustrates God's sovereignty and grace in using flawed individuals to accomplish His divine plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a></b><br>A Canaanite woman who became the daughter-in-law of Judah.
