This system ensured that the kingdom was always protected without overburdening any single group. The number eight in biblical numerology often signifies new beginnings or a new order, which may symbolize the renewal of military strength each month.<p><b>was Sibbecai the Hushathite</b><br>Sibbecai is noted as one of David's mighty warriors, also mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/21-18.htm">2 Samuel 21:18</a>, where he defeated a Philistine giant. His designation as a Hushathite indicates his origin from Hushah, a location not precisely identified but likely within the tribal territories of Judah. This highlights the diverse backgrounds of David's warriors, unified under his leadership.<p><b>a Zerahite</b><br>The term Zerahite refers to Sibbecai's descent from Zerah, one of the sons of Judah and Tamar (<a href="/genesis/38-30.htm">Genesis 38:30</a>). This lineage places him within the tribe of Judah, the same tribe as King David, emphasizing the strong tribal connections and loyalties that were significant in Israel's social and military structures.<p><b>There were 24,000 men in his division</b><br>Each division of David's army consisted of 24,000 men, a substantial force that reflects the organized and formidable nature of Israel's military under David's reign. This number also suggests a well-structured system capable of rapid mobilization, ensuring the kingdom's security. The organization into divisions parallels the order seen in other parts of David's administration, such as the priestly courses (1 Chronicles 24), indicating a comprehensive approach to governance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sibbecai_the_hushathite.htm">Sibbecai the Hushathite</a></b><br>Sibbecai was one of David's mighty warriors, known for his bravery and leadership. He is mentioned as the leader of the division for the eighth month, commanding 24,000 men. His designation as a "Hushathite" indicates his origin from Hushah, a place or clan within the tribe of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zerahite.htm">Zerahite</a></b><br>This term refers to Sibbecai's lineage, tracing back to Zerah, one of the sons of Judah. The Zerahites were a prominent family within the tribe of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eighth_month.htm">The Eighth Month</a></b><br>In the Hebrew calendar, the eighth month is known as Cheshvan.

The orderly sequence echoes the principle that &#8220;everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p>&#8226; Eight often signals fresh commitment after the completion of a cycle, as seen when newborn boys were circumcised on the eighth day (<a href="/genesis/17-12.htm">Genesis 17:12</a>), underscoring renewal in service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the eighth month</b><p>&#8226; Each commander handled one specific month, avoiding burnout and ensuring constant readiness (compare <a href="/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>, where Solomon appointed officers by month to supply the palace).<p>&#8226; The practice reflects wise stewardship: no month&#8212;and, by extension, no season of life&#8212;is left uncovered (<a href="/proverbs/24-27.htm">Proverbs 24:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was Sibbecai the Hushathite</b><p>&#8226;

&#8220;Hushathite&#8221; links him to the clan of Hushah in Judah (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>), showing how God raises leaders from local roots for national impact.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a Zerahite</b><p>&#8226;

it reflected covenant family lines (<a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; This detail highlights that faithful service runs in families when they stay committed to God&#8217;s promises (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There were 24,000 men in his division</b><p>&#8226;
