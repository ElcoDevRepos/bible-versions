Asher's territory was located in the northern part of the land of Canaan, along the Mediterranean coast. This tribe was known for its rich and fertile land, which was ideal for agriculture and olive production. In biblical prophecy, Asher is often associated with abundance and prosperity, as seen in Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>, where Asher's food is described as rich and fit for a king.<p><b>they were given Mashal</b><br>Mashal is one of the towns allocated to the Levites from the tribe of Asher. The Levites were the priestly tribe, set apart for religious duties and service in the Tabernacle and later the Temple. The allocation of cities to the Levites, including Mashal, fulfilled God's command to provide for the Levites since they did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes (<a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>). The exact location of Mashal is uncertain today, but it was likely situated within the fertile region of Asher, providing the Levites with resources to sustain their ministry.<p><b>Abdon</b><br>Abdon is another town given to the Levites from the tribe of Asher. Like Mashal, it served as a Levitical city, providing a place for the Levites to live and perform their duties. The name Abdon means "servile" or "service," which is fitting given the Levites' role in serving the spiritual needs of Israel. The location of Abdon is also not precisely known, but it was part of the network of Levitical cities that ensured the presence of religious leaders throughout the land. This distribution of cities helped maintain the spiritual health of the nation and facilitated the teaching of God's law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_asher.htm">Tribe of Asher</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Asher, the eighth son of Jacob and Zilpah.
