This moment follows David's military victories and the unification of the tribes under his rule. The palace, built of cedar, a valuable and durable wood, reflects David's established kingship and God's blessing upon him. This setting marks a transition from David as a warrior to a ruler focused on governance and spiritual matters.<p><b>he said to Nathan the prophet</b><br>Nathan, a trusted prophet and advisor to David, plays a crucial role in communicating God's will. Prophets in Israel served as intermediaries between God and the people, often providing guidance and correction. Nathan's presence indicates the importance of seeking divine counsel in leadership decisions. This relationship between David and Nathan exemplifies the biblical principle of leaders surrounding themselves with godly counsel.<p><b>&#8220;Here I am, living in a house of cedar</b><br>David's reflection on his own dwelling highlights the contrast between his royal residence and the temporary dwelling of the ark. Cedar wood, imported from Lebanon, was a luxury and symbolized wealth and permanence. David's statement reveals his awareness of the disparity and his desire to honor God appropriately. This moment foreshadows David's intention to build a temple, a task ultimately fulfilled by his son Solomon.<p><b>while the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent.&#8221;</b><br>The ark, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel, was housed in the tabernacle, a portable tent used since the time of Moses. This arrangement, suitable for Israel's nomadic past, now seemed inadequate to David in light of his own circumstances. The ark's location under a tent underscores the temporary and humble nature of its dwelling compared to David's palace. This concern for the ark's housing reflects David's heart for worship and his desire to glorify God. The ark's presence in Jerusalem also signifies the centrality of worship in the life of Israel and foreshadows the establishment of the temple as a permanent place of worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his heart for God and his desire to honor Him.

David's thoughts respecting the honour due to God and to the ark of the covenant had time to grow into convictions, and they were greatly and rightly stimulated by reflection on his own surroundings of comfort, of safety, of stability and splendour. He revolves the possible methods and the right methods of showing that honour due. The completion of his own house, one presumably fit for the permanent abode of the King of Israel (<a href="/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a>), is the clear demonstration to him that the ark should not dwell in a mere tent. It is a true touch of life, when it is written that as <span class="cmt_word">David sat in his house</span> these thoughts possessed him, and so strongly. The exact time, however, here designed, and the exact occasion of his revealing the thoughts that burned within him, to Nathan, do not appear either here or in the parallel place. In the opinion of some, an indication of some interval having elapsed is found in the words (<a href="/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1</a>), "The Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies;" while others consider those words to refer to the victories gained over the Philistines, as recorded in ch. 14. <span class="cmt_word">Nathan the prophet</span>. This name suddenly breaks upon us, without any introduction, here for the first time. Nathan is emphatically entitled "the prophet," but perhaps merely to distinguish him from Nathan, David's eighth son. Amid many other important references to Nathan, and which speak for themselves, must be specially noted <a href="/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>. And it will be noticed from the former of these references, in particular how Nathan is the prophet (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>); not (like Samuel and Gad) seer (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>). Possibly he is intended in <a href="/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a><span class="cmt_word">. An house of cedars</span>. The cedar here spoken of does, of course, not answer to our red, odorous cedar. The word employed is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;</span>, in the plural number. The first Biblical use of this word is found in <a href="/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4, 6, 49-52</a>. It is derived by Gesenius from an obsolete word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;</span>, from the grip and the firmness of its roots. It is probably the <span class="accented">derived</span> signification, therefore, that should be adhered to (as in the Authorized Version), and not the original, where in <a href="/ezekiel/27-24.htm">Ezekiel 27:24</a>, the plural of the passive participial is found, "made of cedar," not with A. Schultens, "<span class="accented">made</span> <span class="accented">fast."</span> The cedar genus belonging to the order Coniferae, is odoriferous, very lasting, and without knots. The numerous good qualities which it possesses are spoken to in the variety of uses, and good kind of uses, to which it was put - these all crowned by the almost solitary spiritualized appropriation of the tree, found in <a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>. From a comparison of <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6, 8</a> (in the Hebrew, 20, 22) with <a href="/2_chronicles/2-3.htm">2 Chronicles 2:3, 8</a>, and some other passages, we may be led to believe that the <span class="accented">cedar</span> as the name of timber was used occasionally very generically. Nevertheless, the very passages in question instance by name the other specific kinds of wood. Two of the chief kinds of cedar were the Lebanon and the Deodara, which is said not to have grown in Syria, but abounds in the Himalayas. And as the use of the Lebanon cedar for some <span class="accented">purposes</span> (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> for the <span class="accented">masts</span> of ships) is almost out of the question, it is exceedingly probable that this <span class="accented">Deodars</span> and some other varieties of pines are comprehended under the <span class="accented">eh-rez.</span> Dean Stanley points out what may be described as very interesting moral <span class="accented">landmark</span> uses of the celebrated cedars of Lebanon, in those passages which speak of Solomon's sweep of knowledge, commencing in the <span class="accented">dewing</span> direction from them (<a href="/1_kings/4-33.htm">1 Kings 4:33</a>), of the devouring fire that should begin with the bramble and reach high up to those cedars (in Jotham's parable, <a href="/judges/9-15.htm">Judges 9:15</a>), and (in the parable of Joash, King of Israel, to Amaziah, King of Judah, <a href="/2_chronicles/25-18.htm">2 Chronicles 25:18</a>) of the contempt with which the family of the cedars of Lebanon is supposed to hear of the matrimonial overtures of the family of the thistles of Lebanon. Stanley's pages ('Sinai and Palestine,' edit. 1866, pp. 414-414d) are full of interest on the subject of the cedars of Lebanon (see also full article in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:285, 286; and Dr. Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' pp. 197-200). Cedar was the choice wood for pillars and beams, boarding and ceiling of the finest houses; and alike the first and second temples (<a href="/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>) depended upon the supply of it. <span class="cmt_word">Under curtains</span>.
