This reflects the importance of maintaining order in the worship and service of God. The divisions suggest a system of rotation, ensuring that the duties were shared and that the temple was always guarded. This organization can be compared to the division of priests and Levites in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>, where the priestly duties were divided among the descendants of Aaron.<p><b>through their chief men</b><br>The mention of "chief men" highlights the leadership structure within the divisions. These leaders were responsible for overseeing the gatekeepers and ensuring that their duties were performed correctly. This mirrors the broader biblical principle of leadership and accountability, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>, where Moses appoints leaders over groups of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. The role of these chief men underscores the importance of godly leadership in maintaining the sanctity and order of worship.<p><b>had duties for ministering in the house of the LORD</b><br>The gatekeepers' duties were not merely about guarding the physical structure but were considered a form of ministry. This reflects the broader biblical theme that all service in the house of the LORD is a form of worship and ministry, not just the work of priests. The house of the LORD, referring to the temple, was the center of Israelite worship and the presence of God among His people. The gatekeepers' role was crucial in maintaining the holiness and security of this sacred space.<p><b>just as their relatives did</b><br>This phrase indicates that the gatekeepers' duties were part of a larger family responsibility, suggesting that service in the temple was often a family affair. This familial aspect of temple service is seen throughout the Old Testament, where certain families were designated for specific roles, such as the sons of Korah, who were also gatekeepers and singers (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-19.htm">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>). This continuity of service within families emphasizes the importance of passing down faith and responsibility from one generation to the next, a theme echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to teach God's commandments to their children.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gatekeepers.htm">Gatekeepers</a></b><br>These were Levites assigned to guard the gates of the temple.

Scripture treats these lists as historical fact, not legend; God really counted on specific fathers and sons to protect His house.<p>&#8226; That same concern for order appears in <a href="/1_chronicles/23-5.htm">1 Chronicles 23:5</a>, where David numbers &#8220;four thousand gatekeepers,&#8221; showing that protecting worship matters as much to the Lord as offering sacrifices.<p>&#8226; The idea of divinely assigned roles carries into the New Covenant people of God: &#8220;But in fact God has arranged the members of the body, every one of them, according to His design&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through their chief men</b><p>&#8226; Leadership flows through &#8220;their chief men,&#8221; meaning the heads of these families supervised the rotations.

The statement of this verse makes it evident that the names in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/26-2.htm" title="And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,">1Chronicles 26:2-11</a> represent the courses of the porters or warders. As the twenty-four sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun represented the twenty-four courses of musicians in 1 Chronicles 25, a similar classification might naturally be expected here. Accordingly, we actually find seven sons of Meshelemiah (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/26-2.htm" title="And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,">1Chronicles 26:2-3</a>), eight sons of Obed-edom (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/26-4.htm" title="Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethaneel the fifth.">1Chronicles 26:4-5</a>), and four sons of Hosah (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/26-10.htm" title="Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;)">1Chronicles 26:10-11</a>), which together make nineteen heads and classes. It remains to add the "sons" of Shemaiah son of Obed-edom. As the text stands, these appear to be six in number, which would give a total of twenty-five (7 + 8 + 4 + 6). But the connection of the Hebrew in <a href="/1_chronicles/26-7.htm" title="The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brothers were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.">1Chronicles 26:7</a> is so unusual as to suggest at once that something is wrong: and if we assume Obed-Elzabad to represent one original composite name, like Obed-edom, we get five "sons of Shemaiah," and so a total of twenty-four classes or courses of warders. (From this verse to the end of chapter 27 the Syriac and Arabic versions fail us.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Translate, <span class="cmt_word">To these divisions of the porters, as regards the chief men, belonged the charge together with their brethren to officiate in the house of the Lord.</span> According to the present chapter, then, the <span class="accented">divisions</span> add up to ninety-three. And if at any time of the history it were the case that these ninety-three were the leaders of groups among the total of "four thousand porters," it would put exactly forty-two under each of these ninety-three, leaving but one over. This number ninety-three, meantime, does not agree with the <span class="accented">two hundred and twelve</span> of <a href="/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>.

The conclusion may well be that the numbers varied in David's time and the other times severally;and that the date in question (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-22.htm">1 Chronicles 9:22</a>) was not the same with the date of David in our present chapter, but was a subsequent date nearer the time of the Captivity. There is, therefore, no special ground for doubting the accuracy of the numbers given in this chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/26-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1440;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
