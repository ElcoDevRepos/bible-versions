Asher's territory was located in the northern part of Israel, along the Mediterranean coast. This region was known for its fertile land and olive oil production, which is reflected in Jacob's blessing over Asher in <a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>, where he is described as having rich food and providing royal delicacies. The inclusion of Asher in this list highlights the unity among the tribes in supporting David, despite their geographical distance from the central regions of Israel.<p><b>40,000 fit for service:</b><br>The number 40,000 indicates a significant military contribution from the tribe of Asher. In the context of ancient Israel, this was a substantial force, suggesting that Asher was both populous and well-organized. The phrase "fit for service" implies that these men were not only numerous but also physically capable and ready to engage in military action. This readiness reflects the broader mobilization of Israelite tribes in support of David's kingship, as they recognized his anointing by God and the need for a united front against common enemies.<p><b>Prepared for battle:</b><br>Being "prepared for battle" suggests that the men of Asher were not only physically capable but also trained and equipped for warfare. This preparation would have included knowledge of military tactics, weaponry, and possibly experience in previous conflicts. The readiness of Asher's forces underscores the seriousness with which the tribes approached the consolidation of David's rule. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God preparing His people for the battles they face, both physical and spiritual. This preparation can be seen as a type of the spiritual readiness that believers are called to in the New Testament, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where Paul speaks of the armor of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asher.htm">Asher</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Asher, the eighth son of Jacob and Zilpah.

Their inclusion in the roster of warriors who rallied to David at Hebron shows that David&#8217;s kingship enjoyed broad national support. Earlier Scripture paints Asher as a tribe blessed with abundance (<a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24-25</a>), yet sometimes slow to join the fight (<a href="/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>). Here, however, Asher steps up. Their presence affirms the prophetic promise that all Israel would unite under the rightful king (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>40,000</b><p>&#8220;40,000&#8221; is a staggering figure for a single tribe. At the first wilderness census Asher counted 41,500 men of military age (<a href="/numbers/1-41.htm">Numbers 1:41</a>); decades later another tally showed 53,400 (<a href="/numbers/26-47.htm">Numbers 26:47</a>). The number in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-36.htm">1 Chronicles 12:36</a> sits between those totals and highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness in preserving and multiplying His people. Similar numbers appear when 40,000 armed men from Reuben, Gad, and half-Manasseh crossed the Jordan to help their brothers (<a href="/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>), underscoring the shared responsibility of Israel&#8217;s tribes to defend God&#8217;s purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fit for service</b><p>The phrase signals physical capability and maturity. According to God&#8217;s standard in the wilderness, men &#8220;twenty years of age or older&#8230;able to go to war&#8221; were counted (<a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>). Asher&#8217;s men meet that benchmark:<p>&#8226; They had the strength, skill, and discipline required of soldiers.<p>&#8226; They were willing to leave the security of home to stand with David, reflecting the call to be &#8220;useful to the Master and prepared for every good work&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-21.htm">2 Timothy 2:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Their fitness reminds believers today that God looks for readiness&#8212;spiritual, moral, and practical&#8212;when assigning tasks (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Prepared for battle</b><p>Readiness goes beyond fitness; it includes training, equipment, and mental resolve. David&#8217;s men from every tribe were &#8220;armed with all kinds of weapons of war&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-37.htm">1 Chronicles 12:37</a>) and wholehearted in their mission. Other passages underline the value of preparation: Nehemiah&#8217;s builders kept weapons close (<a href="/nehemiah/4-17.htm">Nehemiah 4:17</a>), and Paul urges believers to put on the full armor of God so they can stand firm (<a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>). Asher&#8217;s warriors illustrate that God expects His people to move from potential to preparedness, from ability to action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/12-36.htm">1 Chronicles 12:36</a> shows Asher decisively aligning with David by sending 40,000 men who were both capable and battle-ready. The verse testifies to God&#8217;s promise-keeping, the unity of Israel behind their anointed king, and the principle that those blessed by the Lord are called to be both fit and prepared to serve His purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">Expert in war.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">to order or marshal battle </span>(<span class= "ital">ad aciem struendam</span>).
