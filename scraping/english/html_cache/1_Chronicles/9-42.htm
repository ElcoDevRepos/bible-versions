The genealogical record here serves to establish lineage and continuity among the tribes of Israel, particularly the tribe of Benjamin. Genealogies in the Bible often emphasize the importance of family heritage and God's faithfulness through generations. The name "Jarah" is not widely mentioned elsewhere, highlighting the often obscure yet significant roles individuals played in biblical history.<p><b>Jarah was the father of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri;</b><br>Jarah's descendants, Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri, are listed, continuing the genealogical record. Alemeth is also a name associated with a Levitical city in the territory of Benjamin, suggesting a possible connection to priestly duties or land inheritance. Azmaveth is a name that appears in other contexts, such as a warrior in David's army, indicating the potential for martial or leadership roles within the family. Zimri, another descendant, shares a name with a king of Israel, though they are not the same person. These names reflect the cultural practice of naming children after notable figures or places, reinforcing identity and heritage.<p><b>and Zimri was the father of Moza.</b><br>The lineage continues with Moza, a name that appears in other genealogical records, emphasizing the importance of family lines in maintaining tribal identity and fulfilling God's promises to Israel. The genealogical records in Chronicles often serve to connect the post-exilic community to their ancestral roots, providing a sense of continuity and hope. This lineage, while seemingly mundane, underscores the broader biblical theme of God's providence and the unfolding of His plan through ordinary lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>A descendant of Saul, mentioned in the genealogies of the tribe of Benjamin.

9:39&#8211;41).<p>&#8226; By recording Saul&#8217;s line after Israel&#8217;s exile, the Chronicler shows that God preserved even a fallen dynasty, underscoring His faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that individual names matter; God&#8217;s redemptive plan moves forward one generation at a time (<a href="/bsb/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Though not the same man as the idolatrous King Ahaz of Judah (<a href="/2_kings/16-1.htm">2 Kings 16:1&#8211;4</a>), this namesake is still included, proving that a checkered past does not block God&#8217;s ongoing purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jarah was the father of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri</b><p>&#8220;Jarah was the father of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri&#8221;

Alemeth&#8217;s name appears again as a Levitical town (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-60.htm">1 Chronicles 6:60</a>), hinting that Saul&#8217;s heirs may have settled priestly territories, showing how mercy replaced judgment after Saul&#8217;s downfall.<p>&#8226; Azmaveth later surfaces among David&#8217;s mighty men (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-3.htm">1 Chronicles 12:3</a>), illustrating how members of Saul&#8217;s family eventually served the very house that replaced them&#8212;an image of reconciliation (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<p>&#8226;

The Chronicler&#8217;s post-exilic audience would have found hope here: if God preserved Saul&#8217;s line, He would surely preserve theirs (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, each father-son link foreshadows the ultimate lineage climaxing in Jesus Christ, &#8220;the Son of David, the Son of Abraham&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>), showing that no faithful record is wasted in God&#8217;s economy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/9-42.htm">1 Chronicles 9:42</a> is more than a list of obscure names. It demonstrates God&#8217;s unwavering memory of His people, the continuation of Saul&#8217;s family despite earlier judgment, and the steady march of redemption generation by generation. Every name confirms that the Lord keeps covenant, blesses fruitfulness, and weaves even fallen stories into His larger plan that ultimately leads to Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/9-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ahaz</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
