In the context of <a href="/1_chronicles/11.htm">1 Chronicles 11</a>, David is in the stronghold, likely the cave of Adullam, during a time of conflict with the Philistines. This longing is not just physical but also symbolic of a deeper spiritual thirst, reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>, where the psalmist expresses a longing for God. David's longing can also be seen as a type of Christ, who expressed thirst on the cross (<a href="/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28</a>), symbolizing His identification with human suffering.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water</b><br>David's expression of desire is spontaneous and heartfelt, revealing his connection to his hometown of Bethlehem. This request is not a command but a wistful yearning, showing his leadership style that inspires loyalty rather than demands it. The act of fetching water becomes a test of devotion for his mighty men, paralleling the devotion Christ's followers are called to exhibit. This moment foreshadows the living water that Jesus offers in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>, which quenches spiritual thirst.<p><b>from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!&#8221;</b><br>Bethlehem, David's birthplace, holds significant historical and prophetic importance. The well near the gate symbolizes life and sustenance, and its location at the gate suggests a place of community and gathering. Bethlehem is also the prophesied birthplace of Jesus (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>), linking David's longing to the future coming of the Messiah. The well's location in enemy-occupied territory underscores the risk and bravery required to fulfill David's wish, mirroring the sacrificial nature of Christ's mission. The act of retrieving water from this well becomes a profound demonstration of loyalty and courage, akin to the dedication Christ's followers are called to show.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his deep faith and leadership.

His craving is literal: a thirsty soldier-king in a dry cave.<p>- Scripture often uses physical thirst to mirror a deeper spiritual need. David later sang, &#8220;My soul thirsts for You&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>). The incident hints at that same heart-cry.<p>- Parallel account: <a href="/2_samuel/23-15.htm">2 Samuel 23:15</a> repeats the scene, confirming its historic reliability.<p>- Like Israel in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/17-3.htm">Exodus 17:3</a>) and the Samaritan woman (<a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13-14</a>), David&#8217;s longing points toward the ultimate &#8220;living water&#8221; God provides.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said</b><p>- David voices his desire; he does not issue a command. The words are spontaneous, overheard by mighty men who love him.<p>- &#8220;Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). What we say, even in passing, can move others to action for good or ill (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>).<p>- His openness fosters a culture of voluntary service rather than forced duty&#8212;an echo of <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a> where shepherds lead &#8220;not under compulsion, but willingly.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water</b><p>- The sigh reveals homesickness as much as thirst. Bethlehem&#8217;s water tasted like home, familiar and comforting.<p>- Three of his warriors respond, risking everything (1 Chron 11:18). Their act illustrates sacrificial love (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>) and points ahead to Christ, who meets our deepest thirst at His own peril (<a href="/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28-30</a>).<p>- &#8220;Whoever gives you even a cup of water because you belong to Christ will not lose his reward&#8221; (<a href="/mark/9-41.htm">Mark 9:41</a>). Service, no matter how simple, carries eternal value.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!</b><p>- Bethlehem is David&#8217;s birthplace (<a href="/1_samuel/17-12.htm">1 Samuel 17:12</a>) and would later be Messiah&#8217;s (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>; <a href="/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4-11</a>). The well by the gate symbolizes covenant heritage and God&#8217;s unfolding plan.<p>- The site is now enemy-held, reminding us that treasured things often lie behind spiritual battle lines (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p>- The gate was where elders met (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>). Drawing water there underscores the public, communal life David longs to reclaim when Israel is fully free.<p>- The men break through the Philistines, obtain the water, and David, overwhelmed, pours it out &#8220;to the LORD&#8221; (1 Chron 11:18-19), treating it as blood&#8212;too holy for personal use. Worship trumps gratification.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/11-17.htm">1 Chronicles 11:17</a> reveals more than a dusty king craving a sip. It shows David&#8217;s physical need echoing a spiritual thirst, his unguarded words stirring heroic loyalty, and Bethlehem&#8217;s well foreshadowing the Living Water offered in Christ. The episode calls believers to:<p>&#8226; Recognize our own deeper thirst beneath daily needs.<p>&#8226; Speak in ways that inspire voluntary, sacrificial service.<p>&#8226; Treasure covenant heritage, even when it lies in contested spaces.<p>&#8226; Pour out our best to the Lord, knowing that only He ultimately satisfies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">That is at</span> (in) <span class= "bld">the gate !</span>--No such well is now known.
