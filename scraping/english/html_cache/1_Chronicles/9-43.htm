Moza is a descendant of Saul, Israel's first king, highlighting the continuity of Saul's line despite his rejection by God. Genealogies in the Bible often serve to establish legitimacy and continuity of God's promises to His people. The mention of Moza and Binea underscores the importance of family lineage in maintaining tribal and national identity in ancient Israel.<p><b>Rephaiah was his son,</b><br>Rephaiah, as a descendant of Moza, continues the genealogical line. The name Rephaiah means "Jehovah has healed," which may reflect the hope and restoration associated with this lineage. In the broader biblical narrative, names often carry significant meaning and can reflect the character or destiny of individuals. This lineage is part of the tribe of Benjamin, which played a crucial role in the history of Israel, including providing the first king, Saul.<p><b>Elasah his son,</b><br>Elasah is another link in the genealogical chain. The name Elasah means "God has made," which can be seen as a testament to God's creative power and sovereignty over the lives of His people. This name, like others in the genealogy, reflects the deep spiritual heritage and the acknowledgment of God's role in the lives of the Israelites. The continuation of this line through Elasah emphasizes the preservation of the family and tribal heritage.<p><b>and Azel his son.</b><br>Azel is the final name in this particular genealogical segment. The name Azel means "noble" or "reserved," which may indicate a position of respect or distinction within the family or tribe. The genealogy concludes with Azel, showing the ongoing fulfillment of God's promises to His people through successive generations. This lineage, while not directly linked to the Messianic line, demonstrates the broader tapestry of God's work in Israel's history, preserving His people and their heritage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moza.htm">Moza</a></b><br>A descendant of Saul, Moza is part of the genealogical record that traces the lineage of the Benjamites.
