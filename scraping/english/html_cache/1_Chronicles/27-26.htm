The mention of his lineage suggests a family of some standing or recognition within the tribe of Judah. Chelub may be linked to Caleb, a prominent figure known for his faithfulness and leadership during the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>). This connection could imply a heritage of leadership and faith. The genealogical record emphasizes the importance of family lineage in Israelite society, where one's ancestry often determined social status and responsibilities.<p><b>was in charge of the workers in the fields</b><br>Ezri's role as overseer of the agricultural workers highlights the organized structure of King David's administration. Agriculture was a critical component of Israel's economy, and managing the workforce required significant leadership skills. This position indicates a level of trust and responsibility, as the productivity of the fields was essential for the sustenance of the nation. The division of labor and appointment of overseers reflect the wisdom in governance, ensuring that each aspect of the kingdom's needs was met efficiently.<p><b>who tilled the soil</b><br>Tilling the soil was a fundamental task in ancient Israel, necessary for preparing the land for planting crops. This phrase underscores the agrarian nature of Israelite society, where the majority of the population was engaged in farming. The process of tilling involved breaking up the ground to make it suitable for sowing seeds, a task that required both skill and physical labor. The imagery of tilling the soil can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual preparation, as seen in the parable of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3-9</a>), where the condition of the soil represents the readiness of the heart to receive God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezri.htm">Ezri</a></b><br>A leader appointed by King David, responsible for overseeing the agricultural workers.

tying Ezri to Chelub anchors him in a real family line, echoing how Scripture grounds faith in history (<a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23-38</a>).<p>- The name &#8220;Chelub&#8221; recalls Caleb&#8217;s family line (<a href="/joshua/14-13.htm">Joshua 14:13-14</a>), hinting that steadfast, faith-filled heritage often produces dependable servants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was in charge</b><p>- David delegated responsibilities so &#8220;all things should be done decently and in order&#8221;

to partner in His providence.<p>- Ezri&#8217;s supervision ensured faithful stewardship of the land promised to Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-10</a>), guarding prosperity and covenant blessing (<a href="/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/27-26.htm">1 Chronicles 27:26</a> records that &#8220;Ezri son of Chelub was in charge of the workers in the fields who tilled the soil.&#8221; Far from a throwaway detail, the verse reveals God&#8217;s orderly kingdom, where every person&#8212;from king to farmhand&#8212;plays a vital, God-appointed part. Ezri&#8217;s leadership, rooted in a faithful lineage, affirms the value of diligent labor and models servant oversight.
