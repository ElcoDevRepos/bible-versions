In this context, Shimei is a Levite, and his descendants are part of the Levitical duties in the temple. The Levites were set apart for religious service, and their genealogies were meticulously recorded to ensure the proper fulfillment of their roles. This highlights the importance of lineage and heritage in maintaining the sanctity and order of worship in Israel.<p><b>Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran&#8212;three in all:</b><br>These names represent the sons of Shimei, each of whom would have had specific roles or responsibilities within the Levitical structure. The mention of their names signifies their importance in the family lineage and their contribution to the religious life of Israel. The number three often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in biblical numerology, suggesting that these three sons were sufficient to fulfill the duties assigned to their family line.<p><b>These were the heads of the families of Ladan:</b><br>Ladan, also known as Libni in some translations, is another Levitical family line. The heads of families were responsible for leading their households and ensuring that their family members adhered to their religious duties. This phrase underscores the organizational structure within the tribe of Levi, where leadership was crucial for maintaining the order and function of temple services. The role of family heads also reflects the broader biblical theme of leadership and stewardship, as seen in other scriptural examples such as Moses and Aaron.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shimei.htm">Shimei</a></b><br>A Levite, descendant of Gershon, and father of Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran.

In the wider context (vv. 7&#8211;11) David is assigning Levites by clan for future temple service. By naming Shimei&#8217;s line, Scripture anchors their lineage in the covenant family, just as earlier genealogies did for Levi himself (<a href="/exodus/6-16.htm">Exodus 6:16</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-7.htm">1 Chronicles 23:7</a>). Every detail underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness to keep track of those who will serve Him&#8212;no name is lost, no family overlooked.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran&#8212;three in all</b><p>The verse immediately lists the sons:<p>&#8226; Shelomoth<p>&#8226; Haziel<p>&#8226; Haran<p>&#8220;Three in all&#8221; underlines completeness; there are precisely three, no more, no less. This deliberate numbering mirrors other Levitical counts (<a href="/numbers/4-36.htm">Numbers 4:36&#8211;40</a>) and highlights the care with which David organized temple personnel (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3&#8211;5</a>). Later, a Shelomith (same name variant) supervises sacred treasures (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-26.htm">1 Chronicles 26:26&#8211;28</a>), showing how these men or their descendants took tangible roles in guarding what was holy (<a href="/2_chronicles/31-12.htm">2 Chronicles 31:12</a>). Each name, therefore, is both a personal identity and a testimony that God appoints specific people for specific tasks.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>These were the heads of the families of Ladan</b><p>The verse concludes by telling us these three sons of Shimei &#8220;were the heads of the families of Ladan.&#8221; Ladan (also called Libni in <a href="/numbers/3-18.htm">Numbers 3:18, 24</a>) is a branch of the Gershonite Levites. Being &#8220;heads&#8221; means leadership:<p>&#8226; Responsibility for organizing their sub-clans in worship duties (<a href="/numbers/4-24.htm">Numbers 4:24-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Oversight of the sacred tent&#8217;s fabrics and cords (<a href="/numbers/3-25.htm">Numbers 3:25-26</a>), duties later transferred to temple service (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24-26</a>).<p>Their leadership ensured orderly worship and preservation of holiness&#8212;foreshadowing the church&#8217;s call today to serve &#8220;decently and in order&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>). By recording their headship, the text affirms that God honors structures of authority within His people and equips chosen individuals to guide others.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/23-9.htm">1 Chronicles 23:9</a> is more than a genealogical footnote. It certifies that God knows and appoints every servant in His house. Shimei&#8217;s three sons&#8212;Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran&#8212;are counted as leaders of the Ladanite branch of Gershonite Levites, entrusted with vital temple responsibilities. Their precise listing reinforces the accuracy of Scripture, the importance of orderly worship, and the assurance that God faithfully records and uses the lives of those dedicated to His service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">heads of the father-houses to Laadan.</span> The names seem to be at once those of the clans, or guilds, and of their existing chiefs.
