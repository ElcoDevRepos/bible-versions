It was a fertile area, suitable for agriculture and livestock, which is significant for the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh who settled there. Gilead's location made it a buffer zone between Israel and the surrounding nations, often placing it at the center of conflicts. The region's name is associated with the patriarch Jacob, who called it "Galeed" in <a href="/genesis/31-47.htm">Genesis 31:47-48</a>, marking a covenant with Laban.<p><b>in Bashan and its towns</b><br>Bashan was a fertile and prosperous region north of Gilead, known for its rich pastures and strong cattle, as referenced in <a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>. It was conquered by the Israelites under Moses' leadership (<a href="/deuteronomy/3.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1-5</a>) and allocated to the half-tribe of Manasseh. Bashan's king, Og, was one of the last of the Rephaim, a race of giants, which highlights the miraculous nature of Israel's victory. The region's towns were centers of trade and agriculture, contributing to the wealth and stability of the tribes residing there.<p><b>and throughout the pasturelands of Sharon</b><br>Sharon refers to a fertile coastal plain in Israel, known for its beauty and lush vegetation, as mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/35-2.htm">Isaiah 35:2</a>. However, in this context, it likely refers to a different Sharon located east of the Jordan, near Gilead and Bashan. The pasturelands were ideal for grazing livestock, which was a primary occupation for the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh.
