David's involvement underscores his role as a godly leader who prioritizes the spiritual well-being of the nation. The elders represent the tribal leaders, indicating a unified national effort. The commanders of thousands reflect the military organization, suggesting the importance of order and strength in this sacred task. This assembly of leaders mirrors the unity seen in other biblical events, such as the gathering of leaders in <a href="/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24:1-11</a>.<p><b>went with rejoicing</b><br>The act of rejoicing signifies the joy and reverence associated with the presence of God symbolized by the Ark. This joy is a common theme in Scripture when God's presence is acknowledged, as seen in <a href="/psalms/100-2.htm">Psalm 100:2</a>, which calls for serving the Lord with gladness. The rejoicing also contrasts with the earlier failed attempt to move the Ark, which resulted in tragedy (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-9.htm">1 Chronicles 13:9-10</a>). This time, the proper reverence and procedures are followed, leading to a celebration.<p><b>to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant is central to Israel's worship, representing God's throne on earth and His covenant with Israel. It contained the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and manna, symbolizing God's guidance, authority, and provision. The Ark's movement signifies a shift in Israel's spiritual focus, as it is being brought to Jerusalem, the future center of worship. This act foreshadows the establishment of the Temple and the centralization of worship in Jerusalem, as prophesied in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>.<p><b>from the house of Obed-edom</b><br>Obed-edom's house had been blessed during the Ark's stay, as noted in <a href="/1_chronicles/13-14.htm">1 Chronicles 13:14</a>. This blessing underscores the Ark's significance and the favor of God upon those who honor His presence. Obed-edom, a Gittite, represents the inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan, prefiguring the New Testament revelation of the Gospel to all nations (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).

A slight change in the Hebrew (omission of the article; so Syriac and one MS. of LXX.) will improve the sense: "And it came to pass, David and the elders . . . were walking to bring up the Ark."<p><span class= "bld">To bring up the ark.</span>--<span class= "bld">"</span>Into the city of David" (Samuel).<p><span class= "bld">The ark of the covenant of the Lord.</span>--A special title of the Ark, which has not occurred before in this history. It is not read in the parallel passage of Samuel, where we find only "ark of God," and "ark of <span class= "ital">Jehovah."</span> The phrase may therefore indicate that the chronicler had another source besides that book. (Comp. <a href="/joshua/3-3.htm" title="And they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall remove from your place, and go after it.">Joshua 3:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/3-17.htm" title="And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.">Joshua 3:17</a>.) The parallel (<a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm" title="And it was told king David, saying, The LORD has blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.">2Samuel 6:12</a>) makes no mention of <span class= "ital">"</span>the elders and captains," but merely states in brief and somewhat abrupt fashion that David went and brought up the Ark, because he had heard of its bringing a blessing upon the house of Obed-edom.<p><span class= "bld">With joy.</span>--With set rejoicings and festal mirth.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/15-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
