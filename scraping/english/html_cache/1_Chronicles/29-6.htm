In the tribal society of ancient Israel, family leaders held significant authority and responsibility. They were often involved in decision-making processes and represented their families in communal matters. This structure is seen throughout the Old Testament, where family lineage and leadership are emphasized, such as in the genealogies of Genesis and the division of land in Joshua.<p><b>the officers of the tribes of Israel</b><br>These officers were likely the tribal leaders or princes who had administrative and military responsibilities. Each tribe had its own leadership structure, and these officers played a crucial role in maintaining order and implementing the king's directives. The tribal system was central to Israel's identity, as seen in the blessings of Jacob in <a href="/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a> and the census in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>.<p><b>the commanders of thousands and of hundreds</b><br>This phrase indicates a military hierarchy within Israel, with commanders responsible for different sized units. The organization of the military into thousands and hundreds is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, reflecting a structured and disciplined approach to warfare. This system is also mentioned in <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>, where Moses appoints leaders over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens to help govern the people.<p><b>and the officials in charge of the king&#8217;s work</b><br>These officials were responsible for overseeing various aspects of the king's projects and administration. This could include construction, taxation, and other governmental duties. The mention of the king's work highlights the centralized authority of the monarchy, which was established under Saul and solidified under David and Solomon. The role of such officials is seen in the building of the Temple under Solomon in <a href="/1_kings/5.htm">1 Kings 5</a>.<p><b>gave willingly</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the voluntary nature of the contributions made by the leaders. It reflects a heart of generosity and commitment to the work of God, as seen in the construction of the Tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21-29</a>, where the people gave freely. This willingness to give is a model for Christian stewardship and reflects the New Testament teaching in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where God loves a cheerful giver.
