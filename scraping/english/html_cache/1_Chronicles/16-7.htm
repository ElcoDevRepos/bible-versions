But the words seem really intended to introduce the long ode which follows, and therefore we should perhaps render, "On that day, then David gave for the first time into the hands of Asaph and his brethren, for giving thanks to Jehovah, Give thanks unto the Lord,'" &c., the whole psalm being regarded as the object of the verb. It may be that this composite hymn was sung in the time of the compiler, on the anniversary of the removal of the Ark, which may in after-times have been commemorated by a special service. Hence it was easy to infer that it was the ode sung at the original service under David. The words "then" ('<span class= "ital">az</span>) and "on that day" certainly seem to introduce the psalm. (Comp, their use, <a href="/exodus/15-1.htm" title="Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.">Exodus 15:1</a>, and <a href="/judges/5-1.htm" title="Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,">Judges 5:1</a>. Comp. also <a href="/2_chronicles/7-6.htm" title="And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endures for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.">2Chronicles 7:6</a>.)<p>But the ambiguity of <a href="/1_chronicles/16-7.htm" title="Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brothers.">1Chronicles 16:7</a> may be taken along with other considerations to indicate that this ode does not constitute an original part of the Chronicles, but has been inserted by a later hand. For (1) the Psalm is clearly a <span class= "ital">cento</span> consisting of portions of three others extant in the Psalter, and so loosely patched together that the seams are quite visible; (2) the Psalter itself does not refer the three psalms in question to David; if, however, the editors of the Psalter had read in the Chronicles a clear assertion of Davidic authorship, they would hardly have left them anonymous; (3) all critics agree that it is not here expressly said that David composed this ode, and, in fact, its ideas and language betray a later origin than the Davidic age; and (4) it contains no specific allusion to the occasion for which it purports to have been written. If no record was preserved of the psalms actually sung at the festival, it was natural that some editor should attempt to supply the apparent <span class= "ital">lacuna</span> from the Psalter. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The rendering should run, On <span class="accented">that day did David first commit to the hand of Asaph and his brethren to render praises to Jehovah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after the following manner and words.
