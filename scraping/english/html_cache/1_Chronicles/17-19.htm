The use of "LORD" in all capitals signifies the Hebrew name Yahweh, emphasizing God's eternal and unchanging nature. This invocation sets the tone for a prayerful and reverent address to God, recognizing His authority and holiness.<p><b>For the sake of Your servant</b><br>"Your servant" refers to David, the king of Israel, who is often depicted as a model of servanthood to God. This phrase highlights the covenant relationship between God and David, where David is seen as God's chosen servant. It reflects the biblical theme of God working through His chosen individuals to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like Moses and the prophets.<p><b>and according to Your own heart</b><br>This phrase underscores the idea that God's actions are motivated by His own will and character, not by human merit. It reflects the biblical teaching that God's plans are rooted in His perfect wisdom and love. The concept of God's heart is significant in Scripture, indicating His desires and intentions, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>, where David is described as a man after God's own heart.<p><b>You have accomplished this great thing</b><br>The "great thing" refers to God's promise to establish David's dynasty, which is a pivotal moment in biblical history. This promise is part of the Davidic Covenant, where God assures David that his lineage will endure forever, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Messiah. This accomplishment is a testament to God's faithfulness and power, as He brings His promises to fruition.<p><b>and made known all these great promises.</b><br>The "great promises" include the assurance of a lasting dynasty for David and the coming of a future king, the Messiah. These promises are central to the biblical narrative, pointing to the hope of redemption and the establishment of God's kingdom. The fulfillment of these promises is seen in the New Testament, where Jesus is recognized as the descendant of David and the fulfillment of God's covenant. This phrase emphasizes God's revelation of His plans to His people, demonstrating His desire for them to understand His purposes and trust in His faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, chosen by God, who desires to build a temple for the Lord.

David begins with the covenant name of God, the very name by which the Lord revealed Himself to Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Addressing God as &#8220;LORD&#8221; carries the weight of supreme authority and covenant faithfulness, echoed in <a href="/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>, &#8220;O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth!&#8221;<p>&#8226; The invocation centers the prayer on God&#8217;s glory, much like Isaiah&#8217;s vision in <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1&#8211;3</a>, where the seraphim cry, &#8220;Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hosts.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the sake of Your servant</b><p>&#8226; David identifies himself as God&#8217;s servant, highlighting humility rather than royal privilege (<a href="/2_samuel/7-18.htm">2 Samuel 7:18&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; In Scripture, true greatness is framed by servanthood&#8212;see <a href="/psalms/86-16.htm">Psalm 86:16</a>, &#8220;Save Your servant who trusts in You,&#8221; and <a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26</a>, &#8220;Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.&#8221;<p>&#8226; David sees God&#8217;s action as motivated by covenant loyalty toward His servant&#8212;a theme reflected when Solomon later prays, &#8220;You have kept Your servant David my father&#8221;

<a href="/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5, 11</a>).<p>&#8226; This line reminds us that every covenant promise flows from God&#8217;s character of steadfast love. <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a> affirms, &#8220;For I know the plans I have for you&#8230; plans for welfare and not for disaster.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse therefore calls us to rest in the assurance that God&#8217;s plans come straight from His heart of grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have accomplished this great thing</b><p>&#8226;

(<a href="/deuteronomy/3-24.htm">Deuteronomy 3:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, the &#8220;great thing&#8221; blossoms in Jesus, the Son of David, as proclaimed in <a href="/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68&#8211;69</a>, &#8220;Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel&#8230; He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and made known all these great promises</b><p>&#8226; Revelation is grace: God not only acts but also explains His actions. <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a> echoes this principle, &#8220;Surely the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The specific promises include an eternal throne, a secure kingdom, and a Father&#8211;son relationship (<a href="/1_chronicles/17-11.htm">1 Chronicles 17:11&#8211;14</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; These promises fold into the broader biblical thread from <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2&#8211;3</a> to <a href="/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a>, assuring believers that they share in &#8220;precious and magnificent promises.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/17-19.htm">1 Chronicles 17:19</a> is David&#8217;s awe-filled acknowledgment that God&#8217;s covenant blessings spring entirely from God&#8217;s own heart, for the benefit of His servant, and have already been powerfully set in motion.
