The division into twenty-four groups reflects the organized structure of worship in the temple, ensuring continuous praise and worship. The number twelve is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness or divine government, as seen in the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles.<p><b>to Hashabiah</b><br>Hashabiah is a name that appears several times in the Old Testament, often associated with Levitical duties. The name means "Yahweh has considered" or "Yahweh has regarded," reflecting a divine acknowledgment or favor.
