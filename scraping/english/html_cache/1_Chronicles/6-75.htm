It is situated in the region of Naphtali, one of the tribes of Israel. The exact location of Hukok is not definitively known today, but it is believed to be near the Sea of Galilee. This area was significant in biblical times for its fertile land and strategic location. The mention of Hukok in the context of Levitical cities underscores the importance of providing for the Levites, who were set apart for religious duties and did not have a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. This allocation reflects the broader biblical principle of supporting those dedicated to spiritual service.<p><b>and Rehob</b><br>Rehob is another city allocated to the Levites, also located in the territory of Naphtali. The name Rehob means "broad" or "spacious," which may indicate the nature of the land or its strategic importance. Rehob is mentioned in other parts of the Bible, such as in the context of the spies sent by Moses (<a href="/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>). The allocation of Rehob to the Levites highlights the integration of spiritual and communal life in Israel, where cities were designated to support the religious leaders and ensure the spiritual well-being of the nation.<p><b>together with their pasturelands</b><br>The inclusion of pasturelands with the cities given to the Levites is significant. Since the Levites did not receive a large territorial inheritance, these pasturelands were essential for their sustenance and livelihood. The provision of pasturelands ensured that the Levites could maintain livestock, which was a crucial part of the agrarian economy and daily life in ancient Israel. This arrangement reflects the biblical principle of God's provision for those who serve Him, ensuring that their physical needs are met while they focus on their spiritual duties. The concept of pasturelands also connects to the imagery of God as a shepherd, caring for His people and providing for their needs, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture and finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hukok.htm">Hukok</a></b><br>A town allotted to the tribe of Asher, mentioned in the context of the Levitical cities.

God not only numbers the stars (<a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>) but also records specific villages, underlining His intimate involvement in practical, day-to-day provision for His servants.<p>&#8226; When modern readers see Hukok on the list, we can be encouraged that our own &#8220;ordinary&#8221; setting is known to God and can be used for His purposes, just as this town served the spiritual life of the nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Rehob</b><p>&#8226; Rehob, another city in Asher (<a href="/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28</a>; 21:31), joins Hukok in the same verse, reinforcing the pattern of multiple towns working together to support the priesthood.<p>&#8226; The pairing of these towns illustrates cooperation within the wider covenant community. Just as the Levites depended on the generosity of several tribal territories, today&#8217;s church ministry flourishes when believers partner together (<a href="/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15-17</a>; 3 <a href="/bsb/john/5.htm">John 5-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Rehob&#8217;s inclusion testifies that no community is too small or obscure to contribute to God&#8217;s redemptive plan (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26-29</a>). The Lord values faithfulness over fame.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>together with their pasturelands</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;together with their pasturelands&#8221; (also in <a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2-3</a>) signals that the Levites received not only urban centers but also surrounding fields for livestock and gardens. This ensured their daily needs were met so they could focus on worship and teaching (<a href="/nehemiah/13-10.htm">Nehemiah 13:10-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The provision of pasturelands models a principle repeated in both Testaments: those who serve spiritually should be cared for materially (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>; <a href="/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; These agricultural parcels also created natural gathering spaces where Levites could mentor families in God&#8217;s Word, blending work and worship in a holistic way (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording the land distribution, Scripture assures us that God&#8217;s plan encompasses practical stewardship&#8212;He provides structures that sustain ministry and bless communities (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-75.htm">1 Chronicles 6:75</a> may read like a simple inventory, yet it reveals God&#8217;s meticulous care for His servants and His call for every believer and community to participate in sustaining ministry. Hukok and Rehob, with their pasturelands, stand as monuments to a faithful God who supplies, a cooperative people who give, and a timeless principle: when God&#8217;s workers are supported, worship thrives and the whole nation benefits.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/6-75.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Hukok,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1465;&#1511;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#363;&#183;q&#333;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2712.htm">Strong's 2712: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hukkok -- a place in Naphtali</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Rehob,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7340.htm">Strong's 7340: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rechob</span><br /><br /><span class="word">together with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Direct object marker<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_853.htm">Strong's 853: </a> </span><span class="str2">Untranslatable mark of the accusative case</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their pasturelands.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7713;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#353;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4054.htm">Strong's 4054: </a> </span><span class="str2">A suburb, the area around a, building, the margin of the sea</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/1_chronicles/6-75.htm">1 Chronicles 6:75 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/1_chronicles/6-75.htm">1 Chronicles 6:75 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/1_chronicles/6-75.htm">1 Chronicles 6:75 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/1_chronicles/6-75.htm">1 Chronicles 6:75 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/1_chronicles/6-75.htm">1 Chronicles 6:75 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/1_chronicles/6-75.htm">1 Chronicles 6:75  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/1_chronicles/6-75.htm">1 Chronicles 6:75 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/1_chronicles/6-75.htm">1 Chronicles 6:75 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/1_chronicles/6-75.htm">1 Chronicles 6:75 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/1_chronicles/6-75.htm">1 Chronicles 6:75 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_chronicles/6-75.htm">OT History: 1 Chronicles 6:75 And Hukok with its suburbs and Rehob (1 Chron. 1Ch iCh i Ch 1 chr 1chr)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/1_chronicles/6-74.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 6:74"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 6:74" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/1_chronicles/6-76.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 6:76"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 6:76" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
