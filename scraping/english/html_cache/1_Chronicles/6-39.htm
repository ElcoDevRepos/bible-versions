Both Heman and Asaph were Levites, specifically from the line of Gershon, one of the three main Levitical families. Asaph is a significant figure in the Bible, known for his role as a chief musician and a seer. He is credited with authoring several Psalms (Psalms 50, 73-83), which reflect his deep spiritual insight and prophetic gift. The mention of Asaph here highlights the importance of music and worship in the temple service, as well as the continuity of Levitical duties through family lines.<p><b>who served at his right hand</b><br>Serving at the right hand signifies a position of honor and authority. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the right hand was considered the place of power and favor. Asaph's role at Heman's right hand underscores his importance in the musical and worship leadership of Israel. This phrase also reflects the organized structure of temple worship, where roles and responsibilities were clearly defined. The right-hand position can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as sitting at the right hand of God (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>), symbolizing His authority and preeminence.<p><b>Asaph the son of Berechiah</b><br>Asaph is identified as the son of Berechiah, providing a genealogical link that establishes his Levitical heritage. Berechiah's name means "Yahweh blesses," which may reflect the family's devotion and the blessings associated with their service in the temple. This lineage is important for validating Asaph's role and authority as a leader in worship. Genealogies in the Bible often serve to confirm the fulfillment of God's promises through specific family lines, emphasizing the faithfulness of God across generations.<p><b>the son of Shimea</b><br>Shimea, also known as Shemaiah in some biblical references, is part of Asaph's genealogy. This connection further solidifies Asaph's Levitical credentials and his rightful place in the temple service. The mention of Shimea ties Asaph to the broader narrative of Israel's history, where genealogies were crucial for maintaining tribal identities and inheritance rights. This lineage also highlights the continuity of worship practices and the transmission of spiritual responsibilities from one generation to the next, reflecting the enduring nature of God's covenant with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heman.htm">Heman</a></b><br>A prominent Levite musician and seer during the time of King David, known for his role in temple worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>A Levite and chief musician, appointed by David to lead worship.

By calling Asaph Heman&#8217;s &#8220;kinsman,&#8221; Scripture reminds us that temple music was entrusted to one extended Levitical family. God wove worship into the DNA of this clan so that praise remained pure and biblically grounded (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Asaph&#8217;s name appears in the headings of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73-83</a>, showing how the Spirit used him&#8212;and later descendants (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-14.htm">2 Chronicles 20:14</a>)&#8212;to give Israel a lasting songbook. What started as family duty blossomed into Scripture that still calls people to trust God (<a href="/psalms/73-23.htm">Psalm 73:23-28</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-12.htm">Hebrews 2:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who served at his right hand</b><p>&#8226; In ancient culture the right hand signified favor, authority, and partnership (<a href="/psalms/16-8.htm">Psalm 16:8</a>; 110:1). Standing at Heman&#8217;s right communicated both support and a shared mandate.<p>&#8226; Practical outcome: one voice did not dominate worship. Instead, gifted leaders worked side by side, modeling unity to the congregation (1 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 14</a>:26, 40).<p>&#8226; Asaph&#8217;s later prominence&#8212;he &#8220;prophesied under the order of the king&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-2.htm">1 Chronicles 25:2</a>)&#8212;grew out of faithful service in a supporting role. God often entrusts greater influence to those who first learn to serve (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>; <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Asaph the son of Berechiah</b><p>&#8226; Naming Berechiah roots Asaph in a godly household.

The pattern echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>: parents pass faith along intentionally, and children become ready tools in God&#8217;s hand (2 <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; When worshipers sang an &#8220;Asaph Psalm,&#8221; they touched the legacy of a father who invested in his son.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the son of Shimea</b><p>&#8226; Shimea (also spelled Shemaiah) links Asaph back another generation to Levi through Gershom (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-42.htm">1 Chronicles 6:42-43</a>). Each step reinforces God&#8217;s covenant promise that Levites would minister before Him forever (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-5.htm">Deuteronomy 18:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The genealogy also highlights continuity amid exile and return. Centuries later, descendants of Asaph helped re-establish worship after captivity (<a href="/ezra/2-41.htm">Ezra 2:41</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-46.htm">Nehemiah 12:46</a>). God preserves His purposes even when circumstances shake His people (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-39.htm">1 Chronicles 6:39</a> reminds us that worship leadership is relational, generational, and God-appointed. Asaph, a close relative to Heman, began by serving at the right hand, received training from faithful forefathers, and left songs that still draw hearts to the Lord. The verse invites believers today to value family discipleship, humbly support one another in ministry, and trust God to carry His praise forward through every generation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39-43) The pedigree of Asaph the Gershonite, traced back through thirteen names to Levi. That of Heman names twenty ancestors for the same period of time. This is one more illustration of the common usage of overleaping names in these genealogies.<p>(39) <span class= "bld">His brother Asaph.</span>--Asaph was Heman's brother (1) as a Levite; (2) as a choir-master.<p>The striking agreement of the line of Heman with that of the Kohathites, detailed in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-22.htm" title="The sons of Kohath; Amminadab his son, Korah his son, Assir his son,">1Chronicles 6:22-28</a> above, has led critics to look for a like coincidence between the line of Asaph as given here, and that of the Gershonites in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-20.htm" title="Of Gershom; Libni his son, Jahath his son, Zimmah his son,">1Chronicles 6:20-21</a>. There, however, we have only seven names, here there are thirteen. Still we observe that in the former passage the three names, Jahath, Zimmah, and Zerah appear in <span class= "ital">the same order of lineal descent</span> from Gershon as in the present list; while the Adaiah of <a href="/1_chronicles/6-41.htm" title="The son of Ethni, the son of Zerah, the son of Adaiah,">1Chronicles 6:41</a> obviously answers to the Iddo of <a href="/1_chronicles/6-21.htm" title="Joah his son, Iddo his son, Zerah his son, Jeaterai his son.">1Chronicles 6:21</a>, and Ethni (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-41.htm" title="The son of Ethni, the son of Zerah, the son of Adaiah,">1Chronicles 6:41</a>) is in Hebrew writing not unlike Jeaterai; and we are already familiar with the fact that genealogies sometimes recur in abbreviated forms. (Comp. <a href="/context/ezra/7-1.htm" title="Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,">Ezra 7:1-5</a>, with the line of Aaron in the present chapter.) Upon the whole, therefore, if the suggested identifications be correct, it appears that Asaph's pedigree has really been partially anticipated in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-20.htm" title="Of Gershom; Libni his son, Jahath his son, Zimmah his son,">1Chronicles 6:20-21</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Asaph</span> is called <span class="cmt_word">brother</span> of Heman, either as brother in office or generally as relative in the degree of cousin by many removes.
