The inclusion of their names highlights their importance in the lineage and history of Israel. The name Beriah means "in trouble" or "misfortune," which may reflect the circumstances of his birth or life. Shema, meaning "hear" or "obey," is a name that appears multiple times in the Old Testament, indicating a common name with significant meaning. These individuals are noted for their leadership roles, suggesting they were influential in their community.<p><b>(who were the heads of families living in Aijalon</b><br>Aijalon is a city located in the territory of the tribe of Dan, although it was also associated with Benjamin. It is strategically situated in a valley that served as a key route for travel and trade. The mention of Beriah and Shema as heads of families in Aijalon indicates their leadership and possibly their role in maintaining the security and prosperity of the area. Aijalon is historically significant as the site of a miraculous event during Joshua's battle against the Amorites, where the sun stood still (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12-14</a>). This connection underscores the city's importance in Israel's history.<p><b>and who drove out the inhabitants of Gath)</b><br>Gath was one of the five major Philistine cities and is often associated with conflict against Israel. The act of driving out the inhabitants of Gath suggests a military victory or a successful campaign led by Beriah and Shema. This action would have been significant in securing the region for the Israelites and demonstrates the ongoing struggle between Israel and the Philistines. Gath is famously known as the hometown of Goliath, the giant defeated by David (1 Samuel 17). The expulsion of its inhabitants by leaders from Benjamin reflects the broader narrative of Israel's battles against the Philistines and God's deliverance of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/beriah.htm">Beriah</a></b><br>A descendant of Benjamin, Beriah is mentioned as a leader or head of a family.

Taken at face value, the verse celebrates two Benjamite leaders who faithfully shepherded their households, settled a strategic town, and routed Philistine squatters. Their story affirms God&#8217;s meticulous faithfulness: He names real people, honors godly leadership, positions His servants where they are needed, and empowers them to defeat formidable foes. In every generation, His people can trust that obedience, courage, and reliance on His strength will secure both their households and their witness for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Beriah also, and Shema.</span>--After these two names the Masoretic punctuators have put a stop.
