David's reign was marked by significant military and political achievements, and his age signifies the end of an era. The phrase "full of years" implies a life lived with purpose and fulfillment, echoing the biblical theme of a life well-lived in service to God. This mirrors the patriarchs like Abraham and Isaac, who also were described as "full of years" at the end of their lives (<a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8, 35</a>:29).<p><b>he installed his son Solomon as king</b><br>David's decision to install Solomon as king was a fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would succeed him and build the temple (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). This act of installing Solomon is significant as it demonstrates David's obedience to God's will, despite other potential heirs like Adonijah. The installation of Solomon prefigures the peaceful and wise reign that would follow, contrasting with David's war-filled reign. Solomon's kingship is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate King of Peace and Wisdom.<p><b>over Israel</b><br>The phrase "over Israel" emphasizes the united kingdom under David and Solomon, a period of relative peace and prosperity. This unity is significant in biblical history, as it represents the ideal state of God's people under a divinely appointed king. The united monarchy under David and Solomon is often seen as a foreshadowing of the Messianic kingdom, where Christ will reign over a united people of God. Solomon's reign over Israel also sets the stage for the building of the temple, a central place of worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and his leadership.

Earlier, the Lord had named Solomon as heir (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9&#8211;10</a>; 28:5&#8211;6), and David now obeys that clear word.<p>&#8226; By directly &#8220;installing&#8221; Solomon (cf. <a href="/1_kings/1-29.htm">1 Kings 1:29&#8211;35</a>), David cuts short Adonijah&#8217;s self-promotion (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>). Fathers protect legacy by ensuring God&#8217;s choice prevails.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s public endorsement fosters unity, much like Moses commissioning Joshua (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7&#8211;8</a>). Personal faithfulness protects the community from division.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as king over Israel</b><p>&#8226; The phrase confirms national scope. Solomon is not merely David&#8217;s successor; he is God&#8217;s chosen shepherd for all twelve tribes (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-4.htm">1 Chronicles 28:4</a>).<p>&#8226; This transfer secures the messianic line promised in the Davidic Covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>). God&#8217;s redemptive plan continues unabated.<p>&#8226; A peaceful, orderly transition anticipates Solomon&#8217;s reign of peace and the temple he will build (<a href="/1_kings/5-4.htm">1 Kings 5:4&#8211;5</a>), demonstrating that God values stability for His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/23-1.htm">1 Chronicles 23:1</a> marks a deliberate, God-honoring handoff. David, satisfied with years and service, obeys God by installing Solomon so that the kingdom&#8212;and God&#8217;s promises&#8212;move forward without turmoil. The verse models trusting God&#8217;s timing, fulfilling parental responsibility, and safeguarding covenant purposes for the good of all Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">So when David was old and full of days.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Now David had become old and satisfied with days.</span> (See <a href="/genesis/35-29.htm" title="And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.">Genesis 35:29</a>; <a href="/job/42-17.htm" title="So Job died, being old and full of days.">Job 42:17</a>; where both terms, which are verbs here, appear as adjectives.) Perhaps our pointing is wrong.

(Comp. 1 Chronicles 20, introductory remarks.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David... made Solomon his son king over Israel</span>. These words give the key note of what remains in this book. David made his son king, as he himself acknowledges (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>), under the superintending direction of God. The manner in which the formal event was precipitated by the conduct of Adonijah is found at length in <a href="/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11-53</a>. The original occasion alluded to there more than once, on which David promised, "and sware" to Bathsheba, that her son should be his chief heir and successor to the throne, is not distinctly recorded. We can easily assign one convenient place in the history for it to have found monition, viz. in <a href="/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>. The brevity of the statement which composes this verse, when compared with all the deeply interesting matter recorded in <a href="/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11-53</a>, is one among many other very clear illustrations of the purposed silence of our present history in certain directions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/23-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;w&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
