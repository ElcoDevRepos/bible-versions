The mention of Pharaoh's daughter highlights a connection between Israel and Egypt, reminiscent of Moses' upbringing in Pharaoh's household. Bithiah's integration into Israelite society through marriage to Mered suggests a blending of cultures and divine providence in Israel's history. Her children symbolize the merging of Egyptian and Israelite heritage, reflecting God's plan to incorporate diverse peoples into His covenant community.<p><b>Mered also took a Judean wife,</b><br>Mered's marriage to a Judean woman emphasizes the importance of tribal affiliations within Israel. The tribe of Judah holds particular significance as the lineage from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ would come. This marriage underscores the theme of unity and continuity within the tribes of Israel, as well as the fulfillment of God's promises through the line of Judah.<p><b>who gave birth to Jered the father of Gedor,</b><br>Jered is noted as the father of Gedor, a location mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. Gedor is associated with the territory of Judah, indicating the family's integration into the promised land. This connection to a specific place within Judah highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites a land of their own. It also underscores the importance of land inheritance and tribal identity in Israelite society.<p><b>Heber the father of Soco,</b><br>Heber is identified as the father of Soco, another location within Judah. Soco is mentioned in the context of battles and territorial boundaries in the Old Testament. This reference to Soco reinforces the theme of territorial inheritance and the establishment of Israelite identity in the land. It also serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggles and divine assistance in securing and maintaining the land promised to the descendants of Abraham.<p><b>and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah.</b><br>Jekuthiel is noted as the father of Zanoah, a town in the lowlands of Judah. Zanoah's mention in various biblical passages highlights its role in the post-exilic restoration efforts led by Nehemiah. This connection to restoration and rebuilding reflects the broader biblical theme of redemption and renewal. It also points to the faithfulness of God in restoring His people and fulfilling His promises, ultimately culminating in the coming of Jesus Christ, who brings spiritual restoration and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh's_daughter_bithiah.htm">Pharaoh&#8217;s Daughter Bithiah</a></b><br>A significant figure, Bithiah is noted for her marriage to Mered, an Israelite.

Clearly, therefore, the sentence "And these are the sons of Bithiah, the daughter of Pharaoh, which Mered took"--a sentence which is meaningless in its present position--must be restored to its original place after the first statement of <a href="/1_chronicles/4-17.htm" title="And the sons of Ezra were, Jether, and Mered, and Epher, and Jalon: and she bore Miriam, and Shammai, and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa.">1Chronicles 4:17</a>. We thus get the sense: "And the sons of Ezra were Jepher and Mered, and Epher and Jalon. And these [the following] are the sons of Bithiah, daughter of Pharaoh, whom Mered took [to wife]; she conceived Miriam and Shammai and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa. And his [Mered's] wife the Jewess bare Jered . . . Zanoah." Thus the house of Mered son of Ezra bifurcates into a purely Judaean and a mixed Egyptian group of families. Eshtemoa (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-17.htm" title="And the sons of Ezra were, Jether, and Mered, and Epher, and Jalon: and she bore Miriam, and Shammai, and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa.">1Chronicles 4:17</a>) lay south of Hebron, in the hil-country (<a href="/joshua/15-50.htm" title="And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,">Joshua 15:50</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Gedor.</span>--See <a href="/1_chronicles/4-4.htm" title="And Penuel the father of Gedor, and Ezer the father of Hushah.
