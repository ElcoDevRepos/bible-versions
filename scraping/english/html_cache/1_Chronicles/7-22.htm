The mourning mentioned here is due to the death of his sons, Ezer and Elead, who were killed by the men of Gath. This event highlights the ongoing conflicts between the Israelites and the Philistines, as Gath was a Philistine city. Mourning for many days indicates the depth of Ephraim's grief, reflecting the cultural practices of extended mourning periods in ancient Israel, which were common for significant losses. This mourning also underscores the importance of family and lineage in Israelite society, as Ephraim's descendants were meant to carry on his legacy.<p><b>and his relatives came to comfort him</b><br>The act of relatives coming to comfort Ephraim is consistent with the communal nature of ancient Israelite society, where family and kinship ties were strong. Comforting the bereaved was an important social and religious duty, as seen in other biblical accounts such as Job's friends coming to comfort him (<a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>). This practice is rooted in the understanding of shared grief and the support system provided by the community. It also reflects the biblical principle of bearing one another's burdens, as encouraged in <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>. The presence of relatives during mourning periods was a way to provide emotional support and to help the grieving process, emphasizing the value placed on family unity and compassion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>The son of Joseph and Asenath, Ephraim is one of the patriarchs of the tribes of Israel.

<a href="/numbers/1-32.htm">Numbers 1:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture records Ephraim&#8217;s earlier blessing by his grandfather Jacob&#8212;assurance that God&#8217;s promise still stands even when tragedy strikes (<a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>).<p>&#8226;

or if this be deemed too bold an interpretation of the archaic record, we have nothing for it but to suppose that the whole account relates to an expedition from Goshen, under two sons of Ephraim, during the lifetime of that patriarch;
