The Levites were descendants of Levi, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, and were set apart for religious duties. The mention of these names highlights the importance of lineage and the continuation of priestly duties as established in the Mosaic Law. Each name represents a family or clan within the tribe of Levi, emphasizing the organized structure of worship and service in ancient Israel.<p><b>were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God.</b><br>The blowing of trumpets was a significant act in Israelite worship and warfare, often signaling the presence of God or calling the people to attention. In this context, the trumpets announced the movement of the Ark of the Covenant, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The use of trumpets is rooted in the instructions given in <a href="/numbers/10.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>, where God commands Moses to make two silver trumpets for calling the community together and for having the camps set out. This act also foreshadows the eschatological trumpet calls mentioned in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>, where the trumpet will announce the return of Christ.<p><b>Obed-edom and Jehiah were also to be guardians of the ark.</b><br>Obed-edom is a significant figure, as the Ark of the Covenant had previously been kept at his house, bringing blessings upon his household (<a href="/2_samuel/6-11.htm">2 Samuel 6:11</a>). His role as a guardian underscores his faithfulness and the trust placed in him by King David. Jehiah, though less mentioned, shares in this responsibility, indicating the importance of safeguarding the Ark, which was the most sacred object in Israelite worship. The guardianship of the Ark reflects the reverence and care required in handling holy objects, a theme that resonates throughout the Old Testament, such as in the instructions for the tabernacle and temple service. This also points to the concept of stewardship and faithfulness in service to God, a principle that carries into New Testament teachings on spiritual responsibilities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shebaniah,_joshaphat,_nethanel,_amasai,_zechariah,_benaiah,_and_eliezer.htm">Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer</a></b><br>These were priests assigned to blow the trumpets before the ark of God.
