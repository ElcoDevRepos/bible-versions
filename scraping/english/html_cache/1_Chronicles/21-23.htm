His willingness to give his threshing floor to David reflects a recognition of David's authority and possibly a reverence for the God of Israel. This act of generosity is significant in the context of ancient Near Eastern customs, where hospitality and gift-giving were highly valued.<p><b>May my lord the king do whatever seems good to him.</b><br>Ornan's deference to David underscores the king's authority and the respect he commanded. This phrase highlights the cultural norm of showing honor to a king, which was a common practice in monarchies of the ancient world. It also reflects Ornan's submission to God's chosen leader, acknowledging David's role in the divine plan.<p><b>Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings,</b><br>The oxen were valuable assets, essential for agriculture and transportation. Offering them for burnt offerings signifies a sacrificial act of worship and atonement, as burnt offerings were meant to be wholly consumed by fire, symbolizing complete surrender to God. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself wholly for the atonement of sin.<p><b>the threshing sledges for the wood,</b><br>Threshing sledges were tools used to separate grain from chaff, made of wood and embedded with stones or metal. Offering them as wood for the sacrifice indicates Ornan's willingness to give up essential tools of his livelihood. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who gave up His life for humanity, providing the means for spiritual sustenance and purification.<p><b>and the wheat for the grain offering&#8212;</b><br>Wheat was a staple food and a symbol of sustenance and provision. The grain offering, or "minchah," was a tribute to God, often accompanying burnt offerings. It represents thanksgiving and dedication to God, paralleling the life of Christ, who is the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), sustaining believers spiritually.<p><b>I will give it all."</b><br>Ornan's complete offering reflects a heart of generosity and submission to God's will. This mirrors the call for believers to offer themselves wholly to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). It also prefigures the total sacrifice of Christ, who gave His all for the redemption of humanity. This act of giving without reservation is a model of faith and obedience, emphasizing the importance of sacrificial giving in worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who seeks to build an altar to the LORD to stop a plague on Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/ornan.htm">Ornan (Araunah)</a></b><br>A Jebusite who owns the threshing floor where David wishes to build the altar.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/threshing_floor.htm">Threshing Floor</a></b><br>The location where David intends to offer sacrifices to God, which later becomes the site of Solomon's Temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/plague.htm">Plague</a></b><br>A divine punishment on Israel due to David's census, which David seeks to end through sacrifice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offerings_and_grain_offerings.htm">Burnt Offerings and Grain Offerings</a></b><br>Sacrificial offerings to God, symbolizing atonement and dedication.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_and_willingness_to_give.htm">Generosity and Willingness to Give</a></b><br>Ornan's willingness to give everything needed for the sacrifice without cost reflects a heart of generosity and submission to God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_worship.htm">The Cost of Worship</a></b><br>David insists on paying for the threshing floor, teaching us that true worship often involves personal sacrifice and cost.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_repentance.htm">Obedience and Repentance</a></b><br>David's actions demonstrate the importance of obedience to God and repentance in the face of sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_mercy.htm">God's Sovereignty and Mercy</a></b><br>The cessation of the plague upon David's sacrifice illustrates God's control over events and His mercy in response to genuine repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_place.htm">The Significance of Place</a></b><br>The threshing floor of Ornan becomes the site of the future temple, showing how God can transform ordinary places into sites of divine significance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Chronicles_21_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Chronicles 21:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Chron_21_23_s_lesson_on_sacrificial_giving.htm">How does 1 Chronicles 21:23 demonstrate sacrificial giving in our lives today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Araunah_s_generosity.htm">What can we learn from Araunah's willingness to give freely to David?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_this_verse_to_Leviticus_offerings.htm">How does this verse connect to the concept of offerings in Leviticus?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_offer_God_costly_sacrifices.htm">Why is it important to offer God what costs us something?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Araunah_s_generosity_locally.htm">How can we apply Araunah's generosity in our community and church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_offer_free_threshing_floor_oxen.htm">Why did Araunah offer the threshing floor and oxen for free to King David?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Chronicles_21_23_on_sacrifices.htm">What does 1 Chronicles 21:23 reveal about sacrificial offerings in ancient Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Araunah_s_generosity_in_1_Chr_21_23.htm">How does Araunah's generosity in 1 Chronicles 21:23 reflect on his character?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_chronicles_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Chronicles 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_1_chronicles_23_stress_david's_new_levite_roles.htm">Why does 1 Chronicles 23 emphasize a new organizational structure under David, when some historical records suggest Levite roles evolved more gradually?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_incited_david's_census.htm">Who incited David to take a census?

As regards the <span class="accented">burnt offering</span>, see <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-8.htm">Leviticus 6:8-13</a>. It was called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, from its "ascending" accepted to heaven, or else from its being put up or raised up (Hiph. conjugation) on the altar; and sometimes <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>, from being "wholly" consumed. The sin and trespass offerings were for special sins, but this was of a more comprehensive kind and of much greater dignity, as standing for the "purging of the conscience." The entire consuming of the sacrifice signified the unqualified self-surrender of him who brought the sacrifice. It was a voluntary offering, the offerer laid his hand on the head of the victim, and the blood of the victim was sprinkled round about the altar. <span class="accented">The meat offering</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is fully described in Leviticus it.; Leviticus 6:14-23. It was an offering without blood, and therefore was an accompaniment of an offering of blood. It was composed of flour or cakes, prepared with salt, oil, and frank-incense - the salt emblematic of non-decay; the oil, of spiritual grace; and the frankincense, of acceptable fragrance. A portion of this offering was to be burnt, and a portion eaten by the priests in the court, unless it was for a priest himself, when all must be burnt. Meantime a drink offering of wine was, in fact, a part of the meat offering itself (<a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40, 41</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-13.htm">Leviticus 23:13</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-4.htm">Numbers 15:4-7, 9, 10</a>).
