It was originally called Kiriath Arba and is located in the hill country of Judah. Hebron holds significant importance as it was the place where Abraham settled and later purchased the cave of Machpelah as a burial site for his wife Sarah, and eventually for himself and other patriarchs. This city became a Levitical city, given to the descendants of Aaron, the priestly line, as part of their inheritance. The allocation of Hebron to the Levites underscores its spiritual significance, as it was a city of refuge and a center for religious activity. Hebron's connection to the patriarchs and its role as a Levitical city highlight its importance in Israel's religious and cultural history.<p><b>in the land of Judah</b><br>Judah was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, named after one of Jacob's sons. The tribe of Judah was known for its leadership and strength, and it played a central role in the history of Israel. The land of Judah was a fertile and strategically important region, encompassing Jerusalem, the future capital of Israel. The allocation of Hebron within Judah's territory to the Levites signifies the integration of religious and tribal leadership. Judah's prominence is further emphasized by its association with King David, who was anointed in Hebron and later established Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel. The tribe of Judah is also prophetically significant, as it is from this tribe that the Messiah, Jesus Christ, is prophesied to come, fulfilling the promise of a ruler from the line of David.<p><b>and its surrounding pasturelands</b><br>The mention of surrounding pasturelands indicates the practical provision for the Levites, who did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. Instead, they were given cities and surrounding lands to support their livestock and sustain their families. This arrangement allowed the Levites to focus on their priestly duties and service to the community. The pasturelands provided necessary resources for the Levites' livelihood, ensuring they could fulfill their religious responsibilities without the burden of agricultural labor. This provision reflects the communal and supportive structure of Israelite society, where the needs of the priestly class were met by the contributions of the other tribes. The allocation of pasturelands also underscores the importance of land and resources in the ancient Near Eastern context, where agriculture and livestock were central to survival and prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebron.htm">Hebron</a></b><br>A significant city in the land of Judah, Hebron is one of the oldest cities in the region and holds historical and spiritual importance.
