The role of gatekeepers was crucial in maintaining the sanctity and security of the temple, a task that required trustworthiness and dedication. The mention of his sons and brothers highlights the familial and communal nature of temple service, emphasizing the importance of lineage and heritage in the Levitical duties. This reflects the broader biblical theme of family and community in worship and service to God.<p><b>who were capable men</b><br>The term "capable men" indicates that Meshelemiah's family members were not only numerous but also competent and skilled in their duties. This capability would have included physical strength, integrity, and a deep understanding of their responsibilities. In the context of temple service, being capable also implies spiritual readiness and dedication to God&#8217;s work. This mirrors the biblical principle that God equips those He calls, as seen in other scriptures where God empowers individuals for specific tasks (e.g., <a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a> with Bezalel and Oholiab).<p><b>18 in all</b><br>The specific number, 18, underscores the significant contribution of Meshelemiah's family to the temple service. Numbers in the Bible often carry symbolic meaning, though here it primarily serves to quantify the strength and resources available for the temple's operation. This detail highlights the organized and structured nature of temple service, where each family had a defined role and responsibility. The emphasis on numbers also reflects the chronicler's interest in genealogies and the orderly administration of temple duties, as seen throughout the books of Chronicles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/meshelemiah.htm">Meshelemiah</a></b><br>A gatekeeper in the temple, part of the Levitical order, responsible for the security and order of the temple.
