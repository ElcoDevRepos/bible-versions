The number 956 indicates a specific count of individuals, emphasizing the precision and care taken in these records. Genealogies were vital for determining land inheritance, priestly duties, and tribal affiliations. This meticulous record-keeping reflects the broader biblical theme of God's order and structure within His chosen people. The mention of "relatives" underscores the communal and familial nature of Israelite society, where family ties were central to social and religious life. This also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's covenant with Abraham, promising numerous descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>).<p><b>All these men were heads of their families.</b><br>Being a "head of a family" in ancient Israel carried significant responsibility, both spiritually and socially. These men were leaders within their clans, responsible for the welfare and spiritual guidance of their households. This role is consistent with the patriarchal structure of Israelite society, where family heads acted as representatives in religious and civic matters. The emphasis on leadership within the family unit reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and accountability before God. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where spiritual leadership within the family is also emphasized (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4-5</a>). The role of family heads can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate head of the Church, guiding and nurturing His people (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The verse refers to the Israelites who returned to Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.

Jesus later reinforces this heart for individuals when He speaks of knowing the exact number of hairs on our heads (<a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The large figure also highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness to preserve His people after exile, echoing His promise in <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a> that He had &#8220;plans to prosper&#8221; them even in difficult seasons.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to their genealogy</b><p>&#8226; Genealogies were carefully kept to verify tribal identity, inheritance rights, and covenant promises.
