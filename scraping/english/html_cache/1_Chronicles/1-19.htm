His lineage is crucial as it connects to the line of Shem, one of Noah's sons, and ultimately to Abraham, the patriarch of Israel. The mention of Eber's sons highlights the continuation of the Semitic line, which is central to the biblical narrative.<p><b>One was named Peleg:</b><br>The name Peleg means "division" or "split," which is significant in the context of the biblical narrative. Peleg's name is a direct reference to a major event during his lifetime, which is further explained in the following phrase. This naming convention reflects the ancient practice of naming children after significant events or characteristics.<p><b>because in his days the earth was divided:</b><br>This phrase is often interpreted as referring to the division of the peoples and languages at the Tower of Babel, as described in <a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>. The division could also imply a geographical or political separation. The event marks a pivotal moment in human history, where God intervened to scatter humanity across the earth, leading to the formation of different nations and cultures.<p><b>and his brother was named Joktan:</b><br>Joktan is the ancestor of several Arabian tribes, as listed in <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>. His descendants are associated with the regions in the southern Arabian Peninsula. The mention of Joktan alongside Peleg emphasizes the branching out of human families and the spread of different peoples across the earth.

Peleg&#8217;s name memorializes that division, while Joktan&#8217;s lineage shows the continued spread of families across the earth. The verse affirms God&#8217;s active rule over history, His establishment of national boundaries, and His guidance of specific families&#8212;ultimately steering one branch toward the promised Savior, fulfilling His redemptive plan for all peoples.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/1-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And two</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - mdc<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8147.htm">Strong's 8147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two (a cardinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were born</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(yul&#183;la&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - QalPass - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3205.htm">Strong's 3205: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bear young, to beget, medically, to act as midwife, to show lineage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Eber:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1445;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;&#7687;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124;
