The Egyptian's height, approximately 7.5 feet (2.3 meters), emphasizes the formidable nature of the opponent. Such a description recalls the account of Goliath, another giant faced by David himself, drawing a parallel between David's and Benaiah's courage and faith. The mention of an Egyptian may also symbolize a foreign threat, as Egypt was historically an adversary of Israel. This victory over a giant foreigner underscores God's empowerment of His people to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.<p><b>Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver&#8217;s beam in his hand,</b><br>The comparison of the spear to a weaver's beam suggests its massive size and weight, similar to the description of Goliath's spear in <a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>. This detail emphasizes the Egyptian's strength and the daunting challenge Benaiah faced. The weaver's beam, a large and sturdy piece of equipment, signifies the advanced weaponry and military prowess of the Egyptian, making Benaiah's victory even more impressive. This imagery serves to highlight the theme of God enabling His chosen servants to triumph over powerful adversaries.<p><b>Benaiah went against him with a club,</b><br>Benaiah's choice of a club, a seemingly inferior weapon compared to the spear, illustrates his bravery and resourcefulness. This scenario echoes the biblical theme of God using the weak or humble to confound the strong, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>. Benaiah's willingness to confront the Egyptian with a less formidable weapon demonstrates his reliance on God's strength rather than human might. This act of faith and courage is reminiscent of David's confrontation with Goliath, where faith in God was the true weapon.<p><b>snatched the spear from his hand,</b><br>This action signifies Benaiah's skill and agility in combat, as well as his ability to turn the enemy's strength against him. The act of disarming the Egyptian highlights the theme of divine intervention and wisdom granted to God's servants. It also reflects the biblical principle that God can transform the tools of the enemy into instruments of victory for His people, as seen in the story of David and Goliath, where David used Goliath's own sword to defeat him.<p><b>and killed the Egyptian with his own spear.</b><br>The conclusion of this encounter demonstrates the complete reversal of power, where the weapon intended to harm becomes the means of deliverance. This mirrors the biblical motif of God turning the plans of the wicked against themselves, as seen in the story of Haman in the Book of Esther. Benaiah's victory serves as a testament to God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises to protect and empower His people. This act also prefigures the ultimate victory of Jesus Christ, who, through His death and resurrection, defeated sin and death using the very instrument of His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benaiah.htm">Benaiah</a></b><br>A valiant warrior from Kabzeel, known for his bravery and loyalty to King David.
