The timing emphasizes the swift consequences of the battle and the urgency with which the Philistines acted. In the ancient Near East, battles often concluded with the victors quickly scavenging the battlefield.<p><b>when the Philistines came to strip the dead</b><br>Stripping the dead was a common practice in ancient warfare, where the victors would take armor, weapons, and valuables from the fallen. This act not only provided material gain but also served as a symbolic gesture of dominance over the defeated. The Philistines, long-time enemies of Israel, sought to humiliate the Israelites further by desecrating their dead.<p><b>they found Saul and his sons</b><br>Saul, the first king of Israel, and his sons, including Jonathan, were found among the dead. This discovery was significant as it marked the end of Saul's reign and the beginning of a new chapter in Israel's history. Saul's death fulfilled the prophecy given by Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>, where it was foretold that Saul and his sons would die in battle.<p><b>fallen on Mount Gilboa</b><br>Mount Gilboa is a mountain range in northern Israel, significant for its strategic location. The battle's location highlights the Philistines' incursion into Israelite territory. The fall of Saul and his sons on this mountain symbolizes the defeat and humiliation of Israel. The site later became a place of mourning and lamentation, as seen in David's lament in <a href="/2_samuel/1-21.htm">2 Samuel 1:21</a>, where he curses the mountains for the tragedy that occurred there.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant enemy of Israel throughout the Old Testament, known for their conflicts with the Israelites.
