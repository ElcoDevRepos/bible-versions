He is addressing the assembly of Israel, including the leaders and his son Solomon. This moment is significant as David is passing on the plans for the temple, which he was not permitted to build due to being a man of war (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm">1 Chronicles 28:3</a>). David's role as a king and prophet is highlighted, as he communicates God's will to the people.<p><b>&#8220;all the details of this plan,&#8221;</b><br>The "plan" refers to the detailed blueprint for the construction of the temple, which David had prepared for Solomon. This plan included the temple's structure, its furnishings, and the organization of the priesthood and Levites. The specificity of the plan underscores the importance of the temple as a central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. It reflects the meticulous nature of God's instructions, similar to the detailed plans given to Moses for the tabernacle (Exodus 25-31).<p><b>the LORD has made clear to me</b><br>David attributes the source of the plan to divine revelation. This emphasizes the belief that God is actively involved in the affairs of His people and provides guidance for their spiritual and communal life. It also reinforces the idea that the temple is not merely a human endeavor but a divinely ordained project. This divine involvement is consistent with other instances in Scripture where God provides specific instructions, such as the building of Noah's ark (<a href="/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14-16</a>).<p><b>in writing by His hand upon me.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase suggests a supernatural communication, where God directly imparts the plans to David. This could be understood as a form of divine inspiration or revelation, akin to the way prophets received messages from God. The imagery of God's "hand" signifies His power and authority, as well as His personal involvement in the transmission of His will. This concept of divine writing is reminiscent of the tablets of the Law given to Moses, written by the finger of God (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). It underscores the sacredness and authority of the temple plans, as they are not merely human ideas but divinely sanctioned instructions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is speaking in this verse.

The omission of any introductory formula, such as "And David said," is dramatic. (Comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/16-8.htm" title="Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name, make known his deeds among the people.">1Chronicles 16:8</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/23-4.htm" title="Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:">1Chronicles 23:4-5</a>.) Literally rendered, after the Hebrew punctuation, the verse runs:--"The whole in a writing from the hand of Jehovah, to me he made clear; all the works of the model." With the expression "a writing from the hand of Jehovah" (comp. <a href="/exodus/31-18.htm" title="And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm" title="And look that you make them after their pattern, which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 25:40</a>), David affirms his "pattern" of the sanctuary and its vessels to have been conceived, and described in writing, under that Divine guidance which he sought and followed in all the great enterprises of his life. Whether "the writing" was a communication "by the hand of" one of David's seers, or merely the description of the Mosaic sanctuary (Exodus 25 <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> is not clear. The verb "he taught" (<span class= "ital">hiskil</span>) requires an object, such as is supplied in the Authorised version: "made me understand." It takes a dative (<a href="/proverbs/21-11.htm" title="When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.">Proverbs 21:11</a>), and probably the word rendered "upon me" is really a later equivalent of the same construction. Else we might compare <a href="/nehemiah/2-8.htm" title="And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God on me.">Nehemiah 2:8</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm" title="The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there on him.">Ezekiel 1:3</a>, and render: "The whole, in a writing from the hand of Jehovah upon me, he taught," implying that David himself sketched out the whole design under Divine inspiration.
