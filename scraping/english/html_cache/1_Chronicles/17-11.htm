In biblical terms, the fulfillment of days often signifies the natural end of a person's life, suggesting a divine timing. It reflects the understanding that God has a sovereign plan for each life, as seen in <a href="/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>, where the days of a person are determined by God.<p><b>and you go to be with your fathers</b><br>This expression is a common biblical euphemism for death, implying a reunion with ancestors in the afterlife. It reflects the Hebrew understanding of Sheol, the abode of the dead, where the patriarchs were believed to reside. This phrase underscores the continuity of God's covenantal promises through generations, as seen in <a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a> with Abraham.<p><b>I will raise up your descendant after you</b><br>This promise is a direct reference to the Davidic Covenant, where God assures David that his lineage will continue. The term "raise up" suggests divine intervention and support, indicating that this descendant will be chosen and empowered by God. This is echoed in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>, reinforcing the idea of a divinely ordained succession.<p><b>one of your own sons</b><br>This specifies that the successor will be a biological descendant of David, emphasizing the importance of bloodline in the fulfillment of God's promises. Solomon, David's son, is the immediate fulfillment of this prophecy, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/1-30.htm">1 Kings 1:30</a>. However, it also points to the Messianic lineage culminating in Jesus Christ, as outlined in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>.<p><b>and I will establish his kingdom</b><br>This phrase indicates a divine guarantee of stability and longevity for the kingdom. The establishment of the kingdom is not merely political but also spiritual, as it foreshadows the eternal kingdom of Christ. The promise of an everlasting kingdom is further elaborated in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a> and finds ultimate fulfillment in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>, where Jesus is declared to reign over the house of Jacob forever.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel to whom God is speaking through the prophet Nathan.
