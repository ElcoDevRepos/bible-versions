He is prominently featured in the Book of Ruth, where he is depicted as a kinsman-redeemer, a type of Christ. The role of a kinsman-redeemer was to protect the interests of needy family members, which Boaz fulfills by marrying Ruth, a Moabite widow, and thus preserving the family line. This act of redemption is a foreshadowing of Christ's redemptive work for humanity. Boaz's actions demonstrate the importance of faithfulness and obedience to God's laws, as well as the inclusion of Gentiles into God's covenant community, as Ruth was not an Israelite by birth.<p><b>and Obed was the father of Jesse</b><br>Obed, the son of Boaz and Ruth, continues the lineage that leads to King David. His name means "servant" or "worshiper," reflecting the role of his descendants in serving God and leading His people. Obed's birth is a testament to God's providence and the fulfillment of His promises, as it ensures the continuation of the line that would bring forth the Messiah. The inclusion of Ruth, a Moabite, in this lineage highlights God's grace and the breaking down of ethnic barriers, pointing to the universal scope of the gospel.<p><b>and Obed was the father of Jesse</b><br>Jesse, the father of David, is a pivotal figure in the history of Israel. He is from Bethlehem, a town that holds significant prophetic importance as the birthplace of Jesus (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). Jesse's role as the father of David places him in the direct line of the Messiah, fulfilling the prophecy that the Savior would come from the house of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Jesse's family is a symbol of God's sovereign choice, as David, the youngest and seemingly least likely of his sons, is chosen by God to be king. This choice underscores the biblical theme that God often uses the humble and unexpected to accomplish His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>Boaz is a significant figure in the lineage of David and Jesus Christ.
