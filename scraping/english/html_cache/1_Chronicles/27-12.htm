The ninth division served during the ninth month, indicating a structured and orderly approach to military service. This reflects the administrative skills of David's reign and the importance of preparedness and organization in leadership.<p><b>was Abiezer the Anathothite</b><br>Abiezer is identified as the leader of this division. Anathoth was a town in the territory of Benjamin, located a few miles northeast of Jerusalem. It is notable as the hometown of the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). The mention of Anathoth highlights the geographical diversity within the tribes of Israel and the interconnectedness of various biblical figures and locations.<p><b>a Benjamite</b><br>The tribe of Benjamin was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for its warriors and strategic location near Jerusalem. Benjamin's territory was small but significant, often playing a crucial role in Israel's history. The tribe's association with King Saul, Israel's first king, adds historical depth to the mention of a Benjamite leader in David's army.<p><b>There were 24,000 men in his division</b><br>Each division in David's military structure consisted of 24,000 men, indicating a well-organized and substantial force. This number reflects the strength and capability of Israel's army during David's reign. The organization into divisions allowed for efficient management and readiness, ensuring that Israel was prepared for both defense and conquest. The number 24,000 also symbolizes completeness and order, aligning with the biblical theme of God's provision and protection for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abiezer.htm">Abiezer</a></b><br>A leader of the ninth division of King David's army, hailing from Anathoth, a town in the territory of Benjamin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/anathoth.htm">Anathoth</a></b><br>A town in the tribal territory of Benjamin, known for being the hometown of the prophet Jeremiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamite.htm">Benjamite</a></b><br>Refers to a member of the tribe of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_army_divisions.htm">David's Army Divisions</a></b><br>King David organized his army into divisions, each led by a commander and serving on a rotating basis throughout the year.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/2/24,000_soldiers.htm">24,000 Soldiers</a></b><br>The number of soldiers in each division, indicating the organized and substantial military force under King David's rule.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_organization.htm">Leadership and Organization</a></b><br>David's structured military divisions reflect the importance of organization and leadership in achieving collective goals.

By fixing the order, the king ensured fairness and predictability&#8212;every commander and soldier knew exactly when his service began, much like the priestly courses later arranged by David&#8217;s son Solomon (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/24-1.htm">1 Chronicles 24:1&#8211;19</a>; <a href="/luke/1-5.htm">Luke 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the ninth month</b><p>Each division served for one calendar month, so Abiezer&#8217;s men were on duty during the ninth month of Israel&#8217;s civil year. This rotation preserved national security without overburdening the populace&#8212;only one month of active duty per year (compare <a href="/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>&#8217;s monthly provision officers and <a href="/2_chronicles/17-14.htm">2 Chronicles 17:14-19</a>&#8217;s ready reserves). The structure highlights God&#8217;s concern for order and rest, echoing rhythms He built into creation itself (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was Abiezer the Anathothite</b><p>Abiezer appears earlier among David&#8217;s &#8220;thirty&#8221; mighty warriors (<a href="/2_samuel/23-27.htm">2 Samuel 23:27</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-28.htm">1 Chronicles 11:28</a>). His hometown, Anathoth, lay just north of Jerusalem and was a priestly city (<a href="/joshua/21-18.htm">Joshua 21:18</a>). That background suggests Abiezer was raised amid Levitical teaching, yet God called him to military leadership&#8212;proof that faithful service can take many forms (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a> for another notable son of Anathoth).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A Benjamite</b><p>Anathoth belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. Benjamin once aligned with Saul, but many Benjamites transferred loyalty to David (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-1.htm">1 Chronicles 12:1-7, 29</a>). By highlighting Abiezer&#8217;s tribal identity, the text underscores the unity God forged among previously divided clans (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>). It also showcases David&#8217;s inclusiveness&#8212;merit, not birth order, determined command (cf. <a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There were 24,000 men in his division</b><p>Every monthly shift numbered 24,000, producing an annual force of 288,000 elite troops (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1</a>). This sizeable yet scalable army balanced national defense with agricultural productivity; men spent most of the year at home but could mobilize instantly (<a href="/nehemiah/4-17.htm">Nehemiah 4:17-18</a> captures the same work-and-watch principle). The figure also mirrors the 24,000 Levites appointed for temple service (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-4.htm">1 Chronicles 23:4</a>), hinting that both worship and warfare were acts of covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/27-12.htm">1 Chronicles 27:12</a> records the ninth of twelve monthly military rotations under David. Abiezer&#8212;an accomplished warrior from the priestly town of Anathoth in Benjamin&#8212;commanded 24,000 men during the ninth month. The verse showcases God-given order, unity among Israel&#8217;s tribes, and a system that combined national security with personal livelihood, all under the righteous rule of the king after God&#8217;s own heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - For <span class="cmt_word">Abiezer</span>, of the tribe of Benjamin, see <a href="/1_chronicles/11-28.htm">1 Chronicles 11:28</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/23-27.htm">2 Samuel 23:27</a>.
