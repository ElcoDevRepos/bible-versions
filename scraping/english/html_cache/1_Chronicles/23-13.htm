Aaron was the first high priest, and Moses was the leader who brought the Israelites out of Egypt. Their lineage is significant as it establishes the priestly and prophetic lines in Israel. This connection is crucial for understanding the Levitical priesthood and the prophetic tradition in Israel.<p><b>Aaron and his descendants were set apart forever</b><br>Aaron and his descendants were chosen by God to serve as priests, a role that was to be perpetual. This setting apart signifies a divine election and a covenantal relationship with God. The priesthood was not just a temporary assignment but an eternal ordinance, emphasizing the importance of holiness and dedication to God's service.<p><b>to consecrate the most holy things</b><br>The priests were responsible for maintaining the sanctity of the tabernacle and later the temple. This included the consecration of sacred objects used in worship. The concept of consecration underscores the need for purity and reverence in approaching God, reflecting the holiness required of those who serve Him.<p><b>to burn incense before the LORD</b><br>Burning incense was a priestly duty that symbolized the prayers of the people ascending to God. It was performed in the Holy Place, signifying the intercessory role of the priests. This act is a type of Christ, who intercedes for believers before the Father, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>.<p><b>to minister before Him</b><br>The priests served in the presence of God, performing rituals and sacrifices on behalf of the people. This ministry was a constant reminder of the need for mediation between a holy God and sinful humanity. It foreshadows the ultimate ministry of Jesus Christ, who serves as the perfect mediator.<p><b>and to pronounce blessings in His name forever.</b><br>The priestly blessing, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, was a powerful declaration of God's favor and peace upon the people. This role of pronouncing blessings highlights the authority given to the priests and the importance of invoking God's name.

By naming Amram first, the Chronicler reminds us that God&#8217;s purposes often begin in the ordinary setting of family life. The verse&#8217;s opening signals continuity with earlier revelation: &#8220;God is not a man, that He should lie&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).

Though individual priests could fail (<a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27-34</a>), the office itself remained &#8220;forever,&#8221; pointing ultimately to Jesus, the final High Priest &#8220;according to the order of Melchizedek&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To consecrate the most holy things</b><p>Only Aaronic priests handled the sacred vessels, furniture, and offerings inside the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15-16</a>). <a href="/bsb/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a> shows the seriousness of approaching the &#8220;Most Holy Place.&#8221; Their task was not mere ritual; it proclaimed God&#8217;s holiness and mankind&#8217;s need for atonement.

Only authorized priests could offer it; Nadab and Abihu&#8217;s unauthorized fire (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>) warns against casual worship.

The tribe obviously includes the Aaronite clan. (Comp. also <a href="/deuteronomy/21-5.htm" title="And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD your God has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And to bless in his name.</span>--This appears right from <a href="/numbers/6-23.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, On this wise you shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them,">Numbers 6:23</a>.

From Amram, the first-mentioned son of Kohath, come the two great names of <span class="cmt_word">Aaron and Moses</span> (<a href="/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Aaron was separated,... and his sons for ever</span>. This statement must be read, both with ver. 3 - into the number of Levites mentioned in which Aaron and his sons do not count - and with ver. 14, which implies that Moses and his sons did count into that number. The sons of Aaron are dealt with in <a href="/1_chronicles/24-1.htm">1 Chronicles 24:1-19</a>, <span class="accented">infra. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That he should sanctify the most holy things</span>. The Hebrew text renders it doubtful whether the rendering here should not rather be, "Aaron was separated to sanctify <span class="accented">him</span> as most holy," etc. If it be so, this is the only place where the forcible term, "holy of holies" (most holy), is used of Aaron. The duties of the priest are described as threefold, in this place, viz.: "to burn incense before the Lord," - this will carry the idea of making atonement; "to minister to God," on behalf of man, ? this will be one part of the work of a mediator; and "to bless in the Name of God," - this will fulfil the remaining part. For <span class="accented">ever.</span> The proviso may, no doubt, include reference to the "ever-living High Priest."
