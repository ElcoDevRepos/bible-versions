It reflects the passing of responsibility and blessing from one generation to the next. In the biblical context, the father-son relationship is significant, often symbolizing the transfer of wisdom and divine promises. David's role as a father is not only biological but also spiritual, guiding Solomon in the ways of the Lord.<p><b>may the LORD be with you</b><br>This is a blessing and a prayer for divine presence and guidance. The presence of the Lord is crucial for success and prosperity, as seen throughout the Old Testament. The phrase echoes the covenantal promise God made to be with His people, as seen in <a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a> and <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>. It underscores the belief that human efforts are futile without God's presence.<p><b>and may you succeed in building the house of the LORD your God</b><br>David expresses his desire for Solomon to fulfill the divine mandate of constructing the temple, a task David himself was not permitted to complete (<a href="/1_chronicles/17-4.htm">1 Chronicles 17:4</a>). The temple is not just a physical structure but a symbol of God's dwelling among His people. The success of this endeavor is tied to obedience and faithfulness to God's commands, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/2-3.htm">1 Kings 2:3-4</a>.<p><b>as He said you would</b><br>This phrase refers to the divine promise and prophecy given to David regarding Solomon's role in building the temple (<a href="/1_chronicles/17-11.htm">1 Chronicles 17:11-12</a>). It highlights the fulfillment of God's word and the importance of divine sovereignty in the unfolding of biblical history. This assurance of God's promise is a recurring theme, emphasizing that God's plans are certain and will come to pass, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is speaking to his son Solomon, giving him a charge to build the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David, chosen to build the temple of the LORD.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who has given the command and promise regarding the building of the temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple is to be built, significant as the spiritual and political center of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_presence_and_success.htm">Divine Presence and Success</a></b><br>Success in any endeavor, especially spiritual ones, requires the presence and blessing of the LORD.
