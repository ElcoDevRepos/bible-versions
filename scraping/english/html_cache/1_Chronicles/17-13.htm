The father-son relationship signifies a special bond and divine favor. In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings were often seen as sons of gods, but here, the relationship is personal and covenantal, not mythological. This promise is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>, where it is applied to Jesus, highlighting His divine sonship and messianic kingship. The Davidic Covenant, of which this is a part, is foundational for understanding the messianic expectations fulfilled in Christ.<p><b>And I will never remove My loving devotion from him</b><br>This assurance of steadfast love, or "chesed" in Hebrew, indicates God's enduring commitment to Solomon and his lineage. It contrasts with the conditional nature of human loyalty and reflects God's covenant faithfulness. This promise is significant in the context of Israel's history, where kings often failed to uphold God's statutes. The term "loving devotion" is central to understanding God's character throughout the Old Testament, emphasizing His mercy and faithfulness. This promise finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus, whose kingdom is eternal and unshakeable, as seen in <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>.<p><b>as I removed it from your predecessor.</b><br>The reference to "your predecessor" points to King Saul, whose reign was marked by disobedience and eventual rejection by God (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26-28</a>). Saul's removal serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of failing to follow God's commands. This historical context underscores the gravity of divine favor and the importance of covenant fidelity. The contrast between Saul and David's line highlights the theme of divine election and grace, which is further developed in the New Testament with the concept of being chosen in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel to whom God is speaking through the prophet Nathan.

After these words, Samuel adds: "If he commit iniquity I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men." The omission is probably not a mere abridgment. The reference in this prophecy looks beyond Solomon to Him of whom the greatest princes of the house of David were but imperfect types. The warning here omitted was amply fulfilled in the history of Solomon and his successors but it could not apply to the true Anointed of Jehovah, and is therefore suppressed as a transitory element in the prophecy.<p><span class= "bld">And I will not take my mercy away</span>.--Samuel, "and my mercy shall not depart"--the same verb in a different form.
