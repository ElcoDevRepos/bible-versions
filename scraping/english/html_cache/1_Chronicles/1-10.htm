This places Nimrod in the post-flood genealogical line, which is significant for understanding the spread of nations and peoples after the flood. Cush's descendants are traditionally associated with regions in Africa, particularly Ethiopia, which is sometimes referred to as Cush in the Bible. Nimrod, as a descendant of Cush, is thus linked to the early post-diluvian world and the spread of civilization.<p><b>who began to be a mighty one on the earth</b><br>Nimrod is described as a "mighty one," which suggests not only physical strength but also a position of power and influence. This phrase indicates the beginning of his rise to prominence. Nimrod is often associated with the founding of some of the earliest cities and civilizations, such as Babylon and Nineveh, which are significant in biblical history. His might is not just in terms of physical prowess but also in leadership and possibly in establishing the first known empire. This description of Nimrod as a "mighty one" can be seen as a precursor to later biblical figures who wielded significant power, and it sets the stage for the development of kingdoms and empires that play crucial roles in biblical narratives. Nimrod's legacy is complex, as he is sometimes viewed as a rebellious figure against God, which can be seen as a type of antichrist figure, contrasting with the ultimate reign of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cush.htm">Cush</a></b><br>A descendant of Noah through Ham, Cush is often associated with the region of Ethiopia or Nubia.
