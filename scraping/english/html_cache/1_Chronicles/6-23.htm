This Elkanah is part of the priestly line, which is crucial for understanding the hereditary nature of the Levitical priesthood. The name Elkanah means "God has possessed" or "God has created," reflecting the divine calling and purpose in his life. Elkanah is also the name of Samuel's father, though this is a different Elkanah. The repetition of this name in the Levitical genealogy underscores the importance of maintaining a pure and dedicated priestly line, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>.<p><b>Ebiasaph his son</b><br>Ebiasaph, meaning "the father has gathered," is another link in the Levitical chain. He is a descendant of Korah, who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron (Numbers 16). Despite Korah's rebellion, his descendants were preserved and continued to serve in the temple, showing God's grace and the restoration of a family line to its intended purpose. Ebiasaph's inclusion in the genealogy highlights the continuity of the priestly duties and the importance of family heritage in maintaining the worship practices of Israel.<p><b>Assir his son</b><br>Assir, meaning "captive" or "prisoner," is a name that may reflect the experiences of the Israelites during times of captivity or oppression. The name could symbolize the trials faced by the Levitical line, yet their continued faithfulness to their calling. Assir's place in the genealogy serves as a reminder of the resilience and perseverance required to maintain one's faith and duties amidst adversity. This resilience is echoed in the broader narrative of Israel's history, where periods of captivity often led to spiritual renewal and a return to covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elkanah.htm">Elkanah</a></b><br>A descendant of Levi, Elkanah is part of the Levitical lineage, which is significant for the priestly duties in Israel.

By the time we reach &#8220;Elkanah his son,&#8221; the text is following the line of Korah (compare <a href="/exodus/6-24.htm">Exodus 6:24</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-10.htm">Numbers 26:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Elkanah marks God&#8217;s preservation of the family that once rebelled under Korah yet was spared for future service. This thread later blossoms in another Elkanah from the same clan&#8212;the father of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>), reminding us that God redeems family stories for His purposes.<p>&#8226; Every name in the genealogy is a testimony that God keeps covenant promises to Levi (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; The flow of fathers and sons underscores that spiritual heritage is transmitted generationally, not left to chance (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ebiasaph his son</b><p>&#8226; The name moves the line one generation forward, showing continuity rather than a break. Scripture presents no anecdotal stories about Ebiasaph, yet his place matters: God counts people we never hear sermons about (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The chronicler&#8217;s readers&#8212;post-exilic Levites restoring temple worship&#8212;would see Ebiasaph as proof that their pedigree was intact and their ministry valid (<a href="/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s record-keeping assures believers today that our unseen faithfulness is remembered (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Assir his son</b><p>&#8226; This is the second Assir in the passage (the first appears in v. 22). The repetition bookends the paragraph, highlighting the unbroken chain from Korah to the later temple musicians called &#8220;sons of Korah&#8221; (<a href="/bsb/psalms/84.htm">Psalm 84</a> title).<p>&#8226; Naming another Assir reinforces the idea that God can restart a legacy even after rebellion; the line that once staged a mutiny (<a href="/bsb/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>) now supplies worship leaders (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-19.htm">2 Chronicles 20:19</a>).<p>&#8226; For the chronicler, the final Assir signals arrival at the contemporary generation, connecting ancient promise with present calling&#8212;just as believers today trace their spiritual lineage to Christ and are urged to walk worthy of it (<a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-23.htm">1 Chronicles 6:23</a> is more than a list of bygone names. Each link&#8212;Elkanah, Ebiasaph, Assir&#8212;testifies that God preserves, records, and redeems families for His service. The verse assures us that faithfulness is remembered across generations and that, in Christ, our own names are written into His continuing story.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/6-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Elkanah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el&#183;q&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_511.htm">Strong's 511: </a> </span><span class="str2">Elkanah -- 'God has created', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his son,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
