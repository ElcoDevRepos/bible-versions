Shimei is listed as the leader of the tenth division of musicians. This reflects the structured and orderly worship that was central to Israelite religious life. The number ten often symbolizes completeness in the Bible, suggesting Shimei's group was a complete unit within the larger assembly of musicians. Shimei, a name meaning "heard," may remind readers of the importance of listening to God's word and worshiping Him through music.<p><b>his sons, and his brothers</b><br>This phrase highlights the familial nature of the Levitical service. The inclusion of sons and brothers indicates that musical service was a family affair, passed down through generations. This reflects the broader biblical theme of faith and service being a family responsibility, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to teach God's commandments to their children. It also underscores the communal aspect of worship, where families served together in the temple.<p><b>12 in all</b><br>The number twelve is significant throughout the Bible, often representing God's people, as seen in the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles. In this context, the number twelve may symbolize completeness and divine order in worship. It suggests that Shimei's group was fully equipped to fulfill their role in the temple service. This number also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's people being organized and unified in their worship and service to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shimei.htm">Shimei</a></b><br>A leader of one of the divisions of musicians appointed by King David for the service of the house of the Lord.

The numerical order mattered; it guaranteed that every family, regardless of status, served at a set, fair time (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/24-31.htm">1 Chronicles 24:31</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p>- The Spirit-led lot underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty over worship schedules, assuring us that even routine rotations come under His loving direction (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Shimei</b><p>- Shimei is listed among Heman&#8217;s sons (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-4.htm">1 Chronicles 25:4</a>), linking him to a prophetic, musical lineage appointed by King David (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>).<p>- His name attached to the tenth lot signals personal responsibility; leadership in worship was entrusted to identifiable individuals, not anonymous groups (cf. <a href="/ezra/2-41.htm">Ezra 2:41</a>).<p>- God honors and records specific servants, reminding us that He sees every act of worship, whether public or unnoticed (<a href="/matthew/6-4.htm">Matthew 6:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his sons</b><p>- Family participation is emphasized repeatedly in this chapter (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-5.htm">1 Chronicles 25:5&#8211;6</a>). Sons served alongside their fathers, learning skill and devotion by example (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>- This pattern affirms the generational transmission of faith: fathers mentoring children in praise prepares the whole community for robust, continuous worship (<a href="/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a>).<p>- It encourages households today to cultivate shared worship experiences, safeguarding praise from becoming a &#8220;professional only&#8221; activity (<a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his brothers&#8212;12 in all</b><p>- &#8220;Brothers&#8221; likely refers to extended male relatives within Shimei&#8217;s clan, indicating teamwork beyond the immediate household (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-7.htm">1 Chronicles 25:7</a>).<p>- &#8220;12 in all&#8221; echoes the standardized number assigned to every lot in the chapter (vv. 9&#8211;31). Twelve repeatedly symbolizes completeness in Scripture (<a href="/genesis/49-28.htm">Genesis 49:28</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12</a>).<p>- The fixed group size ensured balanced musical coverage each week (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/23-30.htm">1 Chronicles 23:30&#8211;31</a>). It also teaches that worship involves coordinated bodies of believers, not isolated individuals (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/25-17.htm">1 Chronicles 25:17</a> records that the tenth divinely chosen rotation of temple musicians fell to Shimei. He, his sons, and his extended family&#8212;twelve men in total&#8212;were slated to lead praise during their appointed time. The verse highlights God&#8217;s orderly governance of worship, personal accountability in service, the importance of family involvement, and the completeness of each worship team. Together these truths invite believers to honor God&#8217;s precise order, involve our households in praise, and serve joyfully in the roles He assigns.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Shimei.</span>--Omitted by accident from <a href="/1_chronicles/25-3.htm" title="Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun;
