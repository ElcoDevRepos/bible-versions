This highlights his importance in the genealogical record of the tribe. Gibeon was a prominent city, known for its strategic location and its role in various biblical events, such as the Gibeonite deception in <a href="/joshua/9.htm">Joshua 9</a>. Jeiel's mention here underscores the continuity of Israel's tribal heritage and the importance of family lineage in maintaining tribal identity.<p><b>lived in Gibeon</b><br>Gibeon was located northwest of Jerusalem and played a crucial role in Israel's history. It was a Levitical city and a city of refuge, indicating its religious and judicial significance. The city's location made it a key site for trade and military strategy. Archaeological findings, such as the large water system, attest to its historical importance. The mention of Jeiel living in Gibeon emphasizes the rootedness of his family in this influential city.<p><b>His wife&#8217;s name was Maacah</b><br>Maacah is a name that appears several times in the Old Testament, often associated with royal or noble families. The inclusion of her name in the genealogy suggests her significance, possibly indicating her own noble lineage or her role in the family's status. In biblical genealogies, the mention of a wife often highlights her importance in the continuation of the family line or her influence within the family. This reflects the cultural context where family alliances and heritage were crucial for social and political standing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeiel.htm">Jeiel</a></b><br>Identified as the father of Gibeon, Jeiel is a patriarchal figure whose lineage is significant in the genealogical records of the tribe of Benjamin.

The same emphasis appears in <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1&#8211;17</a>, where a lineage anchors Jesus in history.<p>&#8226; By naming Jeiel, the text reminds readers that every family matters to God, echoing <a href="/isaiah/49-16.htm">Isaiah 49:16</a>: &#8220;Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lived in Gibeon</b><p>&#8226; Gibeon was a prominent city in Benjamin&#8217;s territory (<a href="/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a>), famous for the Gibeonite treaty (<a href="/bsb/joshua/9.htm">Joshua 9</a>) and Joshua&#8217;s long-day miracle (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Recording that Jeiel lived right where his clan originated underscores stability and covenant loyalty. Like Ruth settling in Bethlehem (<a href="/ruth/1-22.htm">Ruth 1:22</a>), Jeiel&#8217;s residence displays God&#8217;s plan unfolding in familiar places.<p>&#8226; Gibeon later hosted one of Israel&#8217;s key high places where Solomon worshiped (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4&#8211;5</a>). Jeiel&#8217;s presence there foreshadows how God would use that location as a meeting point between heaven and earth.<p>&#8226; The verse quietly assures us that God plants His people where their lives will influence future generations (<a href="/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His wife&#8217;s name was Maacah</b><p>&#8226; Including Maacah&#8217;s name honors her role in the family line, just as Sarah (<a href="/genesis/17-15.htm">Genesis 17:15</a>), Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/24-67.htm">Genesis 24:67</a>), and Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-20.htm">1 Samuel 1:20</a>) are remembered for their faith.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Maacah&#8221; appears elsewhere (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>), showing it was a common name; still, the Chronicler singles out this Maacah so her contribution is never lost.<p>&#8226; Scripture&#8217;s pattern of naming women in genealogies&#8212;Tamar (<a href="/bsb/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>), Rahab, Ruth, Bathsheba (<a href="/bsb/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a>)&#8212;highlights God&#8217;s inclusive grace.<p>&#8226; By pairing Jeiel with Maacah, the text upholds the creation design of marital partnership (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>) and the blessing of family continuity (<a href="/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/8-29.htm">1 Chronicles 8:29</a> is more than a brief genealogical note.
