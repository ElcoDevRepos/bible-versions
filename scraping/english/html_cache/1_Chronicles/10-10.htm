This act was a common practice in the ancient Near East, symbolizing the victory of one nation's gods over another. By placing Saul's armor in their temple, the Philistines were declaring their gods' superiority over the God of Israel. This act of desecration was meant to humiliate Israel and demonstrate the power of the Philistine gods. The temple likely refers to one of the major Philistine cities such as Ashdod, Ashkelon, or Gaza, where such temples were located. This event echoes the earlier capture of the Ark of the Covenant by the Philistines, which they also placed in the temple of their god Dagon (<a href="/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-2</a>).<p><b>and hung his head in the temple of Dagon</b><br>Dagon was a major deity of the Philistines, often associated with grain and fertility. The act of hanging Saul's head in Dagon's temple was a further insult to Israel, signifying the complete defeat and humiliation of their king. This act also served as a public display of triumph and a warning to other nations. The temple of Dagon is notably mentioned in the story of Samson, where he brought down the temple on the Philistines (<a href="/judges/16-23.htm">Judges 16:23-30</a>). The desecration of Saul's body contrasts with the biblical emphasis on the dignity of the human body, even in death. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over false gods, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who triumphed over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant enemy of Israel, known for their conflicts with the Israelites throughout the Old Testament.

The Philistines treated Saul&#8217;s armor as war booty, displaying victory over Israel&#8217;s king much like in <a href="/1_samuel/31-9.htm">1 Samuel 31:9</a>,10 where they &#8220;stripped him and took his head and his armor.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Spoils of battle were tangible proof of a god&#8217;s supposed superiority (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>, where heathen nations &#8220;dedicated&#8221; stolen items to their idols).<p>&#8226; By removing Saul&#8217;s armor, they also broadcast the end of his earthly protection and leadership (contrast <a href="/1_samuel/17-38.htm">1 Samuel 17:38&#8211;39</a>, where Saul&#8217;s armor once symbolized royal strength).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the temple of their gods</b><p>&#8226; Placing the armor &#8220;in the temple of their gods&#8221; proclaimed that the Philistine deities had triumphed over the God of Israel (see <a href="/judges/16-23.htm">Judges 16:23</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This act tried to shame Israel, implying the LORD&#8217;s defeat&#8212;even though earlier He had warned that rebellion brings judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>).<p>&#8226; The location&#8212;Ashdod or Beth-shan&#8212;reinforced a public, civic celebration, echoing the pagan practice in <a href="/1_samuel/5-2.htm">1 Samuel 5:2</a> where the Ark was set &#8220;in the house of Dagon.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and hung his head</b><p>&#8226; Decapitation signified total conquest (compare David displaying Goliath&#8217;s head in <a href="/1_samuel/17-54.htm">1 Samuel 17:54</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s severed head mocked the anointed king who once stood &#8220;head and shoulders above the people&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/10-23.htm">1 Samuel 10:23</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_samuel/4-7.htm">2 Samuel 4:7</a> shows a similar grim trophy, underscoring how headship lost through sin leads to disgrace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the temple of Dagon</b><p>&#8226; The specific mention of Dagon focuses the insult: the same idol that fell before the Ark (<a href="/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3&#8211;4</a>) now seems to mock Israel&#8217;s first king.<p>&#8226; <a href="/judges/16-23.htm">Judges 16:23</a> records the Philistines crediting Dagon for Samson&#8217;s capture; here they repeat that claim regarding Saul, though in reality God had withdrawn His favor because of Saul&#8217;s disobedience (<a href="/1_chronicles/10-13.htm">1 Chronicles 10:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast is stark: the living God let His people face defeat to expose idolatry, while dead idols boast for a moment before ultimate judgment (<a href="/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a> paints a deliberate humiliation of Saul: his armor paraded as spoils, his head displayed beneath the idol Dagon, all to credit false gods with victory. Yet the wider context reveals this was God&#8217;s righteous judgment on a king who rejected His word. What appears to honor Dagon actually sets the stage for God to exalt David and later bring the Philistines low, proving again that the LORD alone is sovereign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">In the house of their gods.</span>--Or god, as LXX. Samuel, "house of Ashtaroth," which the chronicler or his source paraphrases, perhaps from a repugnance to mentioning the idol's name. Ashtoreth had a great temple at Ascalon, as "Heavenly Aphrodite" (Herod., <span class= "ital">Hist</span> i. 108). The "Queen of Heaven" (<a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm" title="The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.">Jeremiah 7:18</a>) was worshipped by the Semitic races generally. Under the name of <span class= "ital">Ishtar,</span> she was a chief goddess of the Assyrians, and had famous temples at Nineveh and Arbela. The Sabaeans worshipped her as <span class= "ital">Athtar;</span> and the name <span class= "ital">Ashtar</span> is coupled with Chemosh on the Moabite Stone.<p><span class= "bld">Fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and his skull </span>(<span class= "ital">gulgoleth</span>--comp. Golgotha, <a href="/matthew/27-33.htm" title="And when they were come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,">Matthew 27:33</a>) <span class= "ital">they fastened in the house of Dagon.</span> Instead of this, we read in Samuel, "and his corpse they fastened to the wall of Beth-shan." It is hardly likely that the one reading is a corruption of the other. The chronicler has omitted the statement about Saul's corpse, which is not mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/10-9.htm" title="And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings to their idols, and to the people.">1Chronicles 10:9</a>, and supplied one respecting his head, which has been already spoken of in that verse. He found the fact in his additional source, if the clause in question has not dropt out of the text of Samuel.<p>The Accadians worshipped Dagon, as we learn from the cuneiform inscriptions: comp. the name Ismi-Dagan (<span class= "ital">Dagon hears</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house of their gods</span>. In place of this general designation, the parallel (<a href="/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>) designates the house more exactly as "the house of Ashtaroth" (<a href="/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; the Phoenician female deity, as Baal was their male deity. The Greek form of the name is Astarte. See also Cic., 'De. Nat. Deo.,' 3:23). <span class="cmt_word">And fastened his head in the temple of Dagon</span>. The parallel, as above, gives us, "And fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shah" (which account is corroborated in <a href="/2_samuel/21-12.htm">2 Samuel 21:12-14</a>), and does not say what further was done with the head. It is no doubt remarkable that one historian puts on record the one fact and the other the other; and it is one of the clearer indications that both took from some common sources. It is perhaps something to be remarked also that, while the historian in Samuel says nothing further about the <span class="accented">head</span> (though allusion to it is probably included in the "body" and the "bones," the further account of which is given in vers. 12, 13, as well as in <a href="/2_samuel/21-12.htm">2 Samuel 21:12-14</a>), the compiler of Chronicles does revert to mention of "the <span class="accented">body</span> of Saul," ver. 12, <span class="accented">infra</span>, though without any corresponding naming of Beth-shah. Bertheau finds little difficulty in the question, by simply supposing that the omission in Chronicles is another instance of the desire to compress; while others suppose corruption in our text, or, as Thenius and Ewald, the loss of a sentence to our text. After all said, the omission in Samuel of the fate of the head would seem to be fully as remarkable as the omission, so far as this verse is concerned, in Chronicles of the fate of the body. It is reasonable to suppose that the head and trunk of the body of Saul were brought together again, or it were likely some allusion to the contrary would have transpired in the following verses of this chapter or in <a href="/2_samuel/21-12.htm">2 Samuel 21:12-14</a>. With regard to the act of the Philistines in dedicating the armour of Saul, and fixing his head in the temple of Dagon, as though trophies, the custom was both ancient and not uncommon (<a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21-30</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>). The house of Dagon (<a href="/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>) here spoken of was that at Ashdod (<a href="/joshua/15-47.htm">Joshua 15:47</a>), between Gaza and Joppa. Though belonging to Judah's lot, it was never subdued by Israel, and remained throughout their history one of their worst foes. It is the Azotus of <a href="/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>. There was another Dagon temple at Gaza (<a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21-31</a>). Dagon's representation was the figure of a man, as to head, hands, and bust, but for the rest that of a fish, which was a symbol of fruitfulness. As Ashdod was situate on the extreme west of Palestine, so Beth-shah - generally written Beth-shean, a city of Manasseh (ch. 7:29), though within the borders of Issachar (<a href="/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>), flora which the Canaanites were not expelled (<a href="/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27</a>) - was on the extreme east near the Jordan. It was afterwards called Scythopolis. Considering the distance these were apart, and their contrary directions, we may suppose that some suggestion was intended by the fixing the head in the one place and the body in the other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They put</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1433;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
