Heman is often associated with the sons of Korah and is noted for his wisdom and musical talent. Jeduthun, also known as Ethan, was a chief musician and is frequently mentioned in the Psalms. The phrase "those chosen" indicates a specific selection of individuals set apart for the sacred task of worship, highlighting the importance of music and praise in Israelite worship. This selection process underscores the organized and intentional nature of worship in the temple, reflecting the orderliness of God's creation and His desire for worship to be conducted with reverence and skill.<p><b>and designated by name</b><br>Being designated by name signifies a personal calling and recognition by God for a specific purpose. In biblical times, names held significant meaning and often reflected one's character or destiny. This personal designation emphasizes the intimate relationship between God and His servants, as well as the importance of each individual's role in the collective worship of the community. It also reflects the biblical theme of God knowing His people personally, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>, where God calls His people by name.<p><b>to give thanks to the LORD</b><br>Giving thanks to the LORD is a central theme in the worship practices of Israel. Thanksgiving is not merely an expression of gratitude but a recognition of God's sovereignty, provision, and faithfulness. This act of giving thanks is a response to God's covenantal relationship with His people, acknowledging His past deeds and trusting in His future promises. The practice of thanksgiving is deeply rooted in the Psalms and is a vital aspect of worship that continues into the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>.<p><b>for &#8220;His loving devotion endures forever.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a recurring refrain in the Psalms, particularly in <a href="/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136</a>, where it is repeated in every verse. It emphasizes the steadfast love and mercy of God, which is a central attribute of His character. The Hebrew word for "loving devotion" is "chesed," which encompasses love, mercy, kindness, and faithfulness. This enduring loving devotion is a key aspect of God's covenant with Israel and is ultimately fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, whose sacrificial love provides eternal redemption for humanity. The phrase serves as a reminder of God's unchanging nature and His eternal commitment to His people, offering hope and assurance throughout the generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heman.htm">Heman</a></b><br>A prominent Levite musician and seer, Heman was one of the leaders appointed by King David to minister with music before the Ark of the Covenant.
