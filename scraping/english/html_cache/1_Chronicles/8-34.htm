He is best known for his deep friendship with David, who would later become king. Jonathan's loyalty to David, despite his father Saul's animosity towards David, is a significant aspect of his character. This phrase highlights the continuation of Jonathan's lineage, which is important in the context of Israel's history and God's covenant promises. Jonathan's legacy is preserved through his descendants, despite the downfall of Saul's house.<p><b>Merib-baal,</b><br>Merib-baal is another name for Mephibosheth, Jonathan's son. The name "Merib-baal" means "Baal contends" or "Baal is my advocate," reflecting the cultural influence of Canaanite religion during that time. The use of "Baal" in names was common, though later generations would distance themselves from such associations due to Baal's connection with idolatry. Mephibosheth is known for his relationship with King David, who showed him kindness for Jonathan's sake, allowing him to eat at the king's table and restoring his grandfather Saul's land to him. This act of kindness is a reflection of David's covenant loyalty to Jonathan.<p><b>and Merib-baal was the father of Micah.</b><br>Micah, the son of Merib-baal, continues the lineage of Jonathan. This genealogical detail is significant as it demonstrates the preservation of Saul's line through Jonathan, despite the political and familial turmoil that surrounded Saul's reign and its aftermath. The mention of Micah also serves to connect the narrative of 1 Chronicles with the broader history of Israel, as genealogies were crucial for establishing identity and inheritance rights within the tribes of Israel. This lineage is a testament to God's faithfulness in maintaining the house of Jonathan, even as the Davidic line rose to prominence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.

His faithfulness lives on through his offspring.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Merib-baal</b><p>&#8220;&#8203;Merib-baal&#8221; (also called Mephibosheth in <a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>)<p>&#8226; Both names refer to the same individual. Mephibosheth was crippled at age five when his nurse fled after Saul and Jonathan died (<a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet here he stands not as a tragic figure but as a vital branch in the family tree. God&#8217;s Word records him by name to affirm that physical limitation never cancels divine significance (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-3.htm">Isaiah 46:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; David later showed covenant kindness to Mephibosheth, restoring Saul&#8217;s land and granting him a permanent place at the royal table (<a href="/2_samuel/9-6.htm">2 Samuel 9:6-13</a>). That grace echoes God&#8217;s own steadfast love toward His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Merib-baal was the father of Micah</b><p>&#8220;&#8203;and Merib-baal was the father of Micah&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse moves from Jonathan to Merib-baal to Micah, underscoring continuity&#8212;God preserves lineages for His purposes (<a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18-22</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Micah&#8217;s mention, though brief, assures readers that Saul&#8217;s household did not vanish. Later generations such as Azariah and others trace back to him (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-40.htm">1 Chronicles 9:40-44</a>), demonstrating that God keeps promises across centuries.<p>&#8226; This simple statement also prepares the ground for later prophetic hope: a future King would come from David, yet Saul&#8217;s line, too, would not be erased from covenant history (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/8-34.htm">1 Chronicles 8:34</a> faithfully records the lineage from Jonathan to Merib-baal to Micah, spotlighting God&#8217;s meticulous care for every family detail.
