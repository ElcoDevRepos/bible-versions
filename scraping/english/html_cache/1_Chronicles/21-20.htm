This activity indicates a time of harvest, a period of labor and provision. Ornan, also known as Araunah in other biblical texts, owned a threshing floor on Mount Moriah, a significant location in biblical history. This site is traditionally associated with the place where Abraham was to sacrifice Isaac (Genesis 22) and later became the location of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>). The act of threshing wheat symbolizes separation and purification, themes that resonate throughout Scripture.<p><b>when he turned and saw the angel</b><br>The appearance of an angel signifies a divine intervention or message. In the context of <a href="/1_chronicles/21.htm">1 Chronicles 21</a>, the angel is executing God's judgment due to David's sin of conducting a census. Angels often appear in the Bible as messengers or agents of God's will, such as in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a> with the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The presence of the angel here underscores the seriousness of the situation and the direct involvement of God in the affairs of Israel. This moment of divine revelation is pivotal, as it leads to David's repentance and the eventual establishment of the temple site.<p><b>and his four sons who were with him hid themselves</b><br>The reaction of Ornan's sons reflects the natural human response to the divine and the supernatural. Fear and awe are common reactions to angelic appearances, as seen in other biblical accounts like the shepherds in <a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>. The hiding of Ornan's sons can also be seen as a reflection of the holiness and power of God, which often causes humans to recognize their own frailty and sinfulness. This moment highlights the contrast between divine holiness and human fear, a theme that runs throughout Scripture, reminding believers of the need for reverence and humility before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/ornan.htm">Ornan (Araunah)</a></b><br>A Jebusite who owned the threshing floor where David was instructed to build an altar to the Lord.

God often steps into the routines of life to advance His larger redemptive story.<p>&#8226; Threshing required wind to separate chaff from grain, so the floor stood high, overlooking Jerusalem. From that vantage point Ornan could see what others below did not&#8212;much like Gideon in <a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a> threshing in secret, or Ruth meeting Boaz at night on a threshing floor (<a href="/ruth/3-2.htm">Ruth 3:2&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; David will soon buy this very spot to erect an altar, turning a workplace into a place of worship (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-25.htm">1 Chronicles 21:25&#8211;26</a>). God transforms the ordinary for His glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when he turned and saw the angel</b><p>&#8226; Verse 16 has already described &#8220;the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, with a drawn sword in his hand.&#8221; Ornan now turns and sees the same formidable messenger.<p>&#8226; Encounters with angels in Scripture often produce awe: Balaam&#8217;s donkey saw the angel first (<a href="/numbers/22-31.htm">Numbers 22:31</a>); Joshua met the Commander of the LORD&#8217;s army (<a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13&#8211;14</a>); the shepherds at Bethlehem were &#8220;terrified&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; This angel is executing judgment for David&#8217;s census sin, yet also points toward mercy, for God will soon command the sword to be sheathed (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-27.htm">1 Chronicles 21:27</a>). The vision underlines God&#8217;s holiness and justice, but also His readiness to relent when atonement is made.<p>&#8226; Ornan&#8217;s turning suggests a sudden, overwhelming awareness of the divine&#8212;proof that heaven can break into the mundane at any moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his four sons who were with him hid themselves</b><p>&#8226; Terror is a natural human response to God&#8217;s unveiled holiness. Adam and Eve &#8220;hid themselves from the presence of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>). Israel trembled at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18&#8211;19</a>). People in <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15</a> seek caves to escape the Lamb&#8217;s wrath.<p>&#8226; The four sons&#8217; instinct to hide highlights the contrast between sinful humanity and God&#8217;s perfect purity. Even righteous men like Daniel fell on their faces before angels (<a href="/daniel/10-7.htm">Daniel 10:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their hiding also sets the stage for David&#8217;s bold approach. While the sons flee, David will come, purchase the floor, build an altar, and see the plague stopped&#8212;anticipating the greater Son of David who will stand where others cannot and make full atonement (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>).<p>&#8226; In mercy, God allows Ornan&#8217;s family to survive this encounter, underscoring <a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13&#8211;14</a>&#8212;He remembers our frame and spares us despite our frailty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/21-20.htm">1 Chronicles 21:20</a> shows an ordinary farmer suddenly confronted by the angel of the LORD. While engaged in daily work, Ornan turns, sees divine judgment, and his sons hide in fear. The scene underscores God&#8217;s ability to break into human routine, His blazing holiness that causes sinners to tremble, and His plan to convert a common threshing floor into the future site of His temple. In a single verse, God&#8217;s sovereignty over history, His justice against sin, and His mercy toward the humble all converge, preparing the ground&#8212;literally and spiritually&#8212;for redemptive worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">And Ornan turned back</span> <span class= "bld">(<span class= "ital">returned</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and saw the angel;</span> <span class= "bld">and his</span> <span class= "bld">four sons with him hid</span> <span class= "bld">themselves </span>(<span class= "ital">were hiding</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> There can be little doubt that this is corrupt, and that the text of Samuel is right, "And Araunah looked up, and saw the king and his servants passing by him." The LXX. here has "Ornan turned, and saw the king;" the Vulg., "when Ornan had looked up" The Hebrew words for "returned" and "looked up," "angel" and "king," are similar enough to be easily confused in an ill-written or failed MS.<p><span class= "bld">Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</span>--This clause does not harmonise with the preceding statement, but its genuineness is made probable by the fact that Ornan was in his threshingfloor at the time. Moreover, the LXX. adds to <a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm" title="So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.">2Samuel 24:15</a>, "And David chose for himself the death; and it was the days of wheat harvest."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - This verse is not found in the parallel place. The Septuagint reading of "king" in this verse, in place of "angel," is no doubt an error. The drift of this and the following verse is plain and continuous. Ornan and his sons had hidden themselves on the apparition of the angel, but came out on the advent of David, to welcome him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/21-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Ornan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1431;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;n&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_771.htm">Strong's 771: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ornan -- a Jebusite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was threshing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1758.htm">Strong's 1758: </a> </span><span class="str2">To trample, thresh</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wheat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1460;&#1496;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;i&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2406.htm">Strong's 2406: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wheat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;n&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
