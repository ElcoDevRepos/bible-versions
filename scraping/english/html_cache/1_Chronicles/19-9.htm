Their decision to march out indicates a proactive stance in the conflict, showing their confidence and readiness for battle. This reflects the ongoing hostilities between Israel and its neighboring nations, often rooted in historical grievances and territorial disputes.<p><b>and arrayed themselves for battle</b><br>The phrase suggests a strategic military formation, indicating preparation and organization. In ancient warfare, the arrangement of troops was crucial for defense and attack. This preparation reflects the seriousness with which the Ammonites approached the impending conflict, possibly underestimating Israel's military capabilities.<p><b>at the entrance to the city</b><br>Positioning at the city entrance was a tactical move, providing a defensive advantage and control over access points. This location would have been significant for both defense and as a psychological tactic to intimidate the approaching enemy. Cities in ancient times were often fortified, and controlling the entrance was vital for protection and maintaining supply lines.<p><b>while the kings who had come stayed by themselves</b><br>The presence of allied kings suggests a coalition against Israel, indicating the threat Israel posed to surrounding nations. These kings likely provided additional troops and resources, highlighting the regional impact of Israel's growing power. Their decision to stay by themselves might suggest a lack of unity or trust among the allies, or a strategic reserve force.<p><b>in the open country</b><br>Staying in the open country could imply a strategic reserve or a lack of fortifications, making them vulnerable to attack. This positioning might reflect a cultural or tactical decision, possibly to avoid being trapped within city walls or to provide a quick retreat if necessary. The open country also symbolizes exposure and reliance on military prowess rather than defensive structures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ammonites.htm">The Ammonites</a></b><br>A group of people descended from Lot, often in conflict with Israel.
