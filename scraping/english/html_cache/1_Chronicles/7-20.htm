Ephraim and his brother Manasseh were adopted by Jacob as his own sons, thus receiving a portion of the inheritance among the tribes of Israel. Ephraim's descendants became one of the most prominent tribes in Israel, often representing the northern kingdom. The tribe's territory was centrally located in the land of Canaan, which included significant sites such as Shiloh, where the tabernacle was located for a time.<p><b>Shuthelah:</b><br>Shuthelah is listed as a direct descendant of Ephraim. His name appears in other genealogical records, such as <a href="/numbers/26-35.htm">Numbers 26:35</a>, where the family of the Shuthelahites is mentioned. This indicates the establishment of a clan within the tribe of Ephraim, contributing to the tribe's growth and influence.<p><b>Bered his son:</b><br>Bered is noted as the son of Shuthelah. The genealogical records in Chronicles often serve to establish the continuity and legitimacy of tribal lines. While not much is known about Bered specifically, his inclusion underscores the importance of maintaining detailed family records in Israelite culture.<p><b>Tahath his son:</b><br>Tahath is another link in the genealogical chain. The repetition of names like Tahath in the genealogy may indicate the common practice of naming descendants after ancestors, reflecting a desire to honor family heritage and maintain continuity within the tribe.<p><b>Eleadah his son:</b><br>Eleadah is listed as the son of Tahath. The genealogies in Chronicles often highlight the faithfulness of God in preserving the lineage of His people, despite the challenges and disruptions they faced throughout history.<p><b>Tahath his son:</b><br>The repetition of the name Tahath suggests a cyclical pattern in the genealogy, which may symbolize the enduring nature of the tribe of Ephraim. This pattern can also be seen as a reflection of the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His covenant promises, ensuring the survival and prosperity of His chosen people through successive generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>The second son of Joseph, born in Egypt.

Each generation in Ephraim&#8217;s line&#8212;Shuthelah, Bered, Tahath, Eleadah, and another Tahath&#8212;proves that the Lord preserves, records, and redeems families for His purposes. The verse calls modern believers to cherish their spiritual heritage, live faithfully in their moment, and hand off an unbroken witness to those who come next.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-27.</span> - The chief difficulty of this passage lies in reconciling the points of chronology which it forces to the surface. Vers. 20, 21, purport to contain the line of descent from Ephraim through his son Shu-thelah to the seventh generation, viz. to another Shuthelah. The remaining two names, Ezer and Elead, may perhaps be two brothers of the first Shuthelah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> own sons of Ephraim. If it be so, these two must not be supposed to correspond with Becher and Tahan, called "sons of Ephraim" in <a href="/numbers/26-35.htm">Numbers 26:35</a>; for it is evident that they were generations <span class="accented">succeeding</span> Shuthelah. Now, Ephraim was born in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/46-20.htm">Genesis 46:20</a>), so that, on the above showing, the actual sons of Ephraim must have made some incursion from Egypt into the territories of the settled or possibly aboriginal inhabitants of Gath, and met the fate over which Ephraim so mourned. Such excursions on the part of the Israelites out of Egypt have very little collateral evidence. But there would seem to be no impossibility in the matter, considering <a href="/genesis/50-13.htm">Genesis 50:13-23</a>. Next, vers. 23-27 seem to say that in his sorrow Ephraim has another son, whom he names Beriah, and of whose line in the ninth descent comes Joshua, the son of Nun. This also is very doubtful. It may very possibly be that the parenthesis continues to the end of ver. 23 or 24, and that vers. 25-27 carry on the generations from ver. 21. Meantime welcome light breaks in at the stage (ver. 26) at which Ammihud and Elishama are mentioned. For we find these immediate ancestors of the great Joshua repeatedly mentioned at the period of the Exodus (<a href="/numbers/1-10.htm">Numbers 1:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/2-18.htm">Numbers 2:18</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-48.htm">Numbers 7:48</a>, etc.); yet none of these places assist us to say that he did or did not come through Beriah. It is impossible to solve with any certainty the involved question of chronology and genealogy presented by this section. The passage is evidently mutilated and corrupt, though vindicating a high antiquity. Avery original presentation of the whole section, as ingenious as it is conjectural, by Lord A.C. Hervey, may be found in the art. "Shuthclah," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1305. It is well worthy of attention that a great point is made in bringing Joshua to the place of the eighth generation from Joseph, in near analogy with the numbers in so many other known cases, of the generations that intervened from the descent into Egypt to the entrance into Canaan. There also may be found the most and best that can be said against the literal reading of what is here written respecting the men of Gath and the cattle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/7-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The descendants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
