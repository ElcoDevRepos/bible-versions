In the context of <a href="/1_chronicles/16.htm">1 Chronicles 16</a>, David is celebrating the return of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, a significant event symbolizing God's presence among His people. Thanksgiving is a central aspect of worship, as seen in Psalms 100:4, which encourages entering God's presence with thanksgiving. The act of giving thanks is not only a response to God's blessings but also a recognition of His sovereignty and goodness.<p><b>call upon His name;</b><br>Calling upon the name of the LORD signifies invoking His presence and power. In ancient Israel, names held significant meaning and were often associated with one's character and authority. To call upon God's name is to seek His intervention and acknowledge His authority. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a>, where people began to call on the name of the LORD. It reflects a relationship of trust and dependence on God.<p><b>make known His deeds among the nations.</b><br>This phrase highlights the missional aspect of Israel's faith, which is to proclaim God's mighty works to all peoples. The historical context of Israel as a chosen nation was to be a light to the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>. The deeds of God, including creation, deliverance, and covenant faithfulness, were to be shared beyond Israel's borders. This foreshadows the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations, spreading the knowledge of God's salvation through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel who organized the return of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem and led the people in worship and thanksgiving to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence with His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the Ark was brought, symbolizing the central place of worship and the heart of Israel's spiritual life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph_and_his_brothers.htm">Asaph and his brothers</a></b><br>Levites appointed by David to minister before the Ark, leading the people in songs of thanksgiving and praise.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to all peoples outside of Israel, highlighting the call to proclaim God's deeds beyond the borders of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_thanksgiving.htm">The Importance of Thanksgiving</a></b><br>Thanksgiving is a vital part of worship and acknowledges God's sovereignty and goodness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/calling_on_god's_name.htm">Calling on God's Name</a></b><br>Invoking God's name signifies trust and reliance on His power and character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/proclaiming_god's_deeds.htm">Proclaiming God's Deeds</a></b><br>Believers are called to share testimonies of God's work in their lives, spreading His glory to all people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/evangelism_and_witness.htm">Evangelism and Witness</a></b><br>The call to make God's deeds known among the nations is a precursor to the Great Commission, emphasizing the global mission of the Church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_worship.htm">Community Worship</a></b><br>Corporate worship, as seen in David's assembly, strengthens the faith community and encourages collective thanksgiving and praise.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Chronicles_16_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Chronicles 16:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ways_to_thank_the_LORD_daily.htm">How can we "give thanks to the LORD" in our daily lives today?

David wrote these words while the Ark was being placed in the tent he had prepared (1 Chron 16:1). In that jubilant setting, thanking God was more than polite; it was commanded worship.<p>&#8226; Gratitude recognizes God&#8217;s faithful acts&#8212;just as <a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a> urges, &#8220;Enter His gates with thanksgiving.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Thanksgiving anchors us in God&#8217;s goodness when life is calm and when it storms (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Gratitude is expressed with words, music (1 Chron 16:9), offerings (<a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12</a>) and obedience (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>).<p>When God&#8217;s people truly give thanks, they acknowledge His sovereignty, reflect His character, and invite His continued presence (<a href="/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Call upon His name</b><p>To &#8220;call upon His name&#8221; means more than saying &#8220;Lord, help me.&#8221; Biblically, a name embodies character and authority.<p>&#8226; Calling on His name affirms total dependence (<a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>&#8212;&#8220;Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you&#8221;).<p>&#8226; It is personal: <a href="/jeremiah/29-12.htm">Jeremiah 29:12&#8211;13</a> links calling on God with seeking Him wholeheartedly.<p>&#8226; It is salvific: <a href="/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a> quotes Joel, &#8220;Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.&#8221;<p>In David&#8217;s day the Ark symbolized God&#8217;s throne; calling on His name declared, &#8220;You reign here.&#8221; Today, every prayer that begins &#8220;Father, in Jesus&#8217; name&#8221; echoes that same confession.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Make known His deeds among the nations</b><p>Thanksgiving and prayer naturally spill into testimony. God&#8217;s &#8220;deeds&#8221; are to be broadcast, not bottled up.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s choir was to proclaim God&#8217;s wonders beyond Israel&#8217;s borders (<a href="/psalms/9-11.htm">Psalm 9:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/12-4.htm">Isaiah 12:4</a> repeats this very line).<p>&#8226; The command anticipates the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), showing mission was always God&#8217;s heartbeat.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> reveals the power-source: the Spirit enables witnesses &#8220;to the ends of the earth.&#8221;<p>Practical outflow:<p>&#8211; Tell a neighbor what God has done for you (<a href="/mark/5-19.htm">Mark 5:19</a>).<p>&#8211; Support or go on a mission endeavor (<a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8211; Use your platform&#8212;social media, workplace, classroom&#8212;to highlight His faithfulness (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/16-8.htm">1 Chronicles 16:8</a> strings together three inseparable responses to God&#8217;s presence: gratitude, prayerful reliance, and global proclamation.

David makes selections from four psalms already known; for it cannot be supposed that the verses we have here were the original, and that they were afterwards supplemented. The first fifteen verses (viz. 8-22) are from <a href="/psalms/105-1.htm">Psalm 105:1-15</a>. The next eleven verses (23-33) are from <a href="/psalms/96-1.htm">Psalm 96:1-13</a>; but a small portion of the first and last of these verses is omitted. Our thirty-fourth verse is identical with <a href="/psalms/107-1.htm">Psalm 107:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-1.htm">Psalm 118:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/136-1.htm">Psalm 136:1</a>; and forms the larger part of <a href="/psalms/106-1.htm">Psalm 106:1</a>. It is, in fact, a doxology. And our thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth verses consist of a short responsive ("and say ye") invocation, followed by another doxology. These are taken from <a href="/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47, 48</a>. Hereupon "all the people" are directed to find the final outburst of praise to Jehovah, and "Amen." In the first of these selections (vers. 8-23) there is no material variation from the language of the psalm itself. Yet the original psalm has <span class="accented">Abraham</span>, where our own thirteenth verse reads <span class="accented">Israel.</span> And the original psalm uses the third person, where our fifteenth and nineteenth verses have the second person. In the second selection it is worthy of note that our ver. 29, "Come before him," probably preserves the ante-temple reading, while <a href="/psalms/96-8.htm">Psalm 96:8</a> was afterwards, to fit temple times, altered into, "<span class="accented">Come</span> <span class="accented">into his courts."</span> The arrangement of all the succeeding clauses does not exactly agree with the arrangement of them found in the psalm, as for instance in the latter half of our ver. 30 and in ver. 31, compared with the clauses of vers. 10,11 of the psalm. Again, one clause of the tenth verse of the psalm, "He shall judge the people righteously," is not found in either alternative position open to it through the inversion of clauses, in our vers. 80, 81. The rhythm and metre of the psalm are, however, equally unexceptionable. The whole of the twenty-nine verses of this Psalm of praise (vers. 8-36 inclusive) are divided into portions of three verses each, except the portion vers. 23-27 inclusive which consists of five verses. As regards the matter of it, it may be remarked on as breaking into two parts, in the first of which (vers. 8-22) the people are reminded of their past history and of the marvellous providence which had governed their career from Abraham to the time they were settled in Canaan, but in the second (vers. 23-36) their thought is enlarged, their sympathies immensely widened, so as to include all the world, and their view is borne on to the momentous reality of <span class="accented">judgment.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - These verses are an animated invocation to thanks and praise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/16-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Give thanks</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3034.htm">Strong's 3034: </a> </span><span class="str2">To throw, at, away, to revere, worship, to bemoan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the LORD;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
