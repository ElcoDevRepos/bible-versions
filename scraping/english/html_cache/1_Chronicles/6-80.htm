Gad was one of the tribes that settled on the eastern side of the Jordan River, in the region known as Gilead. This location was chosen because of its suitability for their large herds and flocks. The tribe of Gad was known for its warriors, as noted in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>, where they are described as brave and skilled in battle. The allocation of cities to the Levites from the tribe of Gad reflects the broader distribution of Levitical cities among the tribes of Israel, as commanded by God to ensure the Levites had places to live and serve throughout the land.<p><b>they were given Ramoth in Gilead</b><br>Ramoth in Gilead was a significant city located in the territory of Gad. It served as one of the cities of refuge, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-43.htm">Deuteronomy 4:43</a> and <a href="/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>, where individuals who committed unintentional manslaughter could seek asylum. This city was strategically important due to its location in the Transjordan region, making it a key military and administrative center. Ramoth in Gilead is also mentioned in the context of various battles, such as in <a href="/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a>, where King Ahab of Israel sought to reclaim it from the Arameans. The city's role as a city of refuge highlights the biblical theme of justice and mercy, providing a place of protection and fair trial.<p><b>Mahanaim</b><br>Mahanaim was another city in the territory of Gad, located east of the Jordan River. The name "Mahanaim" means "two camps," and it is first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>, where Jacob encounters angels of God and names the place Mahanaim. This city later became significant during the reign of King David. In <a href="/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>, David fled to Mahanaim during Absalom's rebellion, and it served as his temporary capital. The city's dual significance as both a spiritual and political center underscores its importance in Israel's history. Mahanaim's location in Gilead made it a natural stronghold and a place of refuge, reflecting God's provision and protection for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_gad.htm">Tribe of Gad</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Gad, the seventh son of Jacob and Zilpah.

The tribe of Gad, settled east of the Jordan (<a href="/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34&#8211;36</a>), is singled out as the source of two specific towns for the descendants of Aaron.<p>- God had earlier directed that the Levites would receive no territorial allotment like the other tribes; instead, they were to be scattered in forty-eight cities (<a href="/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1-8</a>). Placing Levitical cities among every tribe ensured that worship, instruction, and sacrificial oversight would permeate the whole nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>).<p>- The mention of Gad illustrates the unity of Israel: every tribe, even those across the Jordan, shared responsibility for providing for the priesthood (cf. <a href="/joshua/13-24.htm">Joshua 13:24-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they were given</b><p>- &#8220;They&#8221; refers to &#8220;the descendants of Aaron&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-57.htm">1 Chronicles 6:57</a>), the priestly line within the tribe of Levi. The phrase underlines that the cities were granted, not earned. As the Lord had said, &#8220;I am your portion and your inheritance&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>).<p>- The giving was enacted by the tribes yet initiated by God: &#8220;Command the Israelites to give the Levites cities to dwell in&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2</a>). Every donation of land therefore reflected obedience to divine command and acknowledgment of the Levites&#8217; spiritual service (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-2</a>).<p>- Practical outworking: priests living among the people could instruct in the Law (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-7.htm">2 Chronicles 17:7-9</a>) and settle disputes according to God&#8217;s standards (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ramoth in Gilead</b><p>- Ramoth was one of the six designated cities of refuge (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-43.htm">Deuteronomy 4:43</a>; <a href="/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>). Anyone who killed unintentionally could flee there until trial, a vivid picture of both justice and mercy.<p>- Situated in the fertile highlands of Gilead, it later became a strategic fortress contested by Israel and Aram (<a href="/1_kings/22-3.htm">1 Kings 22:3-4</a>). Its Levitical status did not disappear even when armies fought over it; God&#8217;s purposes stood regardless of political upheaval.<p>- By assigning a city of refuge to the priests, the Lord ensured that life-and-death cases were handled where His word was taught daily, highlighting the sanctity of life (<a href="/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mahanaim</b><p>- First mentioned when Jacob met the angels of God and said, &#8220;This is God&#8217;s camp&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>). The name means &#8220;two camps,&#8221; reflecting human and angelic hosts dwelling side by side.<p>- Mahanaim served as David&#8217;s headquarters while fleeing Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24-27</a>), symbolizing a haven in crisis. Housing priests there underscored that refuge ultimately rests in God&#8217;s presence.<p>- Located along major east-Jordan trade routes, Mahanaim allowed Levites to influence travelers and shepherd the spiritual life of Gad&#8217;s border region (cf. <a href="/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-80.htm">1 Chronicles 6:80</a> records God&#8217;s faithful provision for His priests through the tribe of Gad. Two towns, Ramoth and Mahanaim, were set apart so that worship, teaching, and mercy would reach every corner of Israel&#8212;even the territories beyond the Jordan. The verse quietly affirms timeless truths: the Lord cares for those who serve Him, justice and refuge are rooted in His design, and His presence transforms ordinary places into holy ground.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/6-80.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And from the tribe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1448;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mim&#183;ma&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#234;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-m &#124;
