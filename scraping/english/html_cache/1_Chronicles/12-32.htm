This tribe was known for its agricultural prowess, as their territory was fertile and conducive to farming. The tribe's location in the Jezreel Valley, a strategic and fertile area, contributed to their prosperity and influence. In the context of <a href="/1_chronicles/12.htm">1 Chronicles 12</a>, the men of Issachar are joining David at Hebron to support his kingship, indicating their political insight and loyalty.<p><b>Men who understood the times</b><br>The men of Issachar are noted for their wisdom and discernment, particularly in understanding the times. This suggests they had a keen awareness of the political and social climate, which was crucial during the transition of power from Saul to David. Their ability to interpret the times can be likened to the wisdom literature in the Bible, such as Proverbs, which emphasizes understanding and discernment. This insight is also reminiscent of the sons of Issachar's role in advising Deborah in <a href="/judges/5-15.htm">Judges 5:15</a>.<p><b>And knew what Israel should do</b><br>Their understanding translated into practical action, as they knew what steps Israel should take. This reflects a combination of wisdom and leadership, as they were able to guide the nation in a time of change. This ability to discern and act is a valuable trait for leaders, as seen in other biblical figures like Joseph and Daniel, who also provided guidance during critical times.<p><b>200 chiefs</b><br>The mention of 200 chiefs indicates a significant number of leaders within the tribe of Issachar. This suggests a well-organized and influential group capable of making collective decisions. The presence of such a large number of leaders highlights the tribe's importance and the weight their support would carry in the political landscape of Israel.<p><b>With all their kinsmen at their command</b><br>The chiefs had the loyalty and support of their kinsmen, indicating a unified tribe. This unity would have been essential in presenting a strong front and ensuring that their decisions were backed by the entire tribe. The solidarity within the tribe of Issachar is a testament to their leadership and the respect they commanded, which would have been crucial in supporting David's claim to the throne.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_issachar.htm">Sons of Issachar</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel known for their wisdom and understanding of the times.
