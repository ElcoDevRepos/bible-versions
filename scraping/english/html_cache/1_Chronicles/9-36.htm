In biblical times, the firstborn son often received a double portion of the inheritance and was expected to lead the family. This reflects the cultural importance of birth order in ancient Israelite society. The name Abdon means "servant" or "worshiper," which may indicate a family dedication to serving God.<p><b>then Zur</b><br>Zur is a name that appears in various contexts in the Bible, often associated with strength or rock. This name may reflect the family's hope for stability and resilience. The mention of Zur in this genealogy highlights the importance of each family member in the continuation of the tribal and national identity of Israel.<p><b>Kish</b><br>Kish is a significant name in the biblical narrative, as he is also the father of King Saul, Israel's first king. This connection underscores the importance of genealogies in establishing the legitimacy and heritage of Israel's leaders. Kish's lineage is crucial in understanding the transition from the period of the judges to the monarchy.<p><b>Baal</b><br>The name Baal, meaning "lord" or "master," is complex due to its association with both a Canaanite deity and as a common name or title in Israel. In this context, it likely serves as a personal name without idolatrous connotations. The use of such names reflects the cultural interactions and influences between Israel and its neighbors.<p><b>Ner</b><br>Ner is another significant figure, as he is the father of Abner, the commander of Saul's army. This connection highlights the military and political roles that members of this family played in Israel's history. The name Ner, meaning "lamp" or "light," may symbolize guidance or leadership.<p><b>Nadab</b><br>Nadab, meaning "generous" or "noble," is a name that appears elsewhere in the Bible, including as the name of Aaron's son. This reflects a tradition of naming within Israelite families that often carried significant meanings or aspirations. The inclusion of Nadab in this genealogy emphasizes the continuity and faithfulness of the family line.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>A descendant of Saul, mentioned in the genealogies of the tribe of Benjamin.

(<a href="/1_chronicles/9-36.htm">1 Chronicles 9:36</a>)<p>&#8226; The firstborn son in Scripture receives special acknowledgment, reflecting primacy and responsibility (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Abdon heads this list, signaling the continuation of Jehiel&#8217;s line within Benjamin (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness to every generation is underscored here; nothing in a family line is overlooked by Him (<a href="/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zur</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;then Zur&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Zur, second in the lineup, reminds us that God often builds His purposes through those beyond the firstborn as well (<a href="/genesis/48-13.htm">Genesis 48:13-20</a>).<p>&#8226; His name evokes the image of strength and stability; Scripture repeatedly portrays the Lord as a sure &#8220;rock&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/22-2.htm">2 Samuel 22:2-3</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Even lesser-known figures like Zur testify that every life in God&#8217;s plan has meaning, no matter how briefly mentioned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Kish</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;Kish&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Kish is crucial because he is the father of King Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; This brief notice ties the Chronicler&#8217;s genealogy to Israel&#8217;s first monarchy, showing God&#8217;s sovereign weaving of history (<a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The placement here prepares readers for how a seemingly ordinary family becomes central to national leadership (<a href="/acts/13-21.htm">Acts 13:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Baal</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;Baal&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Early Israelite names occasionally included the term &#8220;Baal,&#8221; meaning &#8220;lord&#8221; or &#8220;master,&#8221; before association with Canaanite idolatry dominated the word (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-30.htm">1 Chronicles 8:30</a>).<p>&#8226; The presence of the name illustrates how language and culture shift over time (compare <a href="/hosea/2-16.htm">Hosea 2:16</a>).<p>&#8226; It also highlights the Chronicler&#8217;s honesty&#8212;recording names exactly as they were without alteration, affirming Scripture&#8217;s historical precision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ner</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;Ner&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Ner is the father of Abner, Saul&#8217;s cousin and commander (<a href="/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50-51</a>).<p>&#8226; Through Ner the text links Saul&#8217;s royal house to its military leadership, revealing how family networks shaped Israel&#8217;s early kingdom.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s providence is evident in charting these connections, ensuring leadership structures suited Israel&#8217;s needs (<a href="/2_samuel/3-6.htm">2 Samuel 3:6-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nadab</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;Nadab.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Though sharing his name with the son of Aaron (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1</a>), this Nadab stands in the Benjamite line.<p>&#8226; The repetition of certain names across tribes reminds us that God tracks each individual lineage (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; By ending the verse with Nadab, the Chronicler completes a six-son portrait that displays fullness and balance within the family (compare <a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18-22</a> for another concise genealogy).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/9-36.htm">1 Chronicles 9:36</a>, while a single verse, threads six sons into the tapestry of Benjamin&#8217;s heritage: Abdon, Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, and Nadab. Each name confirms God&#8217;s meticulous record-keeping, underscores the value of every generation, and prepares the way for key figures&#8212;especially Kish, father of Saul. The verse quietly but powerfully proclaims that nothing in God&#8217;s Word is incidental; every detail serves His redemptive storyline, demonstrating His faithfulness from one generation to the next.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">Zur.</span>--"Rock," a Divine title.
