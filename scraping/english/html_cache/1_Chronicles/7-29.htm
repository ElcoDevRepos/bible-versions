Manasseh's territory was divided between land on the east and west of the Jordan River. The western portion bordered several key cities, indicating its strategic importance. This area was known for its fertile land and was significant in the history of Israel due to its location and resources.<p><b>were Beth-shean, Taanach, Megiddo, and Dor</b><br>These cities were significant in ancient Israel. Beth-shean was a major city in the Jordan Valley, known for its strategic location and later as a site of a Philistine victory over King Saul. Taanach and Megiddo were located in the Jezreel Valley, a crucial trade and military route. Megiddo, in particular, is famous for its association with the prophetic "Armageddon" (<a href="/revelation/16-16.htm">Revelation 16:16</a>). Dor was a coastal city, important for trade and commerce. These cities were centers of Canaanite culture before being integrated into Israelite territory.<p><b>together with their villages</b><br>The mention of villages indicates the broader region and smaller settlements that were part of the administrative and economic structure of these cities. These villages supported the larger cities and were integral to the agricultural and social life of the area. The inclusion of villages highlights the comprehensive nature of the territory under Manasseh's influence.<p><b>The descendants of Joseph son of Israel lived in these towns</b><br>Joseph, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, was given a double portion of inheritance through his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. This phrase emphasizes the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing over Joseph, where his descendants would be fruitful and multiply in the land. The presence of Joseph's descendants in these towns signifies the continuation of God's promise to the patriarchs and the establishment of Israel in the Promised Land.
