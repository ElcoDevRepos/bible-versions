This moment is significant as it marks the transition of leadership and the continuation of God's covenant with David's lineage. Solomon is tasked with building the temple, a project David had prepared for but was not permitted to complete due to his history as a warrior (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8</a>).<p><b>Be strong and courageous, and do it</b><br>This exhortation echoes God's words to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6-9</a>) as he prepared to lead Israel into the Promised Land. It emphasizes the need for strength and courage in fulfilling God's commands. Solomon is encouraged to act decisively in building the temple, a monumental task requiring both physical and spiritual fortitude.<p><b>Do not be afraid or discouraged</b><br>Fear and discouragement are common human responses to daunting tasks. David reassures Solomon, reminding him that God&#8217;s presence dispels fear. This assurance is a recurring biblical theme, seen in God's promises to leaders like Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-8.htm">Deuteronomy 31:8</a>) and Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>).<p><b>for the LORD God, my God, is with you</b><br>David personalizes his faith, emphasizing his relationship with God and passing this assurance to Solomon. The presence of God is a central promise throughout Scripture, providing comfort and strength (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). It underscores the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>He will neither fail you nor forsake you</b><br>This promise of God's faithfulness is foundational in Scripture, reflecting His unchanging nature (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>). It assures Solomon of divine support, reinforcing that God&#8217;s plans will be accomplished through him, just as He had been faithful to David.<p><b>before all the work for the service of the house of the LORD is finished</b><br>The temple, a central place of worship, symbolizes God's dwelling among His people. Its completion is crucial for Israel's spiritual life. This phrase highlights the importance of perseverance until the task is fully accomplished, reflecting the biblical principle of finishing the work God assigns (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>). Solomon's temple foreshadows the ultimate dwelling of God with humanity through Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is nearing the end of his reign.
