This unity is a fulfillment of God's promise to David, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>, where God establishes David's house and kingdom. David's leadership is a type of Christ, who unites all believers under His spiritual reign. The phrase also highlights the geographical expanse of David's rule, encompassing the entire land promised to the patriarchs, from Dan to Beersheba.<p><b>and administered justice and righteousness</b><br>David's administration of justice and righteousness reflects his role as a king after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). This phrase underscores the biblical principle that true leadership involves upholding God's standards of justice and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>. David's reign is characterized by fairness and adherence to God's law, setting a standard for future kings. This mirrors the Messianic prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>, where the Messiah's government is established on justice and righteousness.<p><b>for all his people</b><br>David's commitment to justice and righteousness extends to all his people, indicating an inclusive and equitable governance. This phrase emphasizes the king's responsibility to care for the entire nation, not just a select group. It reflects the biblical ideal of a shepherd-king, as seen in <a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-72</a>, where David is described as shepherding Israel with integrity of heart. This inclusivity foreshadows the universal reach of Christ's kingdom, where all nations are invited to partake in His salvation (<a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, David is the king of Israel, known for his heart after God and his leadership qualities.
