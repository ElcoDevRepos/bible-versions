In the Hebrew context, the heart and soul represent the entirety of one's being, indicating that seeking God requires complete dedication. This mirrors the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. It underscores the biblical principle that true worship and service to God begin with an internal commitment.<p><b>Begin building the sanctuary of the LORD God,</b><br>David is instructing Solomon to commence the construction of the temple, a central place of worship for Israel. The sanctuary represents God's dwelling among His people, a concept rooted in the tabernacle's design given to Moses (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8-9</a>). The temple's construction signifies a transition from a nomadic worship system to a permanent, centralized location in Jerusalem, which holds significant historical and theological importance as the city of David.<p><b>so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD</b><br>The ark of the covenant is a sacred chest that held the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and manna, symbolizing God's covenant with Israel. Its presence in the temple signifies God's throne and His covenantal relationship with His people. The ark's movement to the temple marks a fulfillment of God's promises and a centralization of worship, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a> when David brings the ark to Jerusalem.<p><b>and the holy articles of God</b><br>These articles include items used in worship and sacrifices, such as the altar, lampstand, and table for the showbread, as described in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-30</a>. Their placement in the temple signifies the continuation of the Levitical priesthood and sacrificial system, which foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills and transcends these rituals (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>).<p><b>into the temple that will be built for the Name of the LORD.</b><br>The temple is to be constructed for the Name of the LORD, indicating it is dedicated to His glory and presence. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a name represents one's character and authority. Thus, the temple serves as a testament to God's sovereignty and His chosen relationship with Israel. This dedication prefigures the New Testament understanding of believers as the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>), where God's presence dwells within His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is preparing for the construction of the temple.

Finally, remember it is all for His Name, not ours. When worship, work, and God&#8217;s glory converge, heaven meets earth, and God&#8217;s people become a living temple where He delights to dwell.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">To seek the Lord.</span>--Hebrew, "to seek <span class= "ital">unto the</span> Lord," as in <a href="/2_chronicles/17-4.htm" title="But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.">2Chronicles 17:4</a>; <a href="/ezra/4-2.htm" title="Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as you do; and we do sacrifice to him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up here.">Ezra 4:2</a>. The older construction, with a simple accusative, occurred in <a href="/1_chronicles/16-12.htm" title="Remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;">1Chronicles 16:12</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-30.htm" title="But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.">1Chronicles 21:30</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Arise therefore, and build.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And arise ye, and build.</span> The second clause explains how the first was to be carried out. Building the Lord a fair and noble sanctuary was equivalent to seeking His favour. Professions cost nothing, and they were not to serve the Lord "without cost" (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-24.htm" title="And king David said to Ornan, No; but I will truly buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is your for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.">1Chronicles 21:24</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God</span>. To settle these in a fixed home had now been of a long time the consuming desire of David's heart (so <a href="/1_chronicles/15-1.htm">1 Chronicles 15:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-2.htm">2 Chronicles 5:2-4</a>). Into the house that is to be built. The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, before "the house," is to be noticed here (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-26.htm">1 Chronicles 25:26</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/10-35.htm">Nehemiah 10:35</a>).
