Hadadezer was a king of Zobah, a region in Aram (modern-day Syria). The defeat by Israel under King David's leadership demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel victory over its enemies (<a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3-8</a>). This victory is part of David's broader campaign to establish Israel as a dominant power in the region, fulfilling the Abrahamic covenant of land and blessing (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The defeat also signifies the divine favor upon David, as God had chosen him to lead Israel and establish a kingdom that would foreshadow the eternal reign of Christ (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>they made peace with David and became subject to him</b><br>The making of peace and subjugation to David indicates a shift in political alliances and power dynamics. In the ancient Near East, such treaties often involved tribute payments and military support. This peace treaty reflects the wisdom and diplomacy of David, who not only conquered but also secured his borders through strategic alliances. This act of submission can be seen as a type of the ultimate peace and submission that will be realized in the Messianic kingdom, where all nations will acknowledge the sovereignty of Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>).<p><b>So the Arameans were unwilling to help the Ammonites anymore</b><br>The Arameans' decision to cease supporting the Ammonites underscores the effectiveness of David's military campaigns and the fear they instilled in surrounding nations. The Ammonites, who had initially instigated conflict with Israel by humiliating David's envoys (<a href="/1_chronicles/19.htm">1 Chronicles 19:1-5</a>), found themselves isolated. This withdrawal of support highlights the consequences of opposing God's anointed king, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. It also serves as a reminder of the futility of resisting God's plans, as seen in the broader biblical narrative where God's purposes prevail despite human opposition (<a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hadadezer.htm">Hadadezer</a></b><br>A king of Zobah, a region in Aram (modern-day Syria), who was defeated by King David's forces.
