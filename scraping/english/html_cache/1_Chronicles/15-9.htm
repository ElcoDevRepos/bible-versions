Hebron was a significant city in the history of Israel, located in the hill country of Judah. It was a city of refuge and a Levitical city, indicating its importance in religious and legal matters. The Hebronites' role in the transportation and care of the Ark of the Covenant highlights their dedication to the sacred duties assigned to the Levites.<p><b>Eliel the chief</b><br>Eliel, meaning "My God is God," was a leader among the Hebronites. His position as chief suggests he was responsible for organizing and overseeing the duties of his relatives in the service of the Ark. Leadership among the Levites was crucial for maintaining order and ensuring the proper observance of religious practices. Eliel's role underscores the importance of godly leadership in fulfilling divine mandates.<p><b>and 80 of his relatives</b><br>The mention of 80 relatives indicates a significant family group dedicated to the service of the Lord. This number reflects the large extended families typical in ancient Israelite society, where kinship ties were strong and often determined one's role and responsibilities. The involvement of such a large group in the procession of the Ark emphasizes the communal nature of worship and the collective responsibility of the Levites in their sacred duties.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebron.htm">Hebron</a></b><br>A significant city in the history of Israel, often associated with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

By specifying this clan, Scripture underscores God&#8217;s orderly design for worship: only Levites were to carry the ark (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>). David&#8217;s inclusion of the Hebronites shows his deliberate return to God&#8217;s stated pattern after the earlier failure at Perez-uzza (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-7.htm">1 Chronicles 13:7-10</a>). Just as Moses relied on Hebronites for tabernacle duties in the wilderness, David now trusts them for the ark&#8217;s relocation, reinforcing continuity in covenant worship (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-60.htm">1 Chronicles 6:60-61</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eliel the chief</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;Eliel the chief.&#8221; Leadership among Levites mattered. Eliel&#8217;s name appears elsewhere in David&#8217;s mighty men lists (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-11.htm">1 Chronicles 12:11</a>), hinting at proven faithfulness. By calling him &#8220;chief,&#8221; the text highlights accountability: a recognized leader guarantees the task is done &#8220;according to the word of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-15.htm">1 Chronicles 15:15</a>). This pattern mirrors earlier models&#8212;Eleazar son of Aaron supervising tabernacle transport (<a href="/numbers/3-32.htm">Numbers 3:32</a>) and later Jeshua the high priest guiding post-exilic worship (<a href="/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a>). God raises specific leaders so His people can follow with confidence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and 80 of his relatives</b><p>Finally, &#8220;and 80 of his relatives&#8221; emphasizes corporate participation. The number is large enough to bear the ark poles but small enough for unified purpose, paralleling the 80 priestly trumpeters at Solomon&#8217;s temple dedication (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>). Scripture often records head counts to show that God notices every servant (<a href="/numbers/4-48.htm">Numbers 4:48</a>; <a href="/ezra/8-18.htm">Ezra 8:18-20</a>). These relatives stand shoulder to shoulder, modeling family solidarity in ministry (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>). Their willingness corrects the earlier oversight when non-Levites handled the ark, reminding us that obedience is not optional but shared.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/15-9.htm">1 Chronicles 15:9</a> highlights three truths: God assigns specific families for sacred tasks, He appoints trustworthy leaders, and He values every willing participant. By naming the Hebronites, elevating Eliel, and counting 80 relatives, the verse affirms that worship flourishes when God&#8217;s order is embraced and His people serve together in joyful obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Of the sons of Hebron.</span>--Hebron was third son of Kohath (<a href="/exodus/6-18.htm" title="And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years.">Exodus 6:18</a>).
