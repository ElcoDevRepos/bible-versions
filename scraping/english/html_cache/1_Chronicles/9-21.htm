This lineage highlights the hereditary nature of certain Levitical roles, emphasizing the importance of family lines in temple service. Meshelemiah is also mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/26.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1-2</a>, where his family is listed among the gatekeepers, indicating a long-standing tradition of service in the temple. The name Zechariah means "Yahweh remembers," which is significant in the context of Israel's history and God's faithfulness to His covenant people.<p><b>was the gatekeeper</b><br>Gatekeepers held an important role in the temple, responsible for maintaining the sanctity and security of the holy place. They were tasked with controlling access, ensuring that only those who were ceremonially clean could enter. This role can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate gatekeeper, the one who grants access to the Father (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>). The gatekeepers' duties also included guarding the treasures and offerings, highlighting the trust and responsibility placed upon them.<p><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites before the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. It was a central place of worship and sacrifice, symbolizing God's presence with His people. The entrance to the Tent of Meeting was a significant location, as it was the point of transition from the common to the sacred. This phrase underscores the importance of the gatekeeper's role in facilitating worship and maintaining the holiness of the space. The Tent of Meeting is a precursor to the Temple and ultimately points to Jesus Christ, who is the true meeting place between God and humanity (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A Levite and son of Meshelemiah, who served as a gatekeeper at the Tent of Meeting.
