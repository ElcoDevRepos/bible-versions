This action was controversial because it was seen as an expression of pride and reliance on military strength rather than trust in God. The act of numbering the troops was against God's will, as it suggested a lack of faith in His provision and protection. Joab's role here is significant as he often served as a voice of reason to David, though he was not without his own flaws. The reporting of the census results to David highlights the completion of a task that was initiated by the king, despite Joab's initial reluctance and the divine disapproval that would follow.<p><b>In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword,</b><br>The figure of 1,100,000 men indicates the vast military potential of Israel at the time. This number reflects the combined forces of the northern tribes, excluding Judah. The phrase "men who drew the sword" emphasizes their readiness for battle, underscoring the military might of the nation. This census, however, was not just a logistical exercise; it was a spiritual misstep that led to divine judgment. The large number also serves to illustrate the extent of David's kingdom and the prosperity and strength that Israel enjoyed under his rule, yet it also foreshadows the impending consequences of David's actions.<p><b>including 470,000 in Judah.</b><br>Judah, David's own tribe, is singled out with a specific count of 470,000 men. This distinction between Israel and Judah is significant, as it foreshadows the eventual division of the kingdom after Solomon's reign. The separate mention of Judah highlights its importance and centrality in David's reign, as well as its future role in the history of Israel. The tribe of Judah would later become the southern kingdom, maintaining the Davidic line and ultimately leading to the birth of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Lion of the tribe of Judah. This connection to Christ underscores the messianic significance of the tribe and its enduring legacy in biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who ordered the census of the fighting men, an act that later brought consequences upon Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, tasked with carrying out the census, though he did so reluctantly.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The united kingdom under David, consisting of the twelve tribes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The tribe from which David hailed, often highlighted separately due to its significance and size.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/census.htm">Census</a></b><br>The event of counting the fighting men, which was against God's will and led to divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride_and_self-reliance.htm">The Danger of Pride and Self-Reliance</a></b><br>David's decision to count the troops reflects a reliance on human strength rather than God's provision.

The numbers are different in Samuel, which states them as 800,000 for Israel and 500,000 for Judah. The latter may fairly be regarded as a round number (500,000), our text giving the more exact total (470,000). As to the former, we may assume that the 1,100,000 of our text is an error of transcription, or, more probably, that the traditions respecting this census varied, as may easily have happened, inasmuch as the numbers were not registered in the royal archives (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-24.htm" title="Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.">1Chronicles 27:24</a>). Perhaps, however, our estimate includes the standing army of David, reckoned (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/27-1.htm" title="Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in any matter of the courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and four thousand.">1Chronicles 27:1-15</a>) at a total of 288,000 men (in round numbers, 300,000); thus 800,000 (Sam.) + 300,000 = 1,100.000 (Chron.).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The report of the numbers as given in this verse does <span class="accented">not</span> tally with that of the parallel place. Here they are three hundred thousand more for Israel, and thirty thousand fewer for Judah, than there. No really satisfactory explanation of these discrepancies has yet appeared. The somewhat ingenious suggestion that the Chronicle-compiler counted in the standing army (two hundred and eighty-eight thousand, <a href="/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1-15</a>) for Israel, and omitted from Judah a supposed "thirty thousand," under the head of "the thirty" of our ch. 11; while the writer of the Book of Samuel did exactly the converse, - can scarcely pass muster, although it must be noticed that it would meet in the main the exigencies of the case. A likelier suggestion might be found in a comparison of the statements of our ver. 6 compared with <a href="/1_chronicles/27-22.htm">1 Chronicles 27:22-24</a>. Indeed, the last sentence of this last-quoted verse (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a>) may possibly contain the explanation of all (cutup. <a href="/numbers/1-47.htm">Numbers 1:47-50</a>; <a href="/numbers/2-33.htm">Numbers 2:33</a>). That Joab utterly refused to number Levi, because this was a thing most distinctly prohibited (and further because it was not material to David's presumable objects), was quite to be expected. And though Joab is said in the following verse not to have numbered Benjamin, it is possible enough that he may have known this number (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-6.htm">1 Chronicles 7:6-11</a>).
