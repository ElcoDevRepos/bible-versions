The number thirteen here indicates the order of service or division among the musicians appointed by David for the temple worship. The use of the number thirteen may have symbolic significance, often associated with completeness or the fulfillment of a cycle in biblical numerology. Shubael's role in the temple service highlights the importance of organized worship and the dedication of specific families to the service of God.<p><b>his sons, and his brothers&#8212;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the familial nature of the Levitical service. The inclusion of both sons and brothers suggests a communal and generational involvement in temple duties, reflecting the hereditary nature of Levitical roles. It underscores the importance of family in maintaining religious traditions and responsibilities. This structure ensured continuity and stability in worship practices, as seen in other parts of the Old Testament where family lines are crucial for maintaining priestly and Levitical duties.<p><b>12 in all;</b><br>The number twelve is significant throughout the Bible, often representing divine government or authority, as seen in the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles. In this context, the number twelve may symbolize completeness or the full representation of Shubael's family in their service. It indicates a well-organized and complete group ready to fulfill their duties in the temple worship.
