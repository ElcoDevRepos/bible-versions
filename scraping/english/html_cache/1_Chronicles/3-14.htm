His reign was short, lasting only two years (<a href="/2_kings/21-19.htm">2 Kings 21:19-26</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-21.htm">2 Chronicles 33:21-25</a>). Amon continued the idolatrous practices of his father, Manasseh, which included worshiping false gods and neglecting the worship of Yahweh. His reign is marked by a return to the evil practices that Manasseh had initially instituted before his repentance. Amon's assassination by his own servants highlights the instability and moral decline in Judah during this period. His death led to the ascension of his son, Josiah, who would bring significant religious reform.<p><b>and Josiah his son</b><br>Josiah, the son of Amon, became king of Judah at the young age of eight after his father's assassination. His reign is noted for significant religious reforms and a return to the worship of Yahweh (2 Kings 22-23; <a href="/2_chronicles/34.htm">2 Chronicles 34-35</a>). Josiah is remembered for his efforts to restore the temple and for discovering the Book of the Law, which led to a national covenant renewal. His reign is often seen as a bright spot in the history of Judah, as he sought to eliminate idolatry and restore proper worship. Josiah's reforms are seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy given to the unnamed prophet in <a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>, where a king named Josiah would arise to destroy the altars of false gods. His life and reign are often viewed as a type of Christ, as he sought to bring the people back to God and restore true worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amon.htm">Amon</a></b><br>Amon was the son of Manasseh and the father of Josiah.
