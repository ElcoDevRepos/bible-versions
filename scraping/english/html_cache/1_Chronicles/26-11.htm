The mention of Hilkiah as "the second" indicates his position in the family hierarchy, suggesting a structured order among the sons of Hosah. This reflects the importance of lineage and order in the Levitical service, as seen in other parts of the Chronicles where genealogies and family roles are meticulously recorded.<p><b>Tebaliah the third</b><br>Tebaliah, being the third, continues the pattern of listing the sons in order of their birth or importance. The name Tebaliah means "Yahweh is good," which is a testament to the faith and religious devotion of the family. This naming convention underscores the cultural practice of embedding theological significance within personal names, a common practice in ancient Israel.<p><b>Zechariah the fourth</b><br>Zechariah, meaning "Yahweh remembers," is a name shared by several notable figures in the Bible, including a prophet and a priest. The recurrence of this name highlights its popularity and the hope it embodies&#8212;that God remembers His covenant with His people. The position of Zechariah as the fourth son may indicate his role within the family and the duties he might have been expected to perform in the service of the temple.<p><b>The sons and brothers of Hosah numbered 13 in all</b><br>Hosah was a gatekeeper, and his family was part of the Levitical order responsible for the security and maintenance of the temple. The number 13, while not as symbolically significant as other numbers in the Bible, indicates a sizable family unit dedicated to temple service. This reflects the communal and familial nature of worship and service in ancient Israel, where entire families were often involved in religious duties. The role of gatekeepers was crucial, as they ensured the sanctity and order of the temple, a theme that resonates with the broader biblical narrative of maintaining holiness and reverence in worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hilkiah.htm">Hilkiah</a></b><br>The second son of Hosah, a gatekeeper in the temple.

This continuity accents the prophetic and protective role associated with the name.<p>&#8226; Being the &#8220;fourth&#8221; reminds us that even those later in birth order can still stand watch faithfully (cf. <a href="/matthew/20-1.htm">Matthew 20:1&#8211;16</a> where late laborers receive equal honor).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The sons and brothers of Hosah numbered 13 in all</b><p>&#8226; Thirteen may sound minor, yet within the gatekeeper roster it is a sizable team (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-10.htm">1 Chronicles 26:10&#8211;12</a>). God furnished Hosah with a full squad to cover their assigned posts &#8220;by lots&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-13.htm">1 Chronicles 26:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse purposely mentions &#8220;sons and brothers,&#8221; showing that ministry often flourishes when extended family serves side by side (cf. <a href="/ezra/2-41.htm">Ezra 2:41&#8211;42</a>).<p>&#8226; Rather than any superstition about the number 13, Scripture portrays it here as a sign of abundance&#8212;ample hands for watchfulness (compare the 24 priestly courses in <a href="/bsb/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>, the 288 musicians in <a href="/1_chronicles/25-7.htm">1 Chronicles 25:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Their collective presence anticipates the New Testament principle that Christ sends disciples out &#8220;two by two&#8221; for accountability and strength (<a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/26-11.htm">1 Chronicles 26:11</a> records the orderly listing of Hosah&#8217;s four named sons&#8212;Hilkiah, Tebaliah, Zechariah&#8212;and tallies their total clan of thirteen. The Spirit highlights birth order yet shows that every position, regardless of seniority, matters in God&#8217;s house. The verse reinforces themes of divine election, familial faithfulness, and adequate provision for temple service, assuring us that the Lord still appoints and equips each believer for a precise role in His ongoing worship and work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/26-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Hilkiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;il&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2518.htm">Strong's 2518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hilkiah -- 'my portion is Yah', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the second,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
