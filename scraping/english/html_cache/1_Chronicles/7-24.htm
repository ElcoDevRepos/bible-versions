Her inclusion highlights her significance, possibly due to her achievements. In a patriarchal society, her mention suggests she held a notable position or accomplished something extraordinary. This can be seen as a reflection of God's use of both men and women to fulfill His purposes, similar to other prominent women in the Bible like Deborah (Judges 4-5) and Esther.<p><b>who built Lower and Upper Beth-horon</b><br>Beth-horon refers to two towns, Lower and Upper, strategically located on the border of Ephraim and Benjamin. These towns were significant for their military and trade routes, as they controlled the ascent from the coastal plain to the hill country. The construction of these towns by Sheerah indicates her role in establishing and fortifying important locations for the Israelites. This act of building can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate builder of His church (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>). The towns are also mentioned in <a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10-11</a>, where God aids Israel in battle, demonstrating His sovereignty and protection over His people.<p><b>as well as Uzzen-sheerah</b><br>Uzzen-sheerah is likely a town or settlement named after Sheerah herself, indicating her influence and legacy. The naming of a place after an individual was a way to honor their contributions or leadership. This reflects the cultural practice of memorializing significant figures through place names, similar to how cities and landmarks are named today. The mention of Uzzen-sheerah alongside Beth-horon underscores Sheerah's impact on the region and her role in the development of Israelite society. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the eternal legacy believers have in Christ, as they are called to build and leave a lasting impact for God's kingdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheerah.htm">Sheerah</a></b><br>Sheerah is the daughter mentioned in this verse, notable for her accomplishments in building.
