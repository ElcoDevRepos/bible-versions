In the biblical context, "ascribe" means to attribute or give credit. The name of the LORD represents His character and deeds, which are worthy of honor and praise. This call to ascribe glory is a recurring theme in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/29-2.htm">Psalm 29:2</a>) and reflects the understanding that God alone is deserving of worship. The concept of God's name being due glory is rooted in the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where His acts of deliverance and provision are celebrated.<p><b>bring an offering and come before Him.</b><br>In ancient Israel, offerings were a central part of worship and were seen as a tangible expression of devotion and gratitude to God. The act of bringing an offering signifies acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and provision. Historically, offerings included sacrifices of animals, grain, and other goods, which were presented at the Tabernacle or Temple. This practice is connected to the sacrificial system outlined in Leviticus, which foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Coming before God with an offering also implies entering His presence with reverence and humility.<p><b>Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness;</b><br>Worship in this context is an act of reverence and adoration directed towards God. The "splendor of His holiness" highlights the purity, majesty, and otherness of God. Holiness is a defining attribute of God, setting Him apart from all creation. This phrase calls believers to recognize and respond to God's holiness with awe and respect. The idea of worshiping in holiness is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/96-9.htm">Psalm 96:9</a>, and points to the need for worshipers to approach God with clean hands and pure hearts, as seen in <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>. The splendor of God's holiness is ultimately revealed in Jesus Christ, who embodies divine holiness and invites believers into a holy relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel who organized the return of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem and led the people in worship and thanksgiving to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence with His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the Ark was brought, symbolizing the central place of worship for the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The tribe assigned to care for the Ark and lead the people in worship, playing a crucial role in the religious life of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The temporary dwelling place for the Ark before the construction of the Temple, representing God's dwelling among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/ascribing_glory_to_god.htm">Ascribing Glory to God</a></b><br>Recognize that giving glory to God is acknowledging His supreme worth and majesty.
