The listing of these names reflects the chronicler's intent to preserve the lineage and heritage of the tribes of Israel. Jether, Mered, Epher, and Jalon are names that do not have significant roles in biblical narratives, but their inclusion highlights the importance of family and tribal connections in Israelite society. Genealogies in the Bible often serve to establish identity and continuity, linking the present community to its ancestral past.<p><b>And Mered&#8217;s wife Bithiah gave birth to Miriam, Shammai, and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa.</b><br>Bithiah is noted as the wife of Mered, and her name is of Egyptian origin, meaning "daughter of Yah." This suggests a possible connection or influence from Egypt, which is significant given Israel's history with Egypt. The mention of Bithiah may indicate a blending of cultures or alliances through marriage. Miriam, Shammai, and Ishbah are her children, with Ishbah being identified as the father of Eshtemoa. Eshtemoa is a location in the hill country of Judah, mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-50.htm">Joshua 15:50</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/30-28.htm">1 Samuel 30:28</a>, known for its pastoral lands.

The fact of the antithesis of the Jewess wife (by some assigned as wife to Ezra), and the presumably Egyptian wife mentioned in the latter verse, is perhaps just enough in the general obscurity to suggest that Mered, the asserted husband of the latter, is to be understood as the husband of the former also But to compass so much as this, we have to overlook omission in ver. 17 and inversion in ver. 18. There is a tone about the verses, due to names they contain, that might suggest to us the times of Egypt and Moses, and traditions in keeping do not fail to come to view in Jerome ('Quaestiones,' etc.; see also art. "Meted," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary').
