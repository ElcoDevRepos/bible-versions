Hamath was strategically positioned along trade routes, making it an influential city in the ancient Near East. The mention of King Tou indicates the far-reaching impact of David's military campaigns. The news of David's victories would have traveled quickly, affecting neighboring kingdoms. This reflects the interconnectedness of ancient Near Eastern politics and the importance of communication among rulers.<p><b>that David had defeated</b><br>David's military prowess is a recurring theme in the biblical narrative, showcasing his role as a warrior king chosen by God. His victories were seen as divinely ordained, fulfilling God's promises to Israel. David's defeat of his enemies not only secured Israel's borders but also established his reputation as a formidable leader. This phrase highlights the fulfillment of God's covenant with David, promising him success over his adversaries.<p><b>the entire army of Hadadezer</b><br>Hadadezer was a powerful king of Zobah, a region north of Israel. The defeat of his entire army signifies a comprehensive victory, emphasizing David's strategic and military capabilities. This victory would have disrupted the balance of power in the region, weakening Zobah's influence. The complete defeat of Hadadezer's forces underscores the theme of divine intervention and support for David, as seen in other biblical accounts of Israel's battles.<p><b>king of Zobah</b><br>Zobah was an Aramean kingdom located in the region of modern-day Syria. It was a significant power during the time of David, often in conflict with Israel. The mention of Zobah highlights the geopolitical landscape of the time, with various city-states and kingdoms vying for dominance. The defeat of Zobah's king by David not only expanded Israel's territory but also demonstrated the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel rest from its enemies.
