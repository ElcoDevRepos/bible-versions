Genealogies in the Bible often serve to establish the historical and covenantal continuity of God's people. Jaareshiah, Elijah, and Zichri are not widely mentioned elsewhere in Scripture, which highlights the importance of every individual in God's plan, even if they are not prominent figures. The name Elijah, meaning "My God is Yahweh," is shared with the more famous prophet Elijah, suggesting a common cultural or religious significance attached to the name.<p><b>were the sons of Jeroham.</b><br>Jeroham is a name that appears multiple times in the Old Testament, often associated with the tribe of Benjamin. This particular Jeroham is part of the lineage that traces the descendants of Benjamin, one of the twelve sons of Jacob. The genealogical records in 1 Chronicles emphasize the restoration and continuity of Israel's tribes after the Babylonian exile, underscoring God's faithfulness to His covenant people. The mention of Jeroham and his sons serves to affirm the identity and heritage of the Benjaminites within the broader narrative of Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jaareshiah.htm">Jaareshiah</a></b><br>A descendant of Benjamin, Jaareshiah is listed among the sons of Jeroham.

Earlier in the chapter (1 Chron 8:1&#8211;6) the writer carefully lists Benjamin&#8217;s line, anchoring this name in a real family tree that stretches back to Jacob.<p>&#8226; Every entry in the genealogy shows God&#8217;s intimate knowledge of His people, echoing the assurance in <a href="/isaiah/49-16.htm">Isaiah 49:16</a> that He has engraved them on His palms. Jaareshiah&#8217;s quiet appearance reminds us that no servant of God is overlooked, even if history records only a name.<p>&#8226; Together with the parallel list in 1 Chron 9:35&#8211;38, the verse underscores how the post-exilic community verified its roots. God&#8217;s promises to the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17, 26</a>) still stood, and Jaareshiah&#8217;s name is part of that unbroken chain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Elijah</b><p>&#8226; The name immediately calls to mind the famous prophet of <a href="/bsb/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a>, yet this Elijah is a different man. Scripture often repeats names (<a href="/acts/7-8.htm">Acts 7:8-16</a> pairs two men named Joseph), which prevents us from assigning glory to a single individual and keeps the focus on God&#8217;s redemptive thread.<p>&#8226; Including this Elijah affirms that godly legacies can spread beyond one celebrated life. Just as God raised up more than one Joseph, He also raised up more than one Elijah, demonstrating His limitless capacity to work through ordinary believers (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zichri</b><p>&#8226; Zichri&#8217;s brief mention reflects a common biblical pattern: God records people who seem obscure to us but are precious to Him (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>). His placement beside Jaareshiah and Elijah implies partnership in family faithfulness, not personal fame.<p>&#8226; Genealogies like this one provide a backdrop for later Benjamite heroes&#8212;Saul&#8217;s family in <a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a> and Paul&#8217;s heritage in <a href="/romans/11-1.htm">Romans 11:1</a>. Zichri&#8217;s name, though small in our eyes, contributes to a lineage that eventually produces missionaries and kings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were the sons of Jeroham</b><p>&#8226; Jeroham appears in several Benjamite lists (1 Chron 9:8; <a href="/1_samuel/12-11.htm">1 Samuel 12:11</a>), showing how God honors faithful parents by recording their children. <a href="/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a> reminds us that &#8220;the glory of children is their fathers,&#8221; and here the children also bring honor to Jeroham.<p>&#8226; By grouping these sons together, the verse lets us glimpse a household committed to covenant life. Their collective identity testifies that God often works through families, fulfilling <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a> as parents pass truth to the next generation.<p>&#8226; The phrase also highlights continuity. After exile and national upheaval (2 Chron 36:20-23), Israel needed proof that God had preserved families. Listing Jeroham&#8217;s sons verifies that the Lord&#8217;s promises to Benjamin and to Israel as a whole remained intact.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27</a> is more than a roll call; it is a declaration that God remembers every individual and family who belong to Him. Jaareshiah, Elijah, and Zichri&#8212;sons of Jeroham&#8212;stand as witnesses that the Lord keeps covenant, preserves lineage, and values faith passed from parent to child. Their simple listing encourages believers today: God knows our names, secures our place in His story, and weaves our ordinary lives into His extraordinary plan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jaareshiah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1447;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;re&#353;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3298.htm">Strong's 3298: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jaareshiah -- a Benjamite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Elijah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;l&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_452.htm">Strong's 452: </a> </span><span class="str2">Elijah -- 'Yah is God', a well-known prophet of Israel, also three other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Zichri</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1494;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;zi&#7733;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2147.htm">Strong's 2147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Zichri -- the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[were] the sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Jeroham.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1495;&#1464;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#183;&#7717;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3395.htm">Strong's 3395: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jeroham -- 'may He be compassionate', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">OT History: 1 Chronicles 8:27 And Jaareshiah and Elijah and Zichri (1 Chron. 1Ch iCh i Ch 1 chr 1chr)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/1_chronicles/8-26.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="1 Chronicles 8:26"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 8:26" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/1_chronicles/8-28.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="1 Chronicles 8:28"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Chronicles 8:28" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
