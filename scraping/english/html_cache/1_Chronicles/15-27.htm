Fine linen was often used for priestly garments (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-42</a>), symbolizing purity and holiness. This choice of clothing reflects David's desire to honor God and align himself with the Levitical priests during the ark's procession.<p><b>as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark</b><br>The Levites were designated by God to carry the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). Their wearing of fine linen underscores their sacred duty and the importance of the ark, which represented God's presence among His people. This moment marks a return to proper worship practices, as earlier attempts to move the ark had failed due to neglect of these divine instructions (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-9.htm">1 Chronicles 13:9-10</a>).<p><b>as well as the singers</b><br>The inclusion of singers highlights the role of music in worship and celebration. Music was integral to Israelite worship, often used to express joy and reverence (Psalm 150). The singers' participation in this event underscores the communal and celebratory nature of bringing the ark to Jerusalem.<p><b>and Chenaniah, the director of music for the singers</b><br>Chenaniah's role as director indicates an organized and structured approach to worship. His leadership in music reflects the importance of skilled and orderly worship, as seen in other biblical instances where music played a crucial role in spiritual life (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12-13</a>). This organization points to the value placed on worship that is both heartfelt and excellently executed.<p><b>David also wore a linen ephod</b><br>The linen ephod was a priestly garment (<a href="/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18</a>), and David wearing it signifies his role as a spiritual leader, though he was not a Levite. This act prefigures Christ, who is both King and Priest (<a href="/hebrews/7-17.htm">Hebrews 7:17</a>). David's wearing of the ephod symbolizes his heart for worship and his desire to lead the nation in honoring God, bridging the roles of king and priest in a manner that points to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is leading the procession to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.

The robe was not distinctively a priest's garment (<a href="/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/24-5.htm">1 Samuel 24:5, 12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-18.htm">2 Samuel 13:18</a>; <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>), though priests did wear it. The robe of byssus is spoken of only here; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>; and <a href="/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>. <span class="accented">Byssus</span>, however, is spoken of as material for other purposes in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-21.htm">1 Chronicles 4:21</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>; <a href="/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>. The <span class="accented">ephod</span>, on the other hand, was no doubt distinctively a high priest's garment (<a href="/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4-12</a>), though we read of Samuel wearing one (<a href="/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18, 28</a>), and of David doing the same, as on this occasion. The fine linen (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;</span>), in the first clause of this verse, is not the same with that (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5da;</span>) in the last clause. The first clause of this verse (which makes the last clause somewhat redundant) bears some resemblance in letters to the <a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a> <span class="bible_ref">fourteenth verse</span> of 2 Samuel 6. first clause, which means, "and David danced with all his might," and the two clauses exactly answer to one another in position - another suggestion of an uncertain text here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/15-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;w&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
