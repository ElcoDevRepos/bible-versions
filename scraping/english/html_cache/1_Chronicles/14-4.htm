Jerusalem, also known as the City of David, became the capital after David conquered it from the Jebusites. This city holds a central place in biblical history and prophecy, being the site of the future temple and the eternal city in eschatological visions.<p><b>Shammua,</b><br>Shammua is the first son listed, and his name means "heard" or "announced." While not much is known about Shammua himself, his inclusion in the list signifies the continuation of David's lineage. The name reflects a common biblical theme of God hearing and responding to His people, as seen in other biblical figures with similar names.<p><b>Shobab,</b><br>Shobab, whose name means "rebellious" or "backsliding," is another son of David. The name might reflect the tumultuous nature of David's family life, marked by internal strife and rebellion, as seen in the later actions of some of his children. This highlights the human aspect of biblical figures, who, despite their divine calling, faced personal and familial challenges.<p><b>Nathan,</b><br>Nathan, meaning "gift" or "given," is significant not only as David's son but also as a name associated with the prophet Nathan, who played a crucial role in David's life. The prophet Nathan confronted David about his sin with Bathsheba and later supported Solomon's claim to the throne. This connection underscores the theme of divine grace and forgiveness, as well as the prophetic voice guiding Israel's kings.<p><b>Solomon,</b><br>Solomon, whose name means "peaceful," is perhaps the most well-known of David's sons. He succeeded David as king and is renowned for his wisdom, wealth, and the building of the First Temple in Jerusalem. Solomon's reign is seen as a foreshadowing of the Messianic kingdom, characterized by peace and prosperity. His wisdom is celebrated in the books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon, and he is a type of Christ, the ultimate King of Peace. Solomon's birth is also significant in the context of God's promise to David of an everlasting dynasty, fulfilled ultimately in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, David is the king of Israel who established his reign in Jerusalem.

The growing family reflected the peace of Jerusalem that <a href="/bsb/psalms/122.htm">Psalm 122</a> celebrates.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nathan</b><p>&#8226; Nathan stands out because the Gospel of Luke traces Mary&#8217;s lineage back to David through this very son (<a href="/luke/3-31.htm">Luke 3:31</a>). God was already weaving redemption history, ensuring the Messiah would come from David&#8217;s line even apart from Solomon&#8217;s royal branch (<a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The presence of Nathan in the list assures readers that God&#8217;s promises extend beyond immediate circumstances, reaching all the way to Christ&#8217;s birth centuries later (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; For David personally, Nathan&#8217;s birth reinforced the prophetic word spoken by the prophet Nathan in <a href="/2_samuel/7-4.htm">2 Samuel 7:4&#8211;17</a>&#8212;the name itself becomes a living reminder of that oracle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Solomon</b><p>&#8226; Solomon, the fourth name, would eventually inherit the throne (<a href="/1_kings/2-12.htm">1 Kings 2:12</a>) and build the temple his father dreamed of (<a href="/1_kings/5-3.htm">1 Kings 5:3&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>). His presence in this early list points forward to the fulfillment of the promise, &#8220;I will raise up your offspring&#8230; and I will establish his kingdom&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>).<p>&#8226; God gave Solomon a special name at birth&#8212;Jedidiah, &#8220;loved by the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24&#8211;25</a>)&#8212;showing divine favor and forgiveness after David&#8217;s earlier failure with Bathsheba. Even our sins, when repented of, do not cancel God&#8217;s overarching plan (<a href="/bsb/psalms/32.htm">Psalm 32</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s later wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29&#8211;34</a>) and temple construction signaled a foretaste of Christ, the true Son of David who is greater than Solomon (<a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>) and who would build a living temple of believers (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/14-4.htm">1 Chronicles 14:4</a> is more than a genealogical note. By naming Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, the verse records God&#8217;s faithfulness to establish David securely in Jerusalem, to multiply his family, and to advance the covenant that would culminate in Jesus Christ. Each child marks a step in God&#8217;s unfolding plan: new beginnings (Shammua), ongoing stability (Shobab), messianic lineage through Mary (Nathan), and future royal glory and temple worship (Solomon). In a single sentence, Scripture quietly affirms that every promise God makes, He keeps&#8212;down to every name and every generation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">His children.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the born.</span> Samuel has a different word from the same root, and omits the relative pronoun and its verb.
