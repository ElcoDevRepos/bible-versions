His name means "sorrow" or "pain," which may reflect the circumstances of his birth. The act of calling out to the God of Israel indicates a deep faith and reliance on God, a common theme throughout the Old Testament. This phrase highlights the personal relationship between Jabez and God, emphasizing prayer as a means of communication with the divine. The God of Israel is a title that underscores God's covenant relationship with His people, reminding readers of the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>&#8220;If only You would bless me</b><br>The request for blessing is a recurring theme in biblical prayers, reflecting a desire for divine favor and provision. Blessings in the Old Testament often include prosperity, health, and success, but they also carry a spiritual dimension, indicating God's presence and approval. This phrase echoes the patriarchal blessings found in Genesis, where figures like Abraham and Jacob sought God's favor for themselves and their descendants.<p><b>and enlarge my territory!</b><br>In the historical context, land was a critical component of wealth and security. The request to enlarge territory can be seen as a desire for increased influence and responsibility. It may also reflect the fulfillment of God's promise to Israel regarding the land. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God's people expanding and flourishing under His guidance, as seen in the conquest narratives of Joshua.<p><b>May Your hand be with me</b><br>The hand of God is a metaphor for His power and presence. In the Bible, God's hand is often associated with deliverance and protection, as seen in the Exodus story. This request signifies a desire for God's guidance and strength in all endeavors. It reflects a dependence on divine intervention rather than human effort alone, aligning with the biblical principle that success comes from God.<p><b>and keep me from harm</b><br>This plea for protection is a common element in biblical prayers, reflecting the reality of a world filled with dangers and adversities. The request to be kept from harm can be seen as a desire for both physical safety and spiritual integrity. It resonates with the Lord's Prayer in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches His disciples to ask for deliverance from evil.<p><b>so that I will be free from pain.&#8221;</b><br>The mention of pain ties back to Jabez's name, creating a personal and poignant request. It suggests a desire for relief from suffering and a life marked by peace and well-being. This phrase can be seen as a broader metaphor for the human condition and the hope for redemption and restoration, themes that are fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ.<p><b>And God granted the request of Jabez.</b><br>This concluding statement highlights God's responsiveness to sincere prayer and faith. It serves as a testament to the power of prayer and God's willingness to bless those who earnestly seek Him. The granting of Jabez's request can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises and a demonstration of His faithfulness, encouraging believers to trust in God's provision and care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jabez.htm">Jabez</a></b><br>A man noted for his prayer to God, seeking blessing and protection.

He invokes it, and depends upon it. His language implies the confidence that he had in the reality of providential blessing. For the expression, enlarge my coast, see <a href="/deuteronomy/12-20.htm">Deuteronomy 12:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-8.htm">Deuteronomy 19:8</a>; and though we know nothing as matter of fact about the occasion of this prayer, we may assume that it was one when not selfishness and greed of larger territory, but just opportunity, had awakened a strong desire for enlargement of borders. It may have been a legitimate occasion of recovering his own, lost or wrongfully taken from him or his predecessors before him, or of expelling successfully from their hold upon it a portion of the original inhabitants of the promised land of God's people. That thine hand might be with me. Many are the beautiful parallels to be culled from the Word of God for this expression, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-17.htm">Psalm 80:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-173.htm">Psalm 119:173</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-5.htm">Psalm 139:5, 10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>. And that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! This, the last entreaty of the prayer, is the largest and most far-seeing. Warned by his own name, forewarned by his mother's emphasizing of her own pains in him, he thus concludes. Having begun in the evil of pain and excessive sorrow, he prays that he and his career may not so determine and end. He does not necessarily pray to be preserved from all suffering, but from such baneful touch of evil itself, its principle, its tyrannous, merciless hold, as might bring him to real and irreparable grief. Thus closes the whole prayer, each succeeding clause of which has been under the rule of the initial "if," translated with us, Oh that. This well-known Hebrew form of prayer supposes a solemn engagement, and that the answered prayer shall meet with the fulfilment of a vowed promise on the part of the suppliant, according to the pattern of <a href="/genesis/28-20.htm">Genesis 28:20</a>. In the absence of that engagement here, we may notice, with Keil, the greater grace of the passage, in that it closes with the statement of the readiness to <span class="accented">hear</span>, and the abounding readiness to <span class="accented">answer</span>, on the part of Divine beneficence: And God granted him that which he requested. Evidently the thing that he asked pleased the Lord (<a href="/1_kings/3-10.htm">1 Kings 3:10, 12</a>); although it was in this case some form of riches, and long life for self, and the life of his enemies, that he asked, and was <span class="accented">not</span> altogether and in so many words "a wise and understanding heart." Perhaps, also there was in the way of asking, and in the exact occasion, unknown to us, something which quite justified the matter of the prayer, and which thus pleased the Lord. The remarkable and arresting episode could not have closed in more welcome or impressive way than when it is thus briefly but conclusively said, "And God granted him that which he requested." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Jabez</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1440;&#1506;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#8216;&#183;b&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3258.htm">Strong's 3258: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jabez -- a descendant of Judah, also a place in Judah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">called out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
