This event occurs during a time when the Philistines, a perennial enemy of Israel, had encamped in Bethlehem, David's hometown. The act of breaking through the Philistine camp demonstrates not only the courage of these warriors but also their deep commitment to David. This reflects the broader biblical theme of loyalty and sacrifice, reminiscent of Jonathan's loyalty to David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>).<p><b>drew water from the well at the gate of Bethlehem</b><br>The well at Bethlehem's gate was significant, likely a central and well-known source of water for the town. Bethlehem, meaning "house of bread," is also the birthplace of David and later Jesus Christ, making it a place of prophetic importance. The act of drawing water from this well symbolizes a connection to David's roots and heritage. In a spiritual sense, water often represents life and sustenance in the Bible, paralleling Jesus' offer of "living water" in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>.<p><b>and brought it back to David</b><br>The journey back to David with the water signifies the completion of a perilous mission, underscoring the dedication of the Three to their leader. This act of bringing water can be seen as a type of offering, reflecting the biblical principle of giving one's best to God or a leader, as seen in the offerings described in Leviticus.<p><b>But he refused to drink it</b><br>David's refusal to drink the water is a profound act of reverence and humility. It shows his recognition of the sacrifice made by his men and his unwillingness to benefit from their risk. This mirrors the biblical theme of self-denial and the idea that true leadership involves putting others before oneself, as exemplified by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>.<p><b>instead, he poured it out to the LORD</b><br>Pouring the water out to the LORD transforms the act into a libation, a type of offering. This gesture signifies David's acknowledgment that the bravery of his men and the water itself are gifts from God. It reflects the biblical practice of offering sacrifices to God as a sign of worship and gratitude, similar to the drink offerings described in <a href="/numbers/28-7.htm">Numbers 28:7</a>. This act can also be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, where His life is poured out for the salvation of humanity (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who is in the stronghold and expresses a longing for water from the well of Bethlehem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_three_mighty_warriors.htm">The Three Mighty Warriors</a></b><br>These are part of David's elite group of warriors, known for their bravery and loyalty.

His elite warriors&#8212;same &#8220;Three&#8221; described in <a href="/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13&#8211;17</a>&#8212;hear David&#8217;s longing for water from his hometown. Undeterred by enemy lines, they launch a daring raid, mirroring earlier episodes where God&#8217;s people faced Philistine aggression (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6&#8211;15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1&#8211;54</a>). Their courage underscores steadfast loyalty to God&#8217;s anointed king&#8212;loyalty that reflects the call for God&#8217;s people to stand firm even when opposition looks overwhelming (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They draw water from the well at Bethlehem&#8217;s gate</b><p>Bethlehem&#8217;s gate well is no ordinary cistern; it is the very source David drank from as a boy. By securing that water, the Three reclaim a place the Philistines had seized, much as later generations would reclaim territory during Nehemiah&#8217;s rebuilding (<a href="/nehemiah/4-14.htm">Nehemiah 4:14&#8211;20</a>). The act foreshadows Jesus&#8217; offering of &#8220;living water&#8221; in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10&#8211;14</a>&#8212;water that satisfies deepest thirst. Yet here the water also represents the cost of devotion; every drop is won at the risk of life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They bring the water to David</b><p>With the same single-minded service that characterized Ruth&#8217;s commitment in <a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16&#8211;17</a>, these men place the precious water in David&#8217;s hands. Their gift says, &#8220;Nothing is too risky when our king desires it.&#8221; It illustrates Paul&#8217;s later exhortation in <a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a> to be &#8220;poured out like a drink offering&#8221; for Christ&#8217;s sake. What moves David most is not the water itself but the self-sacrifice behind it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>David pours the water out to the LORD</b><p>&#8220;Far be it from me before my God to do this,&#8221; David insists (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-19.htm">1 Chronicles 11:19</a>). Seeing the water as the blood of his men, he treats it as holy and offers it as a libation, the way Moses poured out drink offerings in <a href="/numbers/28-7.htm">Numbers 28:7&#8211;8</a>. David&#8217;s act acknowledges that only the LORD is worthy of such costly devotion (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>; <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). This moment teaches that when human loyalty reaches its pinnacle, it must be redirected upward so that God alone receives the glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>1 Ch 11:18 highlights heroic loyalty to God&#8217;s king, the reclaiming of what the enemy holds, and the truth that the highest sacrifices belong to the LORD alone.
