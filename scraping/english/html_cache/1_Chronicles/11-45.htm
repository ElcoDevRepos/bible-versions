The name Jediael means "God makes known" or "God knows," reflecting a common biblical theme of divine knowledge and revelation. Shimri, his father, is not widely mentioned elsewhere, indicating that Jediael's prominence comes from his own deeds rather than his lineage. This highlights the biblical principle that God often raises individuals from obscurity to fulfill His purposes, as seen with David himself, who was chosen from among his brothers.<p><b>and his brother Joha the Tizite</b><br>Joha is identified as Jediael's brother, suggesting a family of warriors dedicated to David's cause. The term "Tizite" likely refers to their place of origin, though the exact location is not specified in the biblical text. This detail emphasizes the diverse backgrounds of David's followers, who came from various tribes and regions to support his kingship. The inclusion of brothers in the list of mighty men underscores the importance of family loyalty and unity in achieving God's plans, reminiscent of other biblical sibling pairs who worked together for a common purpose, such as Moses and Aaron.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jediael.htm">Jediael</a></b><br>A warrior listed among David's mighty men.
