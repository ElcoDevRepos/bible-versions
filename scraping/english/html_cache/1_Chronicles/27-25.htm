The mention of lineage underscores the importance of family heritage and tribal affiliations in Israelite society. The royal storehouses were critical for the administration of the kingdom, storing resources such as grain, oil, and other goods necessary for the sustenance of the royal household and the military. This role required trustworthiness and organizational skills, reflecting the structured governance under King David. The position highlights the centralized economic system in ancient Israel, which was essential for maintaining the king's power and supporting the nation.<p><b>Jonathan son of Uzziah was in charge of the storehouses in the country, in the cities, in the villages, and in the fortresses.</b><br>Jonathan, meaning "Yahweh has given," is identified as the son of Uzziah. His responsibility extended beyond the royal storehouses to those spread throughout the land, indicating a decentralized system of resource management. This distribution network ensured that resources were available across various regions, supporting local populations and military outposts. The mention of cities, villages, and fortresses suggests a comprehensive infrastructure that facilitated trade, defense, and sustenance. This system reflects the administrative sophistication during David's reign, ensuring stability and prosperity. The fortresses, in particular, highlight the strategic importance of resource allocation for defense purposes, a theme recurrent in biblical narratives where God provides for His people in times of need.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azmaveth_son_of_adiel.htm">Azmaveth son of Adiel</a></b><br>He was responsible for the king's treasuries, indicating a position of significant trust and responsibility within King David's administration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan_son_of_uzziah.htm">Jonathan son of Uzziah</a></b><br>He managed the treasuries located in various regions, including the countryside, cities, villages, and watchtowers, suggesting a decentralized system of resource management.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king's_treasuries.htm">King&#8217;s Treasuries</a></b><br>These were the central repositories of wealth and resources for the kingdom, crucial for the administration and functioning of the state.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/treasuries_in_the_country,_cities,_villages,_and_watchtowers.htm">Treasuries in the Country, Cities, Villages, and Watchtowers</a></b><br>This indicates a well-organized system of resource management spread throughout the kingdom, ensuring that resources were available where needed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david's_administration.htm">King David&#8217;s Administration</a></b><br>The context of this verse is within the broader organization of King David's kingdom, highlighting the structured and efficient governance during his reign.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_trust.htm">Stewardship and Trust</a></b><br>The roles of Azmaveth and Jonathan highlight the importance of stewardship and trustworthiness in managing resources.

These were the king&#8217;s own treasuries&#8212;grain, oil, wine, metals, and other resources housed near the palace (compare <a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/32-28.htm">2 Chronicles 32:28</a>, which mention similar royal reserves).<p>&#8226; By naming Azmaveth, the text underlines personal responsibility. Just as the priests were gatekeepers of the temple treasures in <a href="/1_chronicles/26-20.htm">1 Chronicles 26:20&#8211;22</a>, Azmaveth stewarded the king&#8217;s supplies. God&#8217;s people have always been called to faithful oversight (<a href="/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42&#8211;44</a>).<p>&#8226; Central storehouses ensured that national worship, royal hospitality, and military needs were met without interruption. <a href="/proverbs/21-20.htm">Proverbs 21:20</a> commends such foresight: &#8220;Precious treasure and oil are in a wise man&#8217;s dwelling.&#8221; David&#8217;s realm was secure because dependable men guarded tangible blessings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jonathan son of Uzziah was in charge of the storehouses in the country, in the cities, in the villages, and in the fortresses</b><p>&#8226; The verse widens the lens: Jonathan supervised everything outside the palace&#8212;storehouses &#8220;in the country, in the cities, in the villages, and in the fortresses.&#8221; This four-part list shows how resources were dispersed across Judah and Israel, ready for daily life and for crisis. Joseph&#8217;s strategy in <a href="/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48</a>, storing grain in every city, provides an earlier parallel.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Fortresses&#8221; hints at military readiness (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12</a>). David prepared not only worship but national defense, mirroring the balance Nehemiah later practiced: building walls while storing provisions (<a href="/nehemiah/4-16.htm">Nehemiah 4:16&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Delegation is evident: two different men, two complementary roles. David knew that &#8220;plans succeed with many advisers&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>). Unity of purpose came through varied assignments, echoing Paul&#8217;s body metaphor in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4&#8211;6</a>.<p>&#8226; On a personal level, the text invites believers to manage both the &#8220;central&#8221; and the &#8220;scattered&#8221; resources God entrusts&#8212;our finances, time, skills at home and in public life (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23&#8211;24</a>). Faithfulness in each sphere honors the Lord who owns it all (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/27-25.htm">1 Chronicles 27:25</a> records two real officials under David, illustrating ordered stewardship: Azmaveth guarded the palace storehouses, while Jonathan oversaw distributed supplies throughout the land. God values practical organization, personal accountability, and wise preparation so that His people can worship, serve, and defend the nation. By naming these men, Scripture shows that faithfulness in seemingly mundane tasks is remembered by God and essential to His kingdom purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">III.--THE TWELVE OVERSEERS OF THE ROYAL ESTATES AND</span> PROPERTY (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/27-25.htm" title="And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah:">1Chronicles 27:25-31</a>).<p>The number of these officers is noticeable, twelve being a normal number in Israelite institutions.<p>(25) <span class= "bld">And over the king's treasures.</span>--That is, those of the palace on Zion.<p><span class= "bld">And over the storehouses.</span>--The Hebrew has the same word "treasures."

(See for some illustration of this verse also, Sallust., 'De Belle Jugurth.,' 12.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/27-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Azmaveth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1494;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1430;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;az&#183;m&#257;&#183;we&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5820.htm">Strong's 5820: </a> </span><span class="str2">Azmaveth -- 'strong (one) of death', four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Adiel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5717.htm">Strong's 5717: </a> </span><span class="str2">Adiel -- 'God is an ornament', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was in charge of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
