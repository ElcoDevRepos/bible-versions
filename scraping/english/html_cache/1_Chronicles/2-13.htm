Jesse lived in Bethlehem, a town with deep historical and prophetic significance, as it is the prophesied birthplace of the Messiah (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). Eliab, as the firstborn, would traditionally hold a place of prominence and responsibility in the family. However, despite his stature and appearance, God chose David, the youngest, to be king, illustrating the biblical theme that God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>Abinadab was born second,</b><br>Abinadab, the second son of Jesse, is mentioned in the context of the anointing of David. Like Eliab, Abinadab was passed over by God when Samuel was sent to anoint the next king of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-8.htm">1 Samuel 16:8</a>). This highlights the divine selection process that defies human expectations and emphasizes God's sovereignty in choosing leaders. Abinadab also participated in the battle against the Philistines, where David famously defeated Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-13.htm">1 Samuel 17:13</a>).<p><b>Shimea third,</b><br>Shimea, also known as Shammah in some biblical texts (<a href="/1_samuel/16-9.htm">1 Samuel 16:9</a>), is the third son of Jesse. His mention in the genealogical record underscores the importance of family lineage in the biblical narrative, particularly in the context of the Davidic line. The listing of Jesse's sons serves to establish the historical and familial background of David, Israel's greatest king, and ultimately points to the messianic lineage culminating in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Son of David" (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesse.htm">Jesse</a></b><br>Jesse is the father of King David and is a significant figure in the lineage of Jesus Christ.

Yet, by preserving their names without attaching lasting royal honor, the verse quietly points to God&#8217;s surprising choice of David. The genealogy reminds us that while human society esteems the firstborn and the strong, the LORD accomplishes His redemptive plan through whomever He wills, exalting faith and obedience over position or pedigree.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_chronicles/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-15</span> give us what we have not elsewhere, the names of the fourth, fifth, and sixth sons of Jesse, viz. <span class="cmt_word">Nathaneel, Raddai</span> (but see <a href="/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8</a>), and <span class="cmt_word">Ozem</span>. But, on the other hand, they make it appear that David was the seventh of seven, instead of (<a href="/1_samuel/14-10.htm">1 Samuel 14:10, 11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-12.htm">1 Samuel 17:12</a>) the eighth of eight sons. The missing son, any way, belongs to the seventh place. The Syriac and Arabic versions have taken the Elihu of <a href="/1_chronicles/27-18.htm">1 Chronicles 27:18</a>, and put him in this place. Others, following the Septuagint, suppose this Elihu, if strictly a brother of David, to be Eliab, the oldest. The explanation of the absence of the name here may be that he died early and without issue, and would accordingly be the less wanted in a genealogical register. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jesse</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#353;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
