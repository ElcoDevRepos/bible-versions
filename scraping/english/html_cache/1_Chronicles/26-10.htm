The Merarites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle's frames, bars, pillars, and bases, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/3-36.htm">Numbers 3:36-37</a>. This lineage highlights the importance of the Levitical duties and the hereditary nature of these roles. The mention of Hosah's sons indicates the continuation of these responsibilities through his lineage.<p><b>Shimri the first (although he was not the firstborn, his father had appointed him as the first):</b><br>Shimri's appointment as the first, despite not being the firstborn, is significant. In ancient Israelite culture, the firstborn son typically held a place of preeminence and received a double portion of the inheritance (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>). However, there are biblical precedents for the younger being chosen over the elder, such as Jacob over Esau (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>) and Ephraim over Manasseh (<a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14-19</a>). This choice by Hosah may reflect a recognition of Shimri's capabilities or character, aligning with the biblical theme that God's purposes often transcend human customs and expectations. This decision underscores the principle that leadership and responsibility in God's service are based on divine appointment rather than mere birth order.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosah.htm">Hosah</a></b><br>A Levite from the family of Merari, one of the three main divisions of the Levites.

Hosah belongs to the clan of Merari, one of Levi&#8217;s three sons (<a href="/numbers/3-17.htm">Numbers 3:17</a>). The Merarites were charged with carrying the heavy frames and bases of the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/4-29.htm">Numbers 4:29-33</a>), so Hosah&#8217;s family lineage is one of faithful, physical service in God&#8217;s house. His name turns up earlier when David assigns gatekeepers (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-38.htm">1 Chronicles 16:38</a>), underscoring a life already invested in worship ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>also had sons</b><p>Genealogies in Chronicles are never filler; they spotlight God&#8217;s faithfulness to every generation. By noting that Hosah &#8220;also had sons,&#8221; the writer links Hosah&#8217;s line to the expanding team that guarded the temple gates (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-1.htm">1 Chronicles 26:1-9</a>). Sons meant continuity, future laborers, and covenant blessing (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shimri the first</b><p>The text says, &#8220;Shimri the first,&#8221; immediately marking Shimri as chief among Hosah&#8217;s sons, much like &#8220;Chelub was the firstborn&#8221; in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9</a>. In Levitical service, being listed first signified leadership responsibility (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-31.htm">1 Chronicles 24:31</a>; 25:1-2). Shimri would have received the primary gatekeeping post and coordinated his brothers&#8217; assignments.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>although he was not the firstborn</b><p>Here comes the surprise. Birth order did not dictate God&#8217;s choice. Scripture is filled with similar reversals&#8212;Jacob over Esau (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>), Ephraim over Manasseh (<a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14-20</a>), and Solomon over Adonijah (<a href="/1_kings/1-30.htm">1 Kings 1:30</a>). Chronicles highlights that divine callings transcend human convention (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his father had appointed him as the first</b><p>Hosah, exercising fatherly and Levitical authority, &#8220;appointed him as the first.&#8221; Leadership in God&#8217;s house must be Spirit-recognized and parent-affirmed (<a href="/numbers/3-32.htm">Numbers 3:32</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-1.htm">1 Chronicles 23:1</a>). Hosah evidently discerned qualities in Shimri&#8212;faithfulness, readiness, perhaps spiritual zeal&#8212;that outweighed simple primogeniture. In the same way, David appointed the sons of Jeduthun &#8220;for the service of song&#8221; according to ability, not birth order (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-8.htm">1 Chronicles 25:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/26-10.htm">1 Chronicles 26:10</a> teaches that God&#8217;s work depends on calling and character, not mere chronology. Hosah&#8217;s Merarite heritage affirms a legacy of service; his &#8220;sons&#8221; extend that legacy; Shimri&#8217;s elevation shows that God&#8217;s order sometimes upends ours; and Hosah&#8217;s deliberate appointment models responsible, Spirit-led leadership in the family and in God&#8217;s house.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Also Hosah, of the children of Merari.</span>--Four chiefs of the sons of Hosah are named, and thirteen assigned as the total number of families belonging to this clan (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/26-10.htm" title="Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;)">1Chronicles 26:10-11</a>).
