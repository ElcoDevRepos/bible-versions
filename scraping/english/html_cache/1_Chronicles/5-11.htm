Gad's descendants were known for their warrior skills and played a significant role in Israel's military campaigns. In <a href="/genesis/49-19.htm">Genesis 49:19</a>, Jacob prophesied that Gad would be attacked by a band of raiders, but he would retaliate and pursue them. This prophecy highlights the tribe's resilience and martial prowess.<p><b>lived next to the Reubenites</b><br>The Reubenites were descendants of Reuben, Jacob's firstborn son. Both the tribes of Gad and Reuben chose to settle on the east side of the Jordan River, outside the Promised Land, because the land was suitable for their large herds and flocks (<a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32:1-5</a>). This decision was made during the time of Moses, and it required a commitment from these tribes to assist the other Israelites in conquering Canaan before returning to their own territories (<a href="/numbers/32-16.htm">Numbers 32:16-22</a>).<p><b>in the land of Bashan</b><br>Bashan was a fertile region known for its rich pastures and strong cattle, located east of the Jordan River. It was part of the territory conquered by the Israelites under Moses' leadership, specifically from King Og of Bashan (<a href="/deuteronomy/3.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1-11</a>). The land's fertility made it an attractive settlement for tribes with significant livestock, such as Gad and Reuben.<p><b>as far as Salecah</b><br>Salecah, also known as Salkhad, was a city on the eastern boundary of Bashan. It marked the extent of the territory occupied by the Gadites. The city's location is significant as it demonstrates the expansive reach of the tribe of Gad's territory. Salecah is mentioned in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/joshua/13-11.htm">Joshua 13:11</a>, which outlines the boundaries of the land allocated to the tribes east of the Jordan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_gad.htm">Sons of Gad</a></b><br>The tribe of Gad was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Gad, the seventh son of Jacob and Zilpah, Leah's maidservant.

Gad was born seventh in order of all the sons of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/30-9.htm">Genesis 30:9-12</a>), and first of the children of Leah's maid Zilpah. The compiler seems to pass easily on to Gad, from the mere circumstance of the name of the tribe being so constantly linked with that preceding, in the matter of local settlement on the east of Jordan, after the journeyings of the wilderness (<a href="/joshua/13-7.htm">Joshua 13:7, 8</a>). The geography in vers. 11 and 16 offers very little difficulty. Compared with the time of the first settling of the Gadites (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10-13</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25, 30</a>), it is evident that they had pushed their borders further to the north, trenching somewhat upon the lot of the half-tribe Manasseh, as <span class="accented">they</span> also in turn extended their limits northward to Hermon (ver. 23). This reconciles <a href="/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a> with the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">Salcah</span>, or (Authorized Version) Salchah (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-11.htm">Joshua 13:11</a>), is probably to be identified as the modern <span class="accented">Sulkhad</span>, at the extreme eastern point of the plain <span class="accented">Hauran</span>, which is bordered by the desert. "In Gilead in Bashan" may be read, with some, as two coordinate places, separating them by a stop; or may point to a time when Bashan included the upper half of Gilead. Sharon, which Keil, quoting Reland, 'Pal. Ill.,' 370, would make the well-known Sharon of Carmel and the Mediterranean, is, though unmentioned elsewhere, probably distinguished sufficiently from it by the absence of the article, which is invariably prefixed to the other. Stanley's suggestion ('Sinai and Palestine,' edit. 1866, pp. 484, 485, 260) would seem exceedingly apt, that it is one in fact, as one in derivation and meaning, with the <span class="accented">Mishor</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "level ]ands," "table-land") of Gilead and Bashan. With this explanation, however, the term "suburbs" does not so well agree. Upon the other side, distant as the well-known Sharon is, a link of connection might be found with it, in that the other Manasseh half-tribe stretched into its plains; and in that case the last word of the verse, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, might mean (<a href="/joshua/17-9.htm">Joshua 17:9</a>) "the outgoings" of the land or regions in question to the "sea"-coast. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/5-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The descendants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
