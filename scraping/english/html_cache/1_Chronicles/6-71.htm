The Levites were set apart for religious duties and did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. Instead, they were given specific cities and surrounding pasturelands to support their needs. This allocation underscores the importance of the Levites in Israelite society, serving as priests and caretakers of the tabernacle.<p><b>From the clan of the half-tribe of Manasseh:</b><br>The half-tribe of Manasseh refers to the division of the tribe of Manasseh, one of Joseph's sons, into two groups. One half settled east of the Jordan River, and the other half settled west. This division is significant as it highlights the unique inheritance of Joseph's descendants, who received a double portion through his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. The allocation of cities to the Levites from this tribe emphasizes the cooperative relationship between the tribes and the Levites.<p><b>They were given Golan in Bashan:</b><br>Golan was one of the cities of refuge, designated as a safe haven for those who accidentally committed manslaughter. Located in the region of Bashan, east of the Jordan River, Golan was part of the territory conquered by the Israelites under Moses and later distributed by Joshua. Bashan was known for its fertile land and strong cattle, making it a valuable area for pasturelands. The inclusion of a city of refuge in the Levites' inheritance highlights their role in administering justice and mercy.<p><b>And also Ashtaroth:</b><br>Ashtaroth, also known as Ashtaroth-Karnaim, was a significant city in Bashan. It was associated with the worship of the Canaanite goddess Astarte, indicating the syncretistic religious practices that the Israelites often encountered. The city's inclusion in the Levitical inheritance suggests a strategic placement of the Levites to counteract pagan influences and promote the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>Together with their pasturelands:</b><br>The pasturelands provided for the Levites were essential for their sustenance, as they did not have a tribal territory to cultivate. These lands allowed them to raise livestock and support their families while fulfilling their religious duties. The provision of pasturelands reflects God's care for the Levites, ensuring they had the necessary resources to serve the community and maintain the tabernacle or temple services.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gershonites.htm">Gershonites</a></b><br>A Levitical family descended from Gershon, the son of Levi.

As Levites, they did not receive a large tribal territory but towns scattered among Israel. God personally assigned them their inheritance, underscoring His faithfulness to provide for those set apart for His service (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-33.htm">Joshua 13:33</a>). <a href="/bsb/1_chronicles/6.htm">1 Chronicles 6</a> repeats these allotments to show that the covenant promises were literally fulfilled, down to each family of priests.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the clan of the half-tribe of Manasseh</b><p>Half of Manasseh settled east of the Jordan (<a href="/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29-31</a>). Out of that eastern region, specific towns were set aside for the Gershomites. The precise mention of &#8220;half-tribe&#8221; underlines God&#8217;s orderly distribution&#8212;no tribe, even one divided by geography, was exempt from caring for the servants of the tabernacle (<a href="/joshua/21-27.htm">Joshua 21:27</a>). It also highlights Israel&#8217;s unity; Levites lived among all the tribes so worship would remain central nationwide (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they were given Golan in Bashan</b><p>Golan, situated in the rich plateau of Bashan (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-33.htm">2 Kings 10:33</a>), was already famous as a city of refuge (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-43.htm">Deuteronomy 4:43</a>; <a href="/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>). By placing Levites there, God anchored spiritual leadership where justice and mercy met. Whenever an Israelite fled to Golan, priests were on hand to teach God&#8217;s law, reinforcing that refuge was rooted in divine grace, not mere geography (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a> alludes to such cities as images of Christ).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and also Ashtaroth</b><p>Ashtaroth (also called Ashteroth-Karnaim, <a href="/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>) was once an Amorite stronghold subdued under Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-4.htm">Deuteronomy 1:4</a>). Handing this town to the Gershomites displayed God&#8217;s triumph over paganism and His intention to replace idolatrous centers with true worship (<a href="/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>; 13:31). The Levites&#8217; presence turned former enemy territory into a beacon of holiness, echoing God&#8217;s promise that the knowledge of the Lord would spread throughout the land (<a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>together with their pasturelands</b><p>Pasturelands, or &#8220;open lands,&#8221; surrounded each Levitical town (<a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2-5</a>). These fields supplied food for livestock, enabling Levites to focus on ministry rather than survival (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a> reflects the same principle). The detail proves God&#8217;s provision was practical and complete; He equips His servants spiritually and materially (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>). By integrating these green belts within every tribe&#8217;s territory (<a href="/joshua/21-41.htm">Joshua 21:41</a>), He reminded Israel daily of the priority of worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/6-71.htm">1 Chronicles 6:71</a> records, with precision, how God gave the Gershomite Levites two strategic cities&#8212;Golan and Ashtaroth&#8212;along with their surrounding fields from the eastern half-tribe of Manasseh. Each phrase testifies that the Lord literally fulfilled His covenant promises, placed spiritual leaders across the nation, turned conquered territory into centers of true worship, and cared for His servants&#8217; needs. The verse may seem like a simple land deed, yet it reveals God&#8217;s meticulous faithfulness and His desire that every corner of Israel know, teach, and live His truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_chronicles/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">THE CITIES OF THE GERSHONITES.</span><p>(Camp. <a href="/context/joshua/21-27.htm" title="And to the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.">Joshua 21:27-33</a>.) <a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-71.htm" title="To the sons of Gershom were given out of the family of the half tribe of Manasseh, Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, and Ashtaroth with her suburbs:">1Chronicles 6:71-76</a>.<p>(71) <span class= "bld">Unto the</span> <span class= "bld">sons of Gershom.</span>--Supply <span class= "ital">they gave,</span> from <a href="/1_chronicles/6-67.htm" title="And they gave to them, of the cities of refuge, Shechem in mount Ephraim with her suburbs; they gave also Gezer with her suburbs,">1Chronicles 6:67</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Golan in</span> <span class= "bld">Bashan</span> (comp. the classical Gaulanitis, a district east of the sea of Galilee) was a city of refuge, like Hebron and Shechem.<p><span class= "bld">Ashtaroth.</span>--<span class= "ital">Images of Ashtoreth</span> (Astarte, queen of heaven); a name like Anathoth (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-60.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Benjamin; Geba with her suburbs, and Alemeth with her suburbs, and Anathoth with her suburbs.
