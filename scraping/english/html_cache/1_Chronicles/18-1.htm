It suggests a continuation of David's military campaigns to secure Israel's borders and fulfill God's promises to the nation. The timing is significant as it shows David's strategic approach to dealing with Israel's enemies.<p><b>David defeated the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were long-standing enemies of Israel, often depicted as a formidable military force. David's victory over them is a fulfillment of God's promise to deliver Israel from its enemies. This victory is also a continuation of David's earlier successes against the Philistines, including his famous defeat of Goliath. The defeat signifies God's favor upon David and his role as a warrior king.<p><b>subdued them</b><br>Subduing the Philistines implies not just a military victory but also establishing control over them, reducing their threat to Israel. This subjugation is part of David's broader campaign to bring peace and stability to the region. It reflects the biblical theme of God's chosen leader bringing order and justice.<p><b>and took Gath and its villages</b><br>Gath was one of the five major Philistine cities and the hometown of Goliath. Capturing Gath and its surrounding villages was a significant strategic victory, as it weakened the Philistine power base. Archaeological evidence suggests Gath was a large and fortified city, indicating the scale of David's achievement. This conquest demonstrates David's military prowess and God's provision for Israel.<p><b>from the hand of the Philistines</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the transfer of control from the Philistines to Israel. It highlights the reversal of fortunes, as the Philistines had previously oppressed Israel. The victory is seen as an act of divine intervention, fulfilling God's covenant promises to Israel. It also prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ over spiritual enemies, as David is often seen as a type of Christ, the ultimate King who defeats sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his military prowess, leadership, and heart for God.

Its literal signification is "the bridle or curb of the mother city," and may mark a special strong position which commanded Gath, or it may describe Gath as owning itself to such a position. Gesenius understands it to mean that David "subjected the metropolis of the Philistines to himself," quoting the Arabian proverb, To <span class="accented">give</span> one s bridle to any one, as equivalent to submitting to him.
