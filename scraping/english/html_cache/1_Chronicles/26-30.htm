The Levites were set apart for religious duties and service in the tabernacle and later the temple. Hebron, their ancestral city, was located in the hill country of Judah, a significant location in biblical history, being associated with figures like Abraham and David. The Hebronites' role highlights the importance of Levitical service in maintaining the spiritual and administrative order of Israel.<p><b>Hashabiah and his relatives</b><br>Hashabiah is noted as a leader among the Hebronites. His name means "Yahweh has considered" or "Yahweh has regarded," reflecting a common practice of the time to incorporate the name of God into personal names, signifying devotion and identity. The mention of his relatives indicates a family-based structure of leadership, which was typical in ancient Israelite society, where family ties often determined roles and responsibilities.<p><b>1,700 capable men</b><br>The number 1,700 signifies a substantial group, indicating the significant responsibility and trust placed in Hashabiah and his relatives. The term "capable" suggests that these men were not only numerous but also skilled and competent, likely in both administrative and religious duties. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where those who are faithful and able are entrusted with greater responsibilities.<p><b>had charge of the affairs of Israel west of the Jordan</b><br>This phrase indicates a specific geographical jurisdiction. The area west of the Jordan River was the heartland of Israel, including key tribal territories. The Hebronites' oversight of this region underscores their importance in the administration of the nation. This area was central to Israel's identity and history, being the land promised to Abraham and his descendants.<p><b>for all the work of the LORD</b><br>The "work of the LORD" refers to religious duties, including temple service, teaching the law, and maintaining the spiritual life of the nation. The Levites, including the Hebronites, were integral to these tasks, ensuring that worship and adherence to God's commandments were upheld. This phrase emphasizes the sacred nature of their responsibilities, aligning with the biblical theme of holiness and dedication to God.<p><b>and for the service of the king</b><br>In addition to religious duties, the Hebronites also served the king, indicating a dual role in both spiritual and civil administration. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's governance, where religious and political spheres were intertwined. The king, as God's anointed leader, required support from the Levites to govern according to divine principles, highlighting the unity of religious and royal authority in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebronites.htm">Hebronites</a></b><br>A clan within the tribe of Levi, specifically descended from Hebron, a son of Kohath.

The Hebronites came from Levi and were therefore set apart for ministry. Their mention underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness in keeping His promises to Levi&#8212;that his descendants would serve close to sacred things (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-1.htm">1 Chronicles 6:1, 54</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hashabiah and his relatives</b><p>Next we meet &#8220;Hashabiah and his relatives.&#8221; The text singles out a leader and his kin because God appoints specific people to specific tasks (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-30.htm">1 Chronicles 24:30&#8211;31</a>). Hashabiah&#8217;s name appears earlier among worship leaders (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-3.htm">1 Chronicles 25:3</a>), showing that leadership involves both spiritual and administrative service. By grouping him with his relatives, the verse highlights shared responsibility, echoing how Nehemiah later organized families to rebuild Jerusalem&#8217;s walls (<a href="/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>1,700 capable men</b><p>&#8220;1,700 capable men&#8221; tells us God values competence and counts those who serve (<a href="/numbers/1-44.htm">Numbers 1:44&#8211;46</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-13.htm">2 Chronicles 26:13</a>). These men were not merely numerous; they were &#8220;capable,&#8221; meaning proven in character and skill (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>). The specific number shows divine order, reminding us that ministry is never haphazard but structured for effectiveness (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Had charge of the affairs of Israel west of the Jordan</b><p>Their jurisdiction was &#8220;the affairs of Israel west of the Jordan.&#8221; While some Levites served east of the river (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-31.htm">1 Chronicles 26:31&#8211;32</a>), this group handled matters on the western side&#8212;the larger, more populated region promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). That geographic focus illustrates how God distributes responsibilities so every community receives care (<a href="/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For all the work of the LORD</b><p>Their first assignment: &#8220;all the work of the LORD.&#8221; This includes maintaining the tabernacle&#8217;s treasures, overseeing offerings, and ensuring worship ran smoothly (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28&#8211;32</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/35-3.htm">2 Chronicles 35:3</a>). By tying administrative tasks to &#8220;the work of the LORD,&#8221; the text reminds us that even routine duties are sacred when done for Him (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23&#8211;24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And for the service of the king</b><p>They also served &#8220;the king,&#8221; likely David in context. This dual role shows no conflict between serving God and honoring rightful authority (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>). David&#8217;s reign was God-appointed, so assistance to the throne was an extension of obedience to the Lord (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-20.htm">1 Chronicles 29:20&#8211;22</a>). Their example anticipates New Testament teaching that believers can advance God&#8217;s purposes through secular structures (<a href="/acts/26-19.htm">Acts 26:19&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/26-30.htm">1 Chronicles 26:30</a> portrays a well-organized team of Levites&#8212;rooted in a faithful family line, led by Hashabiah, numbering 1,700 strong&#8212;entrusted with administrative oversight west of the Jordan.
