It served as a refuge for David during his time of fleeing from King Saul. The men who came to David at Ziklag were part of a growing group of supporters who recognized David's anointing and future as king. This gathering of men at Ziklag signifies a pivotal moment in David's rise to power, as it marks the consolidation of his forces and the loyalty of those who believed in his God-given destiny.<p><b>while he was still banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish</b><br>David's banishment from Saul's presence was a result of Saul's jealousy and fear of David's growing popularity and success, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/18-7.htm">1 Samuel 18:7-9</a>. Saul's pursuit of David forced him into exile, where he lived as a fugitive.

The occasion referred to is evidently that recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1, 2, 6, 7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1, 26</a>; and generally in those and the intermediate chapters. David stayed at Ziklag a year and four months, a period which closed for him with the death of Saul. Ziklag, in Joshus's original allotment, was the possession of Simeon (<a href="/joshua/19-5.htm">Joshua 19:5</a>). It was situated south of Judah, and came into the hands of Judah when Achish made it a gift to David for a rest-deuce (<a href="/1_samuel/27-5.htm">1 Samuel 27:5-7</a>). The site of it has not been identified in later times. It witnessed one of the narrowest and most remarkable of the escapes of David, on an occasion which brought danger, not so much from acknowledged foes, as from the maddened grief and despair of his own friends and people (<a href="/1_samuel/30-3.htm">1 Samuel 30:3-6</a>). The whole scene of the broken-hearted grief of David and his people, when, on discovering the successful raid of the Amalekites upon Ziklag, "they lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep," is one of the most dramatic on record. The rapid reverse to good fortune, when David turns away their heedless anger against himself and proposal to stone him, by pursuing and overcoming the enemy, and recovering their captives and their goods near the brook Besor, completes the effectiveness of the scene. The <span class="accented">middle voice</span> form of expression in this verse, kept himself close, means to say that David was, by fear of Saul and by force of his enemies, more or less hemmed up in Ziklag. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_chronicles/12-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now these [were] the [men]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
