The use of multiple terms emphasizes the completeness and perfection of God's nature. "Greatness" refers to God's unmatched superiority and sovereignty. "Power" highlights His omnipotence, seen in creation and His acts throughout history. "Glory" is often associated with God's presence, as seen in the Shekinah glory in the tabernacle and temple. "Splendor" and "majesty" convey the beauty and honor of God, reminiscent of royal imagery, which is fitting given the context of King David's reign. This echoes the worship found in <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>, where God is praised for His creation and sovereignty.<p><b>for everything in heaven and on earth belongs to You</b><br>This phrase underscores God's ownership and dominion over all creation. It reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty, as seen in <a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>, "The earth is the LORD's, and everything in it." The phrase also connects to the creation narrative in Genesis, where God is the Creator of heaven and earth. This ownership implies stewardship for humanity, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where humans are given dominion to manage God's creation. It also points to the ultimate reconciliation of all things under Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-20</a>.<p><b>Yours, O LORD, is the kingdom</b><br>This acknowledges God's eternal kingship, a central theme in the Bible. The concept of God's kingdom is both present and future, as seen in the Lord's Prayer, "Your kingdom come" (<a href="/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>). It reflects the theocratic ideal where God is the ultimate ruler, as Israel was meant to be a nation under God's direct rule. This anticipates the Messianic kingdom, where Jesus, the Son of David, will reign eternally, fulfilling prophecies like those in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.<p><b>and You are exalted as head over all</b><br>This phrase affirms God's supreme authority and leadership. The term "exalted" indicates God's position above all earthly and heavenly powers. It is a reminder of God's ultimate authority, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where Jesus is exalted and every knee will bow to Him. The idea of God as "head over all" is a theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing His control and governance over the universe, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>, where Christ is described as head over everything for the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel who is offering a prayer of praise and thanksgiving to God as he prepares for the building of the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, to whom David is speaking and for whom he is preparing the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_preparation.htm">Temple Preparation</a></b><br>The context of this verse is David's preparation for the building of the temple, which his son Solomon would eventually construct.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple would be built, serving as the spiritual center for Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure of this verse, acknowledged as the sovereign ruler over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_god's_sovereignty.htm">Acknowledging God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that everything in heaven and on earth belongs to God.
