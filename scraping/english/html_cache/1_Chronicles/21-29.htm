It was constructed under the guidance of Moses as described in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-31</a>. The tabernacle served as the central place of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites during their wilderness journey and until the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. It symbolized God's presence and covenant with His people.<p><b>that Moses had made in the wilderness</b><br>Moses, under divine instruction, led the construction of the tabernacle during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt. This period was marked by God's direct guidance and provision, as well as the establishment of the Law. The wilderness experience was a formative time for Israel, teaching reliance on God and obedience to His commands.<p><b>and the altar of burnt offering</b><br>The altar of burnt offering was a key component of the tabernacle, used for sacrifices that atoned for sin and expressed devotion to God. It was made of acacia wood and overlaid with bronze, as described in <a href="/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>. The sacrifices offered on this altar foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself for the sins of humanity.<p><b>were presently at the high place in Gibeon</b><br>Gibeon was a significant city located northwest of Jerusalem. After the conquest of Canaan, the tabernacle and the altar were moved to Gibeon, which became a central place of worship during the reigns of David and Solomon. High places were often associated with worship in ancient Israel, though they later became sites of idolatry. The presence of the tabernacle in Gibeon highlights the transitional period before the establishment of the Temple in Jerusalem, which would become the permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant and the center of Israelite worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle_of_the_lord.htm">The Tabernacle of the LORD</a></b><br>Originally constructed by Moses in the wilderness, this was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, containing the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader who led the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness, receiving the Law from God and overseeing the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_of_burnt_offering.htm">The Altar of Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A significant part of the Tabernacle where sacrifices were made to God, symbolizing atonement and worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_place_at_gibeon.htm">The High Place at Gibeon</a></b><br>A significant worship site during this period, where the Tabernacle and the altar were located before the construction of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who sought to build a permanent temple for God, but was instructed that his son Solomon would complete this task.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_continuity_of_worship.htm">The Continuity of Worship</a></b><br>The presence of the Tabernacle at Gibeon underscores the continuity of worship practices from the wilderness to the establishment of the monarchy.

&#8220;Tabernacle&#8221; points to God&#8217;s portable dwelling among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8&#8211;9</a>; 40:34&#8211;38).<p>&#8226; Even though centuries had passed, the writer treats the structure as fully authoritative and functional&#8212;proof that God honors what He has prescribed.<p>&#8226; The verse opens with &#8220;For,&#8221; explaining why David offered sacrifices on Araunah&#8217;s threshing floor instead of traveling elsewhere (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26&#8211;28</a>).<p>&#8226; The tabernacle&#8217;s continued existence underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness; what He once established still matters until He Himself moves worship forward (<a href="/2_chronicles/1-5.htm">2 Chronicles 1:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Moses had made in the wilderness</b><p>&#8226; By naming Moses, the chronicler ties present worship back to Sinai, rooting David&#8217;s actions in the unbroken line of covenant history (<a href="/exodus/33-7.htm">Exodus 33:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-50.htm">Numbers 1:50</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds readers that what began in tents would one day culminate in Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-4.htm">1 Kings 8:4</a>).<p>&#8226; It also highlights that genuine worship never depends on buildings alone but on obedient hearts responding to revealed truth (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the altar of burnt offering</b><p>&#8226; The altar Moses built (<a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1&#8211;8</a>) was still the authorized place for atoning sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Burnt offerings dramatized total surrender to God, their smoke rising &#8220;as a pleasing aroma&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/1-17.htm">Leviticus 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s emergency altar on the threshing floor did not replace this one permanently; it met an immediate need under divine instruction (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-18.htm">1 Chronicles 21:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The coexistence of two altars for a brief time illustrates God&#8217;s willingness to meet His people where they are, while still upholding His established means of grace (<a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were presently at the high place in Gibeon</b><p>&#8226;

A &#8220;high place&#8221; was an elevated site commonly used for worship; in Gibeon&#8217;s case, it housed the legitimate tabernacle, not an idolatrous shrine (<a href="/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The Ark, however, was already in Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>). This split worship center reveals a transitional moment: the old order waits in Gibeon while the future temple site awaits Solomon on Mount Moriah (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s choice to sacrifice near Jerusalem rather than travel to Gibeon shows pastoral urgency and prophetic anticipation of worship&#8217;s eventual centralization in the temple (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/21-29.htm">1 Chronicles 21:29</a> explains why David did not go to the established sanctuary in Gibeon: the ancient tabernacle and Moses&#8217; bronze altar were there, while the Ark was already in Jerusalem.
