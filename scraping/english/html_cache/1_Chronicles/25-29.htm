The division into twenty-four groups reflects a structured and organized approach to worship, emphasizing the importance of order in the service of God. This system mirrors the division of the priestly courses found in <a href="/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>, suggesting a parallel between the roles of priests and musicians in temple worship.<p><b>to Giddalti:</b><br>Giddalti is one of the sons of Heman, a prominent musician in King David's court. Heman is noted for his wisdom and musical talent, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/25-5.htm">1 Chronicles 25:5</a>, where he is described as the king's seer in the words of God.
