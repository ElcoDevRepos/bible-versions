His lineage traces back to Aaron, making him a legitimate priest according to the Levitical line. Zadok's loyalty to David during Absalom's rebellion and his support for Solomon's succession highlight his faithfulness and integrity. His role as a priest foreshadows the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ, who is both King and Priest.<p><b>a mighty young man of valor</b><br>This description emphasizes Zadok's strength and courage, qualities highly valued in the ancient Near Eastern culture. The term "mighty man of valor" is often used in the Old Testament to describe warriors and leaders who exhibit exceptional bravery and skill in battle. This phrase indicates that Zadok was not only a spiritual leader but also a capable and courageous figure, embodying the ideal of a warrior-priest.<p><b>with 22 commanders from his own family</b><br>The mention of 22 commanders suggests a significant and influential family, indicating that Zadok's family held considerable power and responsibility. In the tribal and familial structure of ancient Israel, such a number of leaders from one family underscores the prominence and respect commanded by Zadok's lineage. This familial support reflects the importance of kinship ties in maintaining social and military cohesion. The number 22 may also have symbolic significance, as numbers often do in biblical texts, though its specific meaning here is not explicitly detailed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zadok.htm">Zadok</a></b><br>A prominent priest during the time of King David, known for his loyalty and bravery.
