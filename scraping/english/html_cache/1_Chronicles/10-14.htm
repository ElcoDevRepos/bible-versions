In the biblical context, inquiring of the LORD was a common practice for leaders, as seen with David (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2, 4</a>; 30:8). Saul's failure contrasts with David's reliance on God, emphasizing the importance of divine guidance. This neglect is also a reflection of Saul's spiritual decline, as he had previously disobeyed God's commands (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>). The cultural context of the time placed great importance on seeking divine will through prophets or the Urim and Thummim, which Saul did not do.<p><b>So the LORD put him to death</b><br>This phrase indicates divine judgment upon Saul. His death is portrayed as a direct consequence of his disobedience and failure to seek God. Theologically, it underscores the principle that God holds leaders accountable for their actions. Saul's demise fulfills Samuel's prophecy (<a href="/1_samuel/28-17.htm">1 Samuel 28:17-19</a>) and serves as a warning about the consequences of turning away from God. Historically, Saul's death in battle against the Philistines (1 Samuel 31) marks the end of his troubled reign and the beginning of a new era for Israel.<p><b>and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.</b><br>This phrase signifies the divine transfer of kingship from Saul to David, aligning with God's earlier anointing of David (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>). David, described as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>), represents a new covenantal leadership. Theologically, this transfer highlights God's sovereignty in establishing rulers and fulfilling His promises. David's kingship is a type of Christ, foreshadowing Jesus as the ultimate King from David's lineage (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). This transition also marks a significant shift in Israel's history, as David's reign brings unity and expansion to the kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Repeated episodes show him acting first and praying later&#8212;or not at all (<a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8-14</a>; 14:18-19, 36-37).<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a> notes that Saul &#8220;inquired of the LORD,&#8221; but when God was silent he ran to a medium (28:7-20). His heart was already set on getting answers his own way, not on waiting for God&#8217;s voice (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine inquiry involves humble trust and obedience (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>). Saul wanted God&#8217;s help without submitting to God&#8217;s rule.<p>&#8226; Chronicling the kings centuries later, the writer highlights this single failure&#8212;&#8220;he failed to inquire of the LORD&#8221;&#8212;as the root cause of everything that followed (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-12.htm">2 Chronicles 16:12</a> shows a similar warning in Asa&#8217;s life).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the LORD put him to death</b><p>&#8226; Saul died by falling on his own sword (<a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4-6</a>), yet Scripture is clear that his death was ultimately God&#8217;s judgment. Human actions and divine sovereignty met on the same battlefield (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier disobedience had already sealed the sentence: &#8220;Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has rejected you as king&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>). <a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a> had predicted that the LORD would hand Saul and Israel over to the Philistines &#8220;and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The Chronicler stresses that God&#8217;s verdict was just. Saul chose rebellion; the LORD responded with righteous discipline (<a href="/1_chronicles/10-13.htm">1 Chronicles 10:13</a>, &#8220;Saul died for his unfaithfulness to the LORD&#8221;).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s actions here warn every generation that ignoring Him is not a harmless option (<a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16-17</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse</b><p>&#8226; The same sovereign hand that removed Saul lifted David.

God disciplined the nation by removing Saul, then blessed it by giving a shepherd-king &#8220;who cared for them with a heart of integrity&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-72</a>).<p>&#8226; For readers today, the transfer underscores both God&#8217;s right to depose and His grace to install leaders who will pursue His heart (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Saul&#8217;s story in <a href="/1_chronicles/10-14.htm">1 Chronicles 10:14</a> is a sobering reminder that sidelining God leads to ruin. Because Saul would not truly seek the LORD, the LORD judged him, ending his life and dynasty. Yet the same verse shines with hope: God&#8217;s purposes moved forward as He placed the kingdom in the hands of David, the forerunner of the Messiah. Obedient inquiry brings life; stubborn independence invites loss.

His character is consistently drawn throughout the history. The sin that ruined the first king was essentially that which led to the final ruin of the nation, viz., unfaithfulness to the covenant-God. The same word characterises both.
