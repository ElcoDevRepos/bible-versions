Quail are migratory birds, and their appearance in the Sinai Peninsula is consistent with natural patterns, as they often migrate across this region. This event is a miraculous provision, as the quail came in such abundance that they covered the camp, ensuring that the Israelites had enough to eat. This provision of quail is also mentioned in <a href="/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31-32</a>, where it is described in greater detail. The quail can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the Bread of Life, providing sustenance to His people. The timing of the quail's arrival in the evening parallels the Passover lamb, which was also prepared in the evening, pointing to the sacrificial provision of Christ.<p><b>and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp</b><br>The morning dew is significant as it sets the stage for the appearance of manna, the bread from heaven. Dew in the Bible often symbolizes blessing and divine favor (<a href="/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>, <a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>). The dew around the camp is a precursor to the miraculous provision of manna, which would sustain the Israelites throughout their 40 years in the wilderness. This daily provision of manna is a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ, who refers to Himself as the true bread from heaven in <a href="/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32-35</a>. The consistency and reliability of the manna, appearing with the dew each morning, underscore God's faithfulness and the importance of daily dependence on Him for sustenance. The dew's presence also emphasizes the freshness and purity of God's provision, as it was new every morning, much like the mercies of God (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Leaders appointed by God to guide the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_sin.htm">The Wilderness of Sin</a></b><br>The geographical location where the Israelites camped and experienced God's provision of quail and manna.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/q/quail.htm">Quail</a></b><br>Birds provided by God as a source of meat for the Israelites in the evening.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/dew.htm">Dew</a></b><br>The morning moisture that preceded the appearance of manna, symbolizing God's provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>God provides for our needs in unexpected ways, just as He provided quail and manna for the Israelites.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>The Israelites received quail in the evening and manna in the morning, teaching us to trust in God's perfect timing for provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contentment_and_gratitude.htm">Contentment and Gratitude</a></b><br>The Israelites' experience reminds us to be content and grateful for God's daily provisions, avoiding the temptation to grumble or complain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites depended on God for daily sustenance, we are called to rely on Him for our spiritual and physical needs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>The provision of quail and manna came with specific instructions, teaching us the importance of obedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_16_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 16:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_16_13_God_s_provision_proof.htm">How does Exodus 16:13 demonstrate God's provision for the Israelites' needs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Trust_lessons_from_Exodus_16_13.htm">What lessons about trust can we learn from God's actions in Exodus 16:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_16_13_Jesus_as_Bread_of_Life.htm">How does Exodus 16:13 connect to Jesus as the Bread of Life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Exodus_16_13_daily.htm">How can we apply God's provision in Exodus 16:13 to our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_16_13_God_s_aid_in_need.htm">What does Exodus 16:13 teach about God's faithfulness in times of need?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_16_13_God_s_provision_proof_2.htm">How does Exodus 16:13 demonstrate God's provision for the Israelites in the wilderness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_do_quail_appear_in_Exodus_16_13.htm">What is the significance of quail appearing in Exodus 16:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_16_13_Reliance_on_God.htm">How does Exodus 16:13 relate to the theme of reliance on God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_was_quail's_role_in_the_bible.htm">What role did quail play in the biblical narrative?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_did_1m_israelites_survive_40_years.htm">How could over a million Israelites survive in the desert for 40 years without leaving archaeological evidence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_signs_and_wonders.htm">What does the Bible say about signs and wonders?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_did_israelites_survive_without_bread.htm">(Deut 29:6) If the Israelites lacked basic provisions like bread and wine, how did they realistically survive in the harsh desert environment?

Exhausted after a long flight over the Red Sea, the flocks drop to the ground as soon as they reach the coast, and it is then easy either to take the birds with the hand or to kill them with sticks. Diodorus says that "the inhabitants of Arabia Petraea were wont to prepare long nets, and spread them near the coast for many furlongs, by which means they caught a great quantity of quails, which were in the habit of coming in from the sea" (ii. 60), The flesh of the quail is regarded as a delicacy throughout the East, though if too many are eaten it is said to be unwholesome.<p><span class= "bld">The dew lay.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">there was a lying of dew. </span>A heavy fall seems to be meant.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The quails came up</span>. The word here translated, "quails" has been supposed to designate the flying-fish (<span class="accented">Trigla Israelitarum</span> of Ehrenberg), or a species of locust (Ludolf). But <a href="/psalms/78-28.htm">Psalm 78:28</a>, makes it clear that "feathered fowls" are intended; and moderns generally, are agreed that the rendering "quails" is right. It has the authority of the Septuagint, of Josephus, and of the Vulgate. Diodorus says that "the inhabitants of Arabia Petraea prepared long nets, spread them near the coast for many stadia, and thus caught a great number of quails which are in the habit of coming in from the sea" (2:60). The quail regularly migrates from Syria and Arabia in the autumn, and winters in the interior of Africa, whence it returns northwards in immense masses in the spring (Schubert, <span class="accented">Reise</span>, vol. 2. p. 361). Kalisch thinks that the particular species of quail intended is the kata of the Arabs (<span class="accented">Tetrao</span> <span class="accented">Alchata</span> of Linnaeus); but the common quail (<span class="accented">Tetrao coturnix</span>) is preferred by most commentators. When these birds approach the coast after a long flight over the Red Sea, they are often so exhausted that they rather fall to the ground than settle, and are then easily taken by the hand or killed with sticks. Their flesh is regarded by the natives as a delicacy. <span class="cmt_word">Covered the camp</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, covered all the ground between the tents in which the Israelites lived in the wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">The dew lay</span>.
