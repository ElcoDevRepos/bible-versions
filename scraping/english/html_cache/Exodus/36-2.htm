This highlights the importance of leadership in recognizing and mobilizing God-given talents within a community. Bezalel, from the tribe of Judah, and Oholiab, from the tribe of Dan, represent the unity of different tribes working together for a common purpose. This gathering of skilled individuals reflects the communal effort required to build the Tabernacle, a central place of worship for the Israelites during their wilderness journey.<p><b>whom the LORD had gifted&#8212;</b><br>The phrase underscores the belief that all skills and talents are gifts from God. In the context of the Tabernacle's construction, it emphasizes divine involvement in the project, ensuring that the work is not just a human endeavor but a divinely inspired one. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where spiritual gifts are given by the Holy Spirit for the edification of the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>). The acknowledgment of God's gifting serves as a reminder of the source of all abilities and the purpose they serve in His plans.<p><b>everyone whose heart stirred him to come and do the work.</b><br>This phrase highlights the voluntary nature of the work on the Tabernacle. It was not merely a duty but a response to an inner prompting, suggesting a heartfelt commitment to God's service. This willingness to serve is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God values the condition of the heart over mere external compliance (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). The stirring of the heart can be seen as a type of the work of the Holy Spirit, who moves believers to act according to God's will. This voluntary service prefigures the New Testament call for believers to offer themselves as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

His initiative highlights both authority and order in God&#8217;s community. Just as God had earlier called Moses from the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and had summoned the people to Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>), now Moses reflects that same divine pattern by gathering the craftsmen. We see the principle that spiritual leadership involves recognizing and mobilizing God-given gifts; compare Paul&#8217;s charge to Timothy to &#8220;fan into flame the gift of God&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bezalel, Oholiab</b><p>These two men are mentioned by name, underscoring how personally God knows and appoints His servants. Back in <a href="/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a> the LORD said, &#8220;See, I have called by name Bezalel&#8230; and I have appointed with him Oholiab.&#8221; Their inclusion reminds us that individual believers matter in God&#8217;s plan, much like how the Lord called Zacchaeus by name (<a href="/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5</a>). God&#8217;s work is never faceless; He delights to equip specific people for specific tasks.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and every skilled person</b><p>Beyond the named leaders, God welcomes &#8220;every skilled person&#8221;&#8212;an open invitation to all with ability. This echoes Paul&#8217;s teaching that the body has &#8220;many parts&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-14.htm">1 Corinthians 12:14-21</a>). No talent is insignificant; whether crafting gold clasps or weaving curtains, each skill contributes to the tabernacle&#8217;s beauty. In <a href="/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13-14</a> Huram, &#8220;filled with wisdom and understanding,&#8221; fashions temple bronze work, illustrating God&#8217;s ongoing use of artisans in redemptive history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whom the LORD had gifted&#8212;</b><p>Skill is explicitly attributed to the LORD. <a href="/exodus/35-31.htm">Exodus 35:31</a> says God &#8220;filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, understanding, and ability in all kinds of craftsmanship.&#8221; All abilities originate from the Creator (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). This prevents pride and fosters gratitude. It also assures us that God still equips believers today, distributing gifts &#8220;as He determines&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-11.htm">1 Corinthians 12:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>everyone whose heart stirred him</b><p>Ability alone is not enough; willingness matters. <a href="/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21</a> notes, &#8220;Everyone whose heart stirred him and whose spirit prompted him came.&#8221; The Spirit-stirred heart produces joyful service, much like the Macedonian believers who gave &#8220;of their own accord&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-3.htm">2 Corinthians 8:3-4</a>). God values voluntary devotion over compulsory labor. <a href="/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a> captures it: &#8220;Your people will volunteer freely in the day of Your power.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to come and do the work</b><p>The verse ends with action&#8212;&#8220;to come and do.&#8221; Faith expresses itself in tangible obedience (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). God provided detailed blueprints (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8-9</a>); now the people must execute them. Their craftsmanship would create a dwelling where God&#8217;s glory would reside. Similarly, believers are &#8220;created in Christ Jesus for good works&#8230; that we should walk in them&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>). Whatever we do, we are to work &#8220;with all your heart, as working for the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/36-2.htm">Exodus 36:2</a> portrays a beautiful synergy: God calls (through Moses), equips (through gifts), and motivates (through stirred hearts) so that His people willingly step forward to accomplish His work.
