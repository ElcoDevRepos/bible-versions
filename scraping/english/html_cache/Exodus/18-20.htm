In the context of Exodus, Moses is advised by his father-in-law Jethro to delegate responsibilities and educate the Israelites in God's decrees. The statutes and laws refer to the divine instructions given to Moses, which include moral, civil, and ceremonial laws. This teaching is foundational for the covenant community, establishing a framework for righteous living. The emphasis on teaching aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>, where parents are instructed to diligently teach God's commandments to their children, highlighting the generational transmission of faith.<p><b>and show them the way to live</b><br>This phrase underscores the practical application of God's laws in daily life. It is not enough to know the statutes; the Israelites must also understand how to live them out. This guidance is akin to the wisdom literature found in Proverbs, which offers practical advice for living a life pleasing to God. The "way to live" can be seen as a precursor to the concept of "walking in the Spirit" found in <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>, where believers are called to live according to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This phrase also foreshadows Jesus Christ, who declared Himself to be "the way" in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, embodying the perfect example of living according to God's will.<p><b>and the work they must do</b><br>This final phrase highlights the importance of action and responsibility within the community. The work refers to the duties and tasks necessary for maintaining order and justice among the people. In the historical context, this would include the administration of justice, community service, and religious observance. The concept of work is integral to the biblical narrative, beginning with God's command to Adam to tend the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>). In the New Testament, believers are encouraged to do good works as a reflection of their faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>). This phrase also points to the active role of believers in God's redemptive plan, as they are called to be co-laborers with Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egyptian bondage and guide them through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jethro.htm">Jethro</a></b><br>Moses' father-in-law, a Midianite priest, who visits Moses and offers wise counsel on leadership and governance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, recently freed from slavery in Egypt, who are learning to live as a covenant community under God's laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The location where Moses receives the Law from God, a significant place of divine revelation and instruction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting for the Israelites' journey, representing both physical and spiritual challenges as they learn to trust and obey God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership_in_teaching.htm">The Role of Leadership in Teaching</a></b><br>Moses is instructed to teach the people, highlighting the responsibility of leaders to impart God's truth and guide others in righteous living.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_god's_law.htm">The Importance of God's Law</a></b><br>The statutes and laws are not merely rules but a way of life that reflects God's character and purposes for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_out_god's_commands.htm">Living Out God's Commands</a></b><br>The phrase "the way to live" implies that God's laws are practical and applicable to daily life, not just theoretical knowledge.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/work_as_worship.htm">Work as Worship</a></b><br>The "work they must do" suggests that all aspects of life, including work, are opportunities to serve and honor God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_accountability.htm">Community and Accountability</a></b><br>Teaching and living out God's laws are communal activities, requiring mutual support and accountability among believers.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_18_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 18:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_teach_statutes_daily.htm">How can we "teach them the statutes" in our daily lives today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_18_20_on_godly_leadership.htm">What does Exodus 18:20 reveal about the importance of godly leadership?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_18_20_Jesus_on_discipleship.htm">How does Exodus 18:20 connect to Jesus' teachings on discipleship?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_guide_them_to_God_s_commands.htm">In what ways can we "show them the way" to follow God's commands?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_18_20_s_role_in_faith_mentoring.htm">How can Exodus 18:20 guide us in mentoring others in our faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_18_20_Guide_leaders_in_teaching.htm">How does Exodus 18:20 guide leaders in teaching God's laws and decrees effectively?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_supports_Exodus_18_20.htm">What historical context supports the instructions given in Exodus 18:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_18_20_s_role_in_moral_teaching.htm">How does Exodus 18:20 reflect the importance of moral and ethical teaching in society?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_18.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_role_does_satan_play_in_the_bible.htm">What constitutes the works of the law?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_god_hear_us_if_we_ask_by_his_will.htm">Why is the law insufficient for our salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_lev._18_5_vs._rom._3_20_a_contradiction.htm">Leviticus 18:5 promises life through obedience, yet Romans 3:20 says the Law can't grant righteousness.
