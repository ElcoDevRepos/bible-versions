The "cry" refers to the collective prayers and pleas of the Israelites, who have been suffering under harsh slavery. This echoes earlier biblical themes where God hears the cries of His people, such as in <a href="/genesis/21-17.htm">Genesis 21:17</a> with Hagar and Ishmael. Theologically, it underscores God's attentiveness and compassion towards human suffering. The phrase also highlights the covenant relationship between God and the Israelites, as He responds to their distress in fulfillment of His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>and I have seen how severely the Egyptians are oppressing them</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes God's awareness and concern for the plight of the Israelites. The word "seen" suggests not just observation but an intimate understanding of their suffering. The oppression by the Egyptians is historically rooted in the fear of the Israelites' growing numbers, as described in <a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8-14</a>. This oppression included forced labor and harsh treatment, which is corroborated by historical records of similar practices in ancient Egypt. Theologically, this sets the stage for God's deliverance, a recurring theme in Scripture where God acts to liberate His people from bondage, prefiguring the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ. The oppression also serves as a backdrop for the display of God's power and justice, as He will soon act decisively to free the Israelites, demonstrating His sovereignty over nations and rulers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the children of Israel, who are living in Egypt under severe oppression and slavery.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt, led by Pharaoh, who are oppressing the Israelites, forcing them into hard labor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who hears the cries of His people and is preparing to deliver them from bondage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Moses is the central figure in this chapter, being called by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_horeb.htm">Mount Horeb (Sinai)</a></b><br>The location where God appears to Moses in the burning bush, initiating the call to deliver the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_hears_the_oppressed.htm">God Hears the Oppressed</a></b><br>God is attentive to the cries of those who are suffering.
