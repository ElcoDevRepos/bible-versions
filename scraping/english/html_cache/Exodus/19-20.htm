Mount Sinai, also known as Horeb, is a significant location in the biblical narrative, traditionally identified with Jebel Musa in the Sinai Peninsula. The descent of the LORD signifies His willingness to engage directly with His people, a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as in the incarnation of Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The mountain itself becomes a sacred space, a common motif where divine encounters occur, as seen with Elijah on the same mountain (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8-18</a>).<p><b>and called Moses to the summit.</b><br>Moses is summoned to the summit, indicating his role as mediator between God and Israel. This calling is reminiscent of Moses' earlier encounter with God at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3:1-4</a>), emphasizing his unique position as a prophet and leader. The summit represents a place of revelation and covenant, where Moses receives the Law, which is foundational for Israel's identity and relationship with God. This mediatory role foreshadows Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>So Moses went up</b><br>Moses' ascent is an act of obedience and faith, demonstrating his willingness to approach God despite the fearsome manifestations of divine presence (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>). This ascent can be seen as a type of Christ's ascension, where He goes to the Father on behalf of humanity (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>). Moses' journey up the mountain is also symbolic of spiritual ascent, a theme in Christian spirituality where believers seek closeness with God through prayer and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who reveals Himself to His people and establishes His law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader and prophet of Israel, who acts as a mediator between God and the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>A significant location where God reveals Himself and gives the Ten Commandments to Moses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_descent_of_the_lord.htm">The Descent of the LORD</a></b><br>A theophany where God manifests His presence on Mount Sinai, signifying His holiness and authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ascent_of_moses.htm">The Ascent of Moses</a></b><br>Moses' response to God's call, demonstrating obedience and willingness to serve as an intermediary.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god.htm">The Holiness of God</a></b><br>God's descent to Mount Sinai underscores His holiness and the reverence due to Him.

As <a href="/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a> pictures, He &#8220;parted the heavens and came down,&#8221; reminding us that His presence is tangible, not symbolic.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the top of Mount Sinai</b><p>&#8226; God chooses a specific, elevated place, separating holiness from the ordinary (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>). The mountain trembles, smoke rises, and the people are kept at a safe distance.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18&#8211;20</a> recalls this scene to contrast the fear at Sinai with the grace now offered in Christ, yet both settings affirm that God&#8217;s holiness remains unchanged.<p>&#8226; The summit declares: approaching God requires His terms, not ours.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and called Moses to the summit</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s voice summons a mediator. Moses alone is invited higher while the nation waits below (<a href="/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; This call reinforces Moses&#8217; role as intercessor, foreshadowing the greater Mediator, &#8220;For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The invitation shows grace: the holy God provides a way for sinful people to hear His law through a chosen representative (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So Moses went up</b><p>&#8226; Moses responds immediately. Obedience is the fitting answer to divine summons (<a href="/exodus/24-15.htm">Exodus 24:15&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; His ascent models faithful leadership: trusting God amid thunder and fire. <a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a> commends him as &#8220;faithful in all God&#8217;s house.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The pattern carries forward: Jesus tells His disciples, &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). True faith acts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a> reveals a real moment in history when the holy God descended, marked out a sacred meeting place, summoned His chosen mediator, and received an obedient response. The verse answers the human need for access to God: He comes down, sets boundaries for our good, calls a representative, and invites obedient faith. The scene prepares us for the ultimate descent in Christ, who fulfills and surpasses Moses&#8217; mediating role, granting all who believe bold access to the living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">On the top of the mount.</span>--On the summit of the Ras Sufsafeh, not on the Jebel Musa, which is out of sight from the plain of Er Rahah.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the top of the mount</span>.
