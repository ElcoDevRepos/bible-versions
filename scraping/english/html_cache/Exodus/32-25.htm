His observation of the people's behavior indicates a breakdown in order and discipline. This chaos occurred while Moses was on Mount Sinai receiving the Law, highlighting the people's quick departure from God's commandments. The phrase "out of control" suggests a lack of restraint and moral decay, reminiscent of the period of the Judges when "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>for Aaron had let them run wild</b><br>Aaron, Moses' brother and the high priest, was left in charge during Moses' absence. His failure to maintain order and uphold God's standards led to the people's idolatry with the golden calf. This reflects a leadership failure, as Aaron succumbed to the people's demands rather than standing firm in his faith. It serves as a warning about the consequences of weak spiritual leadership and the importance of adhering to God's commands, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/29-18.htm">Proverbs 29:18</a>, "Where there is no vision, the people perish."<p><b>and become a laughingstock to their enemies</b><br>The Israelites' behavior not only dishonored God but also damaged their reputation among surrounding nations. This phrase underscores the importance of God's people maintaining a distinct and holy identity, as their actions reflect on God's character. The term "laughingstock" implies ridicule and scorn, which can be seen as a fulfillment of the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, where disobedience would lead to becoming "an object of horror, scorn, and ridicule." This situation foreshadows the need for a perfect mediator, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who would restore the relationship between God and His people and uphold God's honor among the nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

The presence of Moses in the camp - his impressive act in breaking the tables - even his seizure of the idol and consignment of it to destruction - did not arrest the licentious orgy in which the people had engaged before his coming. The "play" that had followed on the feasting still continued; though we may suppose that many had been impressed and had desisted. Moses felt that an example must be made, and a stop put to conduct which was more and more provoking the Almighty, and might at any moment bring down the judgment of complete destruction upon the whole people. He therefore took his station at the main gate of the camp (ver. 26), and shouted the words "Who is on Jehovah's side? Here, to me!" The sound of the words could not, of course, have reached very far - but they rallied to him those of his own tribe who stood near, and thus placed a strong force at his disposal. Moses bade them get their swords, and proceed through the camp from end to end, slaying the idolaters - not, we may be sure, indiscriminately, but executing God's judgment on those who were most conspicuous and persistent. They were especially bidden not to spare their own nearest and dearest, which implies that many Levites were among the ringleaders. The result was the destruction by the sword of three thousand men - and the suppression of the festival. It is not to be doubted that Moses had Divine sanction for what he did in this matter (ver. 27). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people were naked</span>. It has been suggested that "licentious" or "unruly" would be a better rendering (Gesenius, Dathe, Rosenmuller, Kalisch, Cook), but the primary sense of <span class="accented">pharua</span> is "naked," "stript;" and of the licentious orgies of the East, stripping or uncovering the person was a feature (Herod. 2:60), so that there is no reason for changing the expression used in the Authorised Version. Moses saw that most of the people were still without the garments that they had laid aside when they began to dance, and were probably still engaged in dancing and shouting. <span class="cmt_word">Aaron had made them naked</span>. Aaron is said to have done that to which his actions had led. He had made the calf and proclaimed a festival. The "nakedness" had naturally followed. <span class="cmt_word">Unto their shame among their enemies</span>. Amalekites were no doubt still hovering about the camp; indeed, the tribe probably still held most of the surrounding mountains. They would witness the orgy, and see the indecent and shameful exposure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/32-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
