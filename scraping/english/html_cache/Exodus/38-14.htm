Fifteen cubits, approximately 22.5 feet, indicates a specific and intentional design, reflecting God's precise instructions for the tabernacle. This measurement ensures symmetry and balance, which are important in biblical architecture, symbolizing order and divine perfection. The curtains' length also parallels the concept of covering and protection, akin to God's covering over His people.<p><b>with three posts and three bases</b><br>The number three often symbolizes completeness and divine perfection in biblical numerology, seen in the Trinity and other scriptural instances. The posts and bases provide structural support, ensuring stability and durability, which are essential for the tabernacle's function as a mobile sanctuary. The materials used, likely acacia wood overlaid with bronze, reflect the tabernacle's blend of earthly and heavenly elements, pointing to the intersection of the divine and human realms.
