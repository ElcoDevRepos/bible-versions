The act of borrowing implies a trust relationship between neighbors, reflecting the communal lifestyle of the Israelites. This phrase sets the stage for understanding the responsibilities and ethical considerations in such transactions. The principle of borrowing and lending is also seen in other parts of the Bible, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-6.htm">Deuteronomy 15:6</a>, which discusses lending to nations.<p><b>and it is injured or dies</b><br>This phrase addresses the potential risks involved in borrowing. The law anticipates accidents or unforeseen events that could harm the borrowed property. The inclusion of both injury and death covers a range of possible outcomes, emphasizing the need for accountability. This reflects the broader biblical principle of stewardship, where individuals are responsible for the care of what is entrusted to them, as seen in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<p><b>while its owner is not present</b><br>The absence of the owner implies that the borrower has full responsibility for the animal's care. This detail highlights the importance of presence and oversight in the protection of property. It also suggests that if the owner were present, they might share in the responsibility or decision-making, potentially altering the outcome. This concept of responsibility in the absence of the owner can be paralleled with the idea of God entrusting humans with the earth, expecting them to care for it in His absence (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>).<p><b>he must make full restitution</b><br>Restitution is a key theme in biblical law, emphasizing justice and restoration. The requirement for full restitution underscores the principle that one must make amends for losses incurred under their care. This reflects the broader biblical theme of justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/leviticus/6.htm">Leviticus 6:1-7</a>, where restitution is required for wrongs committed. The concept of restitution also points to the redemptive work of Christ, who made full restitution for humanity's sins, restoring the broken relationship between God and man (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_borrower.htm">The Borrower</a></b><br>The individual who borrows an animal from his neighbor.

Scripture teaches, &#8220;The wicked borrow and do not repay&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-21.htm">Psalm 37:21</a>), underscoring the moral duty to honor any loan.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/21-33.htm">Exodus 21:33-34</a> shows that responsibility accompanies possession: if someone&#8217;s ox falls into a pit he dug, he must compensate the owner. The principle remains the same&#8212;use of another&#8217;s property obligates care.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and it is injured or dies</b><p>&#8226; The verse assumes no malicious intent, only mishap. Yet mishap does not erase accountability (see <a href="/deuteronomy/22-1.htm">Deuteronomy 22:1-3</a>, which commands returning lost livestock even when loss was accidental).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a> reminds, &#8220;A righteous man regards the life of his animal,&#8221; implying diligence in protection.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law safeguards both property and creatures; the borrower&#8217;s duty includes reasonable care (compare <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>, where stewards are judged by how they handle what is entrusted to them).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>while its owner is not present</b><p>&#8226; Absence of the owner removes any possibility that the owner contributed to the damage; the borrower alone controlled circumstances.<p>&#8226; When the owner is on-site, verse 15 (next in context) shifts liability: shared supervision lessens blame. This distinction is echoed in <a href="/ezekiel/33-6.htm">Ezekiel 33:6</a>&#8212;if the watchman is absent, guilt falls on him; presence spreads responsibility.<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/6-5.htm">Galatians 6:5</a> calls each believer to &#8220;carry his own load,&#8221; a New-Testament echo of personal responsibility emphasized here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he must make full restitution</b><p>&#8226; Full repayment restores what was lost, mirroring earlier restitution laws (<a href="/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-1.htm">Leviticus 6:1-5</a>). God requires not partial, but complete restoration.<p>&#8226; Zacchaeus modeled this heart in <a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>, pledging fourfold repayment; Christ affirmed such repentance.<p>&#8226; Restitution protects community trust. It also foreshadows the atonement where Christ &#8220;paid in full&#8221; (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>) for sin we could never repay&#8212;God&#8217;s own pattern of justice and mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The verse teaches that permission to use another&#8217;s property never cancels responsibility. If the borrower alone is in charge and loss occurs, he must replace the full value. Scripture consistently links stewardship with accountability, calling believers to honor trust, protect what belongs to others, and willingly restore any damage they cause.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14, 15) Lending is a species of deposit; but for the benefit, not of the depositor, but of the man with whom the deposit is made. The obligation of the latter to keep intact and to return is therefore even more stringent than in the preceding case. Consequently, if the thing lent were lost or injured, however the loss was brought about, the borrower was justly called upon to make it good. The only exception was, when the lender was still in charge of what he lent, present with it, and able to keep guard over it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15</span> LAW OF BORROWING. - The act of borrowing is connected with that of depositing, since in both cases, the property of one man is committed to the hands of another; only, in the one case, it is at the instance and for the benefit of the man into whose hands the property passes; in the other case, it is at the instance and for the benefit of the other party. This difference causes a difference of obligation. The borrower, having borrowed solely for his own advantage, must take all the risks, and in any case return the thing borrowed, or its value, unless the owner was still, in some sort, in charge of his own property. Things hired are not, however, to be regarded as borrowed. If harm come to them, the owner must suffer the loss. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And it be hurt or die</span>. - The thing borrowed might be animate or inanimate; either might be "hurt;" the former might not only be hurt, but "die." Whatever the damage, and whatever the cause, unless in the single rare case of the owner being in charge, the law required the borrower to make good the loss to the owner. This law must have acted as a considerable check upon borrowing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/22-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
