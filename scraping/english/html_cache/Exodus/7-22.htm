This reflects the spiritual battle between the God of Israel and the gods of Egypt. The magicians' ability to mimic the miracle suggests the presence of real spiritual power, though inferior to God's. This event highlights the theme of counterfeit miracles, which is echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>) where false signs and wonders are mentioned. The magicians' actions also demonstrate the hardness of Pharaoh's heart, as he relied on them to validate his resistance to God's command.<p><b>So Pharaoh&#8217;s heart was hardened,</b><br>The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a central theme in the Exodus narrative. It illustrates the tension between divine sovereignty and human free will. While God predicted and allowed Pharaoh's heart to harden, Pharaoh himself chose to resist God's command. This hardening serves as a warning against persistent unbelief and rebellion against God. Theologically, it underscores the idea that God can use even the obstinacy of individuals to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17-18</a>.<p><b>and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron,</b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to listen to Moses and Aaron is indicative of his pride and stubbornness. Despite witnessing a miraculous sign, Pharaoh's heart remained closed to the message of God. This refusal is a pattern seen throughout the plagues, where Pharaoh's resistance grows stronger. It serves as a reminder of the importance of humility and openness to God's word. The role of Moses and Aaron as God's messengers parallels the prophetic tradition, where prophets often faced rejection despite delivering God's truth.<p><b>just as the LORD had said.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the fulfillment of God's word and His foreknowledge. God had already informed Moses that Pharaoh would not easily let the Israelites go (<a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>). This assurance to Moses highlights God's control over the situation and His ultimate plan for deliverance. It reassures believers of God's faithfulness and the certainty of His promises, as seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>). The phrase also underscores the reliability of God's word, a theme that resonates throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart was hardened against the Israelites and God&#8217;s commands.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>God&#8217;s chosen leaders to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptian_magicians.htm">Egyptian Magicians</a></b><br>Practitioners of secret arts who replicated the miracles performed by Moses and Aaron.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nile_river.htm">The Nile River</a></b><br>The site of the first plague where water was turned into blood, demonstrating God&#8217;s power over Egyptian deities.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who demonstrates His sovereignty and power through the plagues.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_human_power_against_god.htm">The Futility of Human Power Against God</a></b><br>The magicians&#8217; ability to replicate the miracles only served to harden Pharaoh&#8217;s heart further, illustrating that human power and deception cannot stand against God&#8217;s ultimate authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_hardening_of_the_heart.htm">The Hardening of the Heart</a></b><br>Pharaoh&#8217;s refusal to listen, despite witnessing God&#8217;s power, serves as a warning about the dangers of a hardened heart.

The verse highlights the danger of valuing deceptive signs over revealed truth and showcases the unerring certainty of God&#8217;s prior word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">The magicians . . . did so with their enchantments.</span>--The act of the magicians must have been a very poor imitation of the action of Moses and Aaron. The two brothers had turned into blood all the waters of the river, the canals, the pools or lakes, and the reservoirs. The magicians could not act on this large scale. They could only operate, or seem to operate, on some small quantity of water, obtained probably in the way noticed in <a href="/exodus/7-24.htm" title="And all the Egyptians dig round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.">Exodus 7:24</a>. On this they succeeded, so far as to satisfy Pharaoh, who was probably easy to satisfy, and perhaps so far as to satisfy the courtiers. They turned the liquid of a red colour, or by sleight-of-hand substituted blood for it. The result was subjected to no test, and was perhaps not even done in the presence of any hostile witness. But it enabled the king to harden himself, and refuse the request of the brothers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - On the occurrence of the second sign and first plague, the magicians were again consulted; and, by means which it is impossible to do more the. conjecture, they produced a seeming transformation into blood of a certain quantity of water. The inquiry, whence they procured the water, is answered by ver. 24. That they actually turned water into blood is scarcely asserted in the vague "did so" of ver. 22. Perhaps they had recourse to sleight of hand, and made a substitution, like modern conjurors; perhaps they merely turned the water of a red colour. All that was necessary was to convince Pharaoh that they were able to do what Moses and Aaron had done - there was no one to watch, and test, and examine their pretended miracle, which consequently passed muster, though it may have been no more than a trick. Pharaoh, however, suffered himself to be convinced, and "turned and went into his house" without paying any attention to the marvel wrought (ver. 23). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The magicians of Egypt did so</span>. They could not do what Moses and Aaron had done - stretch out, that is, a rod over the Nile, and turn it and all its branches, and ponds, and pools, into blood, for <span class="accented">this was already</span> done. They could only show their skill upon some small quantity of water in a cup or other vessel. No doubt they produced some apparent change, which was accepted by Pharaoh as an equivalent to what had been effected by the Israelite chiefs, but which must have fallen far short of it. Pharaoh would not be a severe critic. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/7-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the magicians</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1496;&#1467;&#1502;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;ar&#183;&#7789;um&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2748.htm">Strong's 2748: </a> </span><span class="str2">An engraver, writer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Egypt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1430;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4714.htm">Strong's 4714: </a> </span><span class="str2">Egypt -- a son of Ham, also his descendants and their country in Northwest Africa</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
