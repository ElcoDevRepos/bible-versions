This reflects the Israelites' initial reaction to the mysterious substance provided by God. Manna is a miraculous provision from God, emphasizing His care and sustenance for His people during their wilderness journey. This event occurs after the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, highlighting their dependence on God for daily sustenance. Manna is also a type of Christ, as Jesus refers to Himself as the "bread of life" in <a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>, drawing a parallel between the physical sustenance provided by manna and the spiritual sustenance He offers.<p><b>It was white like coriander seed</b><br>The description of manna as "white like coriander seed" provides a visual image of its appearance. Coriander seeds are small, round, and pale, suggesting the purity and divine origin of manna. The whiteness can symbolize purity and holiness, attributes often associated with God and His provisions. This detail also serves to distinguish manna from other natural substances, reinforcing its miraculous nature.<p><b>and tasted like wafers made with honey.</b><br>The taste of manna is described as being like "wafers made with honey," indicating its pleasant and sweet flavor. Honey is often associated with abundance and blessing in the Bible, as seen in the description of the Promised Land as "a land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). This sweetness can symbolize the goodness and generosity of God's provision. Additionally, the reference to honey connects manna to the future promise of the land of Canaan, serving as a foretaste of the blessings to come. The sweetness of manna can also be seen as a type of the sweetness of Christ's teachings and the satisfaction found in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_israel.htm">House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the collective descendants of Jacob, also known as the Israelites, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/manna.htm">Manna</a></b><br>The miraculous food provided by God to the Israelites during their 40-year journey in the wilderness.
