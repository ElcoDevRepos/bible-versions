Historically, Pharaohs were considered divine figures, and their commands were seen as law. This decree reflects the growing fear of the Israelites' increasing population and potential threat to Egyptian power. The command to all his people suggests a nationwide policy, emphasizing the severity and widespread nature of the oppression.<p><b>Every son born to the Hebrews you must throw into the Nile:</b><br>The Nile River was central to Egyptian life, symbolizing both sustenance and death. This command to throw Hebrew male infants into the Nile was a form of population control and an attempt to weaken the Israelites by eliminating future male leaders and warriors. This act of infanticide is reminiscent of later biblical events, such as Herod's massacre of the innocents in <a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>, drawing a parallel between Moses and Jesus as deliverers of their people. The Nile, a source of life, becomes a place of death, highlighting the perversion of Pharaoh's order.<p><b>But every daughter you may allow to live:</b><br>Allowing the daughters to live suggests a strategic decision by Pharaoh. Females were not seen as a military threat, and their survival could lead to assimilation into Egyptian culture, potentially diluting Hebrew identity. This reflects a common ancient practice of subjugating a people by absorbing them into the dominant culture. The survival of the daughters also sets the stage for the role of women in the deliverance narrative, such as Moses' mother, Jochebed, and sister, Miriam, who play crucial roles in his survival and eventual leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The king of Egypt who issued the decree to kill Hebrew male infants.

In Sparta, the State decided which children should live and which should die. At Athens a law of Solon left the decision to the parent. At Rome, the rule was that infants were made away with, unless the father interposed, and declared it to be his wish that a particular child should be brought up. The Syrians offered unwelcome children in sacrifice to Moloch; the Carthaginians to Melkarth. In China infanticide is said to be a common practice at the present day. Heathen nations do not generally regard human life as sacred. On the contrary, they hold that considerations of expediency justify the sweeping away of any life that inconveniences the State. Hence infanticide is introduced by Plato into his model republic (<span class= "ital">Rep. </span>v. 9). Almost all ancient nations viewed the massacre of prisoners taken in war as allowable. The Spartan <span class= "ital">crypteia </span>was a system of licensed murder. The condemnation to death of all male Hebrew children by Pharaoh is thus in no respect improbable. On the other hand, the mode of the death presents difficulties. For, first, the Nile was viewed as a god; and to fill it with corpses would, one might have supposed, have been regarded as a pollution. Secondly, the Nile water was the only water drunk; and sanitary considerations might thus have been expected to have prevented the edict. Perhaps, however, the children were viewed as offerings to the Nile, or to Savak, the crocodile headed god, of whom each crocodile was an emblem. At any rate, as the Nile swarmed with crocodiles throughout its whole course, the bodies were tolerably sure to be devoured before they became putrescent.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every son that is born</span>. The words are universal, and might seem to apply to the Egyptian, no less than the Hebrew, male children. But they are really limited by the context, which shows that there had never been any question as to taking the life of any Egyptian. With respect to the objection sometimes raised, that no Egyptian monarch would possibly have commanded such wholesale cold-blooded destruction of poor innocent harmless children, it is to be observed, first, that Egyptian monarchs had very little regard indeed for the lives of any persons who were not of their own nation. They constantly massacred prisoners taken in war - they put to death or enslaved persons cast upon their coasts (Diod. Sic. 1:67) - they cemented with the blood of their captives, as Lenormant says ('Manuel d'Hist. Anc.,' vol. 1. p. 423), each stone of their edifices. The sacredness of human life was not a principle with them. Secondly, that tender and compassionate regard for children which seems to us Englishmen of the present day a universal instinct is in truth the fruit of Christianity, and was almost unknown in the ancient world. Children who were "not wanted" were constantly exposed to be devoured by wild beasts, or otherwise made away with (Dollinger, ' Jew and Gentile,' vol. it. p. 246); and such exposition was defended by philosophers (Plat. 'Pep.' 5. p. 460 c). In Syria and Carthage they were constantly offered to idols. At Rome, unless the father interposed to save it, every child was killed. It would probably not have cost an Egyptian Pharaoh a single pang to condemn to death a number of children, any more than a number of puppies. And the rule "Salus publica suprema lex," which, if not formulated, still practically prevailed, would have been held to justify anything. <span class="cmt_word">The river</span>. Though, in the Delta, where the scene is laid throughout the early part of Exodus, there were many branches of the Nile, yet we hear constantly of "the river" (<a href="/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3, 5</a>; <a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20, 21</a>; <a href="/exodus/8-3.htm">Exodus 8:3</a>, etc.), because one branch only, the Tanitic, was readily accessible.
