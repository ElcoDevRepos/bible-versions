In the ancient Near East, it was common for foreigners to reside in different lands due to trade, war, or other circumstances. The inclusion of foreigners in religious practices highlights the openness of the Israelite community to those outside their ethnic group, provided they adhere to certain covenantal requirements.<p><b>and wants to celebrate the LORD&#8217;s Passover</b><br>The Passover was a pivotal event commemorating Israel's deliverance from Egyptian bondage. It was not only a historical remembrance but also a spiritual observance. The desire of a foreigner to participate indicates a recognition of the LORD's sovereignty and a willingness to align with His people. This foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in the New Covenant, as seen in the New Testament.<p><b>all the males in the household must be circumcised</b><br>Circumcision was the sign of the Abrahamic Covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). It was a physical mark of belonging to God's chosen people. For a foreigner to partake in the Passover, circumcision was necessary, symbolizing a full commitment to the covenant community. This requirement underscores the seriousness of entering into a relationship with God and His people.<p><b>then he may come near to celebrate it</b><br>The phrase "come near" suggests a movement towards holiness and participation in the sacred. It implies that once the covenantal sign is observed, the foreigner is granted full access to the religious life of Israel. This mirrors the New Testament teaching that through Christ, believers are brought near to God (<a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>).<p><b>and he shall be like a native of the land</b><br>This indicates full inclusion and equality within the community of Israel. The foreigner, once circumcised, is no longer seen as an outsider but as one who fully belongs. This prefigures the New Testament concept of the church as one body, where there is neither Jew nor Gentile (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>But no uncircumcised man may eat of it</b><br>This restriction emphasizes the sanctity and exclusivity of the Passover meal. It serves as a boundary marker for the community, ensuring that only those who have committed to the covenant can participate. This principle of separation for holiness is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live distinct lives (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigner.htm">Foreigner (Ger)</a></b><br>A non-Israelite residing among the Israelites who desires to participate in the Passover.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover (Pesach)</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/circumcision.htm">Circumcision (Brit Milah)</a></b><br>A physical sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants, required for participation in the Passover.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, chosen by God as His people, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (YHWH)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, who instituted the Passover as a perpetual ordinance for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_in_worship.htm">Inclusivity in Worship</a></b><br>The passage highlights God's provision for foreigners to join in worship, emphasizing that faith and obedience to God's commands open the door to full participation in the community of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_commitment.htm">Covenant Commitment</a></b><br>Circumcision as a requirement for Passover participation underscores the importance of covenant commitment.

Thus, anyone&#8212;whether native or foreigner&#8212;who embraces the Lord&#8217;s covenant provision finds full inclusion in His redeemed family, while those who remain outside the covenant remain excluded from its blessings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 48, 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when a stranger</span>, etc. Here we have the positive ordinance corresponding to the implied permission in ver. 19, and modifying in the most important and striking way the prohibitive enactment of ver. 43.
