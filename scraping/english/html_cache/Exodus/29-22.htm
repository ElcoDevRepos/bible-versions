The fat symbolized richness and abundance, and its offering was a sign of giving the best to God. This practice is consistent with other ancient Near Eastern cultures where fat was a valuable commodity.<p><b>the fat tail</b><br>The fat tail refers to the fatty tissue found in the tail of certain breeds of sheep, particularly those in the Middle East. This part of the animal was highly prized and considered a delicacy. Its inclusion in the sacrifice underscores the importance of offering valuable portions to God.<p><b>the fat covering the entrails</b><br>The fat covering the entrails, or the suet, was considered a choice part of the animal. In the sacrificial system, the entrails and their fat were often burned on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord, symbolizing the inner purity and dedication required of the priests.<p><b>the lobe of the liver</b><br>The liver was associated with life and vitality in ancient cultures. Offering the lobe of the liver in the ordination sacrifice may symbolize the dedication of the priest's life and service to God. The liver's role in purification and detoxification can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual cleansing.<p><b>both kidneys with the fat on them</b><br>The kidneys were considered the seat of emotion and thought in ancient Hebrew culture. Offering the kidneys, along with their fat, signifies the dedication of one's innermost thoughts and emotions to God. This act of sacrifice represents a total commitment to God's service.<p><b>and the right thigh</b><br>The right thigh was traditionally given to the priest as a portion of the peace offering. In the context of ordination, it signifies the priest's right to partake in the offerings and his role in mediating between God and the people. The right side often symbolizes strength and favor in biblical texts.<p><b>(since this is a ram for ordination)</b><br>The ordination of priests was a significant event in Israel's religious life, marking the consecration of individuals to serve in the tabernacle. The use of a ram, a valuable and strong animal, underscores the importance of the priestly role. This ordination process foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who would offer Himself as the perfect sacrifice for humanity's sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to mediate the covenant at Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>The first priests of Israel, set apart for service to God.
