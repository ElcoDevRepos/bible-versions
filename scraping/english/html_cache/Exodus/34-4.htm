The original tablets were inscribed by God Himself (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>), symbolizing divine authority and the permanence of God's law. The act of Moses preparing the tablets this time indicates human responsibility in maintaining the covenant. This mirrors the need for repentance and restoration after sin. The tablets being "like the originals" emphasizes the continuity and unchanging nature of God's commandments.<p><b>He rose early in the morning,</b><br>Rising early signifies Moses' eagerness and obedience to God's command. In biblical times, early morning was often a time for significant spiritual encounters (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>). This phrase highlights the importance of prioritizing God's instructions and the readiness to meet with Him. It also reflects the discipline and dedication required in spiritual leadership.<p><b>and taking the two stone tablets in his hands,</b><br>The physical act of carrying the tablets underscores the weight and responsibility of God's law. It symbolizes the role of Moses as a mediator between God and the people of Israel. The tablets, representing God's covenant, were to be handled with care and reverence. This act prefigures Christ, who bears the new covenant through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<p><b>he went up Mount Sinai</b><br>Mount Sinai is a significant location in biblical history, known as the mountain of God (<a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>). It is where Moses first encountered God in the burning bush and where the Ten Commandments were originally given. The ascent of Mount Sinai represents a journey towards divine presence and revelation. It is a place of covenant renewal and divine instruction, paralleling the transfiguration of Jesus on a mountain (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>).<p><b>as the LORD had commanded him.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Moses' obedience to God's specific instructions. It reflects the biblical principle that true worship and service to God must be according to His commands, not human invention (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). Moses' compliance is a model of faithfulness and submission to divine authority, pointing to Christ's perfect obedience to the Father (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central human figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the mediator between God and His people.

Moses&#8217; careful obedience shows how seriously he takes the covenant&#8212;even after Israel&#8217;s sin with the golden calf (<a href="/bsb/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>).<p>&#8226; The work is tangible and physical; grace does not erase responsibility. Compare <a href="/deuteronomy/10-1.htm">Deuteronomy 10:1&#8211;2</a>, where God again directs Moses to prepare tablets for His words.<p>&#8226; These tablets mirror the originals written &#8220; with the finger of God &#8221; (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>).

Morning devotion frames the entire day&#8212;see <a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>, &#8220; In the morning, LORD, You hear my voice. &#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Taking the two stone tablets in his hands</b><p>&#8220; And taking the two stone tablets in his hands &#8221;<p>&#8226; Moses personally carries what will house God&#8217;s own words (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-15.htm">Deuteronomy 9:15</a>). The leader bears the weight&#8212;literally&#8212;of the covenant on behalf of the people.<p>&#8226; Hands-on faith: Moses doesn&#8217;t delegate the task. Compare Joshua later bearing the ark across the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The image points forward to Christ, who bears the law&#8217;s demands and fulfills them perfectly (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He went up Mount Sinai</b><p>&#8220; He went up Mount Sinai &#8221;<p>&#8226; Sinai is where heaven touches earth (<a href="/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a>).

Moses readies new tablets, rises early, carries them himself, climbs Sinai, and does it all exactly as God says.

It has been questioned whether God did actually write the words upon the second tables; but Kurtz's arguments upon the point are unanswerable.
