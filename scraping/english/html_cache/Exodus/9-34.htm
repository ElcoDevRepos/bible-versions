The cessation of the storm signifies a temporary reprieve from God's judgment. In the ancient Near East, weather phenomena were often seen as manifestations of divine power. The Egyptians worshiped gods like Seth, who was associated with storms, but the plagues demonstrated the LORD's supremacy over these deities. The cessation of the storm might have led Pharaoh to believe that the threat was over, revealing a common human tendency to forget divine intervention once immediate danger passes.<p><b>he sinned again</b><br>Pharaoh's sin here is his refusal to let the Israelites go, despite his previous promises. This reflects a pattern of disobedience and rebellion against God's commands. In biblical terms, sin is often described as missing the mark or failing to live up to God's standards. Pharaoh's repeated sinning highlights the hardness of his heart and his resistance to God's will. This pattern is reminiscent of the cycle of sin and repentance seen throughout the Old Testament, particularly in the book of Judges.<p><b>and hardened his heart&#8212;he and his officials</b><br>The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a central theme in the Exodus narrative. It illustrates the tension between divine sovereignty and human responsibility. While God is said to harden Pharaoh's heart in some passages, here it is Pharaoh himself who hardens his heart, showing his culpability. This hardening is a deliberate choice to resist God's command, reflecting a spiritual blindness and stubbornness. The mention of his officials indicates that this was not just a personal decision but one that involved the leadership of Egypt, suggesting a collective resistance to God's will. This hardening can be seen as a type of the ultimate rejection of God, which is fulfilled in the New Testament by those who reject Christ, the true deliverer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who repeatedly hardened his heart against God's commands delivered through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and where God demonstrated His power through the plagues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plagues.htm">The Plagues</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments sent by God to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites, with the hail being the seventh plague.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/officials_of_pharaoh.htm">Officials of Pharaoh</a></b><br>The advisors and leaders in Pharaoh's court who also participated in the hardening of their hearts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_a_hardened_heart.htm">The Danger of a Hardened Heart</a></b><br>Pharaoh's repeated hardening of his heart serves as a warning against resisting God's will and the consequences of persistent sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_patience.htm">God's Sovereignty and Patience</a></b><br>Despite Pharaoh's obstinance, God patiently demonstrated His power and gave multiple opportunities for repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceitfulness_of_sin.htm">The Deceitfulness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin can deceive and harden our hearts, leading us away from God's truth and grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leaders.htm">The Role of Leaders</a></b><br>Pharaoh's officials also hardened their hearts, showing how leadership can influence others for good or ill.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_god's_warnings.htm">Responding to God's Warnings</a></b><br>We must be attentive and responsive to God's warnings in our lives, unlike Pharaoh who ignored them.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_9_34_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 9:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Pharaoh_s_resistance_to_God_in_Exodus.htm">How does Pharaoh's heart hardening in Exodus 9:34 reflect human resistance to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_God_s_patience_from_Pharaoh.htm">What can we learn about God's patience from Pharaoh's actions in Exodus 9:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_34_Romans_9_17-18_link.htm">How does Exodus 9:34 connect to Romans 9:17-18 about God's sovereignty?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_hardening_our_hearts_2.htm">How can we guard against hardening our hearts like Pharaoh in Exodus 9:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Exodus_9_34_inspire_repentance.htm">In what ways can Exodus 9:34 inspire us to seek genuine repentance today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Pharaoh_resist_after_Exodus_9_34.htm">Why did Pharaoh harden his heart again in Exodus 9:34 despite witnessing God's power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_34_Human_defiance_vs_divine.htm">How does Exodus 9:34 reflect human resistance to divine intervention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_34_Free_will_vs_divine_control.htm">What does Exodus 9:34 reveal about free will versus divine sovereignty?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_harden_hearts_yet_judge.htm">Exodus 7:3&#8211;4: How can a loving God harden a person&#8217;s heart and still hold them accountable?

The second, which appears in <a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>, and Exodus 13:15, is a stronger term, and means "to be hard," or, in the Hiphil, "to make hard."
