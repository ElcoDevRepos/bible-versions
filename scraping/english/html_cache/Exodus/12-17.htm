It commemorates the haste with which the Israelites left Egypt, not having time to let their bread rise. Leaven, or yeast, is often symbolic of sin in the Bible (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>), and the removal of leaven from homes during this feast represents purification and holiness. This feast is a call to remember God's deliverance and to live a life set apart from sin.<p><b>for on this very day I brought your divisions out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase highlights the historical event of the Exodus, where God delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. The term "divisions" suggests an organized departure, emphasizing God's sovereignty and order in the liberation process. The Exodus is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing God's power and faithfulness. It is also a type of Christ's redemptive work, as Jesus delivers believers from the bondage of sin (<a href="/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31</a>, which uses the term "exodus" to describe Jesus' departure).<p><b>You must keep this day as a permanent statute</b><br>The command to observe this day as a "permanent statute" underscores its enduring significance. It is not merely a historical remembrance but a perpetual ordinance, reflecting the unchanging nature of God's covenant with His people. This observance is a reminder of God's eternal promises and His call for His people to remember His acts of salvation throughout generations.<p><b>for the generations to come</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of passing down the story of God's deliverance to future generations. It is a call to teach children about God's mighty works and faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>). The continuity of this observance ensures that each generation understands their identity as God's people and their responsibility to live in obedience to Him. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, whose sacrifice is remembered and proclaimed until He returns (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-26.htm">1 Corinthians 11:26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

Israel was to treat this feast as non-negotiable, just as they would later guard the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a>). By removing every trace of leaven (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>) they acted out separation from sin&#8212;Paul applies the same truth to believers, urging us to &#8220;cleanse out the old leaven&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7-8</a>). The feast also began immediately after Passover (<a href="/leviticus/23-5.htm">Leviticus 23:5-6</a>), linking salvation and sanctification so tightly that one naturally follows the other.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For on this very day I brought your divisions out of the land of Egypt</b><p>God ties the command to a historic act: the literal, miraculous exodus (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). &#8220;Divisions&#8221; underscores that every family and tribe left in ordered ranks, fulfilling God&#8217;s promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>). Remembering the date anchors faith in fact, much like the Lord&#8217;s Supper anchors us to the historical cross (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>). The feast is therefore a living memorial: tasting unleavened bread triggers gratitude for real deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You must keep this day as a permanent statute</b><p>&#8220;Permanent&#8221; means lasting, not temporary or adaptable. Other laws may be fulfilled differently under the New Covenant, but memorial ordinances stand until God Himself says otherwise (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>). For Israel, the annual observance in Jerusalem (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-5.htm">Deuteronomy 16:5-6</a>) kept national identity centered on redemption rather than geography or politics. The continuity of Passover into the millennial kingdom (<a href="/ezekiel/45-21.htm">Ezekiel 45:21</a>) shows God&#8217;s unbroken storyline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the generations to come</b><p>God looks beyond the original audience, commanding transmission of truth to children (<a href="/exodus/12-26.htm">Exodus 12:26-27</a>). Each generation hears first-hand testimony: &#8220;what the LORD did for me&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/13-8.htm">Exodus 13:8</a>). This shapes a culture of faith that resists assimilation, just as the perpetual rainbow reminds all peoples of God&#8217;s covenant with Noah (<a href="/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12-13</a>). In the church age, teaching doctrine to the next generation remains a core mandate (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/12-17.htm">Exodus 12:17</a> calls every believer to treasure God&#8217;s deliverance, dramatize holiness, and relay the story without dilution.
