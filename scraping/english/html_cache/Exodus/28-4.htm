The most conspicuous was the breastplate, described in <a href="/context/exodus/28-13.htm" title="And you shall make ouches of gold;">Exodus 28:13-30</a>, and here mentioned first of all. Next to this came the peculiar vestment called the "ephod," a sort of jerkin or waistcoat, upon which the breastplate was worn (described in <a href="/context/exodus/28-6.htm" title="And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.">Exodus 28:6-12</a>). Under the ephod was the long robe of blue, called "the robe of the ephod," which may be considered as the main garment, and which is described in <a href="/context/exodus/28-31.htm" title="And you shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.">Exodus 28:31-35</a>. Upon his head the high priest wore a "mitre" or turban (described in <a href="/context/exodus/28-36.htm" title="And you shall make a plate of pure gold, and grave on it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.">Exodus 28:36-38</a>); and inside his "robe" he wore a linen shirt or tunic, secured by a girdle (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm" title="And you shall embroider the coat of fine linen, and you shall make the turban of fine linen, and you shall make the girdle of needlework.">Exodus 28:39</a>).
