This commandment was given to the Israelites as a sign of the covenant between them and God, reflecting the rest God took after creation (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). The Sabbath was a day set apart for worship and rest, emphasizing trust in God's provision.<p><b>some of the people went out to gather</b><br>Despite clear instructions to rest on the Sabbath, some Israelites disobeyed, revealing a lack of faith and understanding of God's commands. This action highlights human nature's tendency to rely on self-effort rather than trust in divine provision. It serves as a reminder of the importance of obedience and faith in God's word.<p><b>but they did not find anything</b><br>This outcome underscores the futility of disobedience and the reliability of God's instructions. God had provided double the manna on the sixth day to ensure the people had enough for the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/16-5.htm">Exodus 16:5, 22</a>-26). The absence of manna on the seventh day was a tangible lesson in trusting God's provision and timing.
