The rhetorical question emphasizes the uniqueness and supremacy of Yahweh. In the context of the Exodus, this is a declaration of God's victory over the Egyptian deities, as each plague demonstrated His power over specific aspects of Egyptian religion. This theme is echoed in passages like <a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5</a>, where God declares there is no other god besides Him.<p><b>Who is like You&#8212;majestic in holiness,</b><br>The term "majestic in holiness" underscores God's absolute purity and separateness from creation. Holiness is a defining attribute of God, setting Him apart from all other beings. This concept is foundational in the Levitical laws, where holiness is a requirement for the people of Israel (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). The majesty of God's holiness is also reflected in the vision of <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, where the seraphim proclaim, "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty."<p><b>revered with praises,</b><br>God's actions and character naturally elicit worship and reverence. The deliverance of Israel from Egypt is a cause for praise, as seen in the Song of Moses, which this verse is part of. The reverence due to God is a recurring theme in the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a>, which states that God is enthroned on the praises of Israel. This reverence is not only for His mighty acts but also for His enduring faithfulness and covenant love.<p><b>performing wonders?</b><br>The wonders refer to the miraculous acts God performed during the Exodus, such as the parting of the Red Sea and the plagues upon Egypt. These acts are signs of God's power and His intervention in human history. The term "wonders" is often associated with God's redemptive acts, as seen in <a href="/psalms/77-14.htm">Psalm 77:14</a>, which speaks of God displaying His power among the peoples. These wonders foreshadow the ultimate act of redemption through Jesus Christ, whose miracles and resurrection are the greatest wonders of the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_the_israelites.htm">Moses and the Israelites</a></b><br>Moses leads the Israelites in a song of praise after their deliverance from Egypt and the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure of worship in this verse, recognized for His unparalleled holiness and power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The site of the miraculous event where God parted the waters, allowing the Israelites to escape from the pursuing Egyptian army.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The oppressors of the Israelites, whose defeat at the Red Sea is celebrated in this song.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_song_of_moses.htm">The Song of Moses</a></b><br>A song of victory and praise, traditionally attributed to Moses, celebrating God's deliverance and power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/majestic_holiness.htm">Majestic Holiness</a></b><br>Recognize and revere God's holiness in your daily life.

Standing on the shore, he asks a rhetorical question that highlights the utter emptiness of every rival deity.<p>- Scripture insists on the LORD&#8217;s unrivaled supremacy: &#8220;To you it was shown, so that you would know that the LORD is God; there is no other besides Him&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-35.htm">Deuteronomy 4:35</a>).<p>- David sings the same truth generations later: &#8220;Among the gods there is none like You, O Lord&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/86-8.htm">Psalm 86:8</a>). Isaiah echoes it: &#8220;I am the LORD, and there is no other&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5</a>).<p>- The question silences idolatry and calls believers to exclusive allegiance&#8212;no syncretism, no divided heart (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who is like You&#8212;majestic in holiness</b><p>- Holiness describes God&#8217;s absolute moral purity and His complete &#8220;otherness.&#8221; Hannah prays, &#8220;There is no one holy like the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-2.htm">1 Samuel 2:2</a>).<p>- Isaiah&#8217;s vision of the seraphim crying &#8220;Holy, holy, holy&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>) and John&#8217;s similar scene in <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a> underline that holiness is not a trait God possesses but the essence of who He is.<p>- Because He is &#8220;majestic in holiness,&#8221; His people must pursue holiness: &#8220;Be holy, because I am holy&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Revered with praises</b><p>- The LORD is &#8220;enthroned on the praises of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a>).

Earthly worship previews that eternal chorus.<p>- Practical take-away: cultivate a lifestyle of praise&#8212;alone, in families, and gathered with the church (<a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Performing wonders</b><p>- The song recalls the Red Sea miracle (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). &#8220;You are the God who works wonders; You display Your strength among the peoples&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/77-14.htm">Psalm 77:14</a>).<p>- Wonders punctuate Israel&#8217;s history: manna (<a href="/bsb/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>), Jordan&#8217;s parting (<a href="/bsb/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3</a>), fire on Carmel (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>).<p>- Jesus&#8217; ministry continues the pattern: &#8220;Jesus the Nazarene was a Man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s wonders are never mere spectacle; they reveal His character and advance His saving purposes (<a href="/psalms/136-4.htm">Psalm 136:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> piles question upon question to drive home one truth: the LORD stands alone.

Our calling is to recognize that uniqueness, worship Him wholeheartedly, and live in confident obedience to the One &#8220;who was, and is, and is to come&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11, 12) Stanza 3 is a short one, entering into no details--simply summing up the entire result in two sentences: one, parallel to <a href="/context/exodus/15-2.htm" title="The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.">Exodus 15:2-3</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/15-6.htm" title="Your right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: your right hand, O LORD, has dashed in pieces the enemy.">Exodus 15:6-7</a>, setting forth the glory of God, as shown in the occurrences; the other emphasising the great fact of the occasion, and stating it in the briefest possible terms: "Thou stretchedst out thy right hand; the earth swallowed them." This second clause is parallel to <a href="/context/exodus/15-4.htm" title="Pharaoh's chariots and his host has he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.">Exodus 15:4-5</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/15-8.htm" title="And with the blast of your nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.">Exodus 15:8-10</a>. It concentrates into four words the gist of those two passages.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">Who is like unto thee . . . Among the gods </span>?--This is undoubtedly the true meaning. It had been a main object of the entire series of miraculous visitations to show that Jehovah was "exalted far above all other gods." (See <a href="/exodus/7-5.htm" title="And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth my hand on Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.">Exodus 7:5</a>; <a href="/exodus/14-4.htm" title="And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honored on Pharaoh, and on all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.">Exodus 14:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/14-18.htm" title="And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honor on Pharaoh, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.">Exodus 14:18</a>.) Moses now emphasises the contrast by adducing three points on which Jehovah is unapproachable--holiness, awefulness, and miraculous power. God is (1) "glorious in holiness," exalted in this respect far, far above all other beings; (2) "fearful in praises"--the proper object of the profoundest awe, even to those who approach Him with praise and thanksgiving; and (3) one who "doeth wonders," who both through nature, and on occasions overruling nature, accomplishes the most astonishing results, causing all men to marvel at His Almighty power. The gods of the heathen were, in fact, either nonentities or evil spirits. So far as they were the former, they could come into no comparison at all with Jehovah; so far as they were the latter, they fell infinitely short of Him in every respect. Of holiness they possessed no remnant; in awfulness they were immeasurably inferior; in the ability to work wonders they did not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. "Among the gods," as the Psalmist says, "there is none like unto thee, O Lord; there is none that can do as thou doest" (<a href="/psalms/86-8.htm" title="Among the gods there is none like to you, O Lord; neither are there any works like to your works.">Psalm 86:8</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12</span> contain the third stanza of the first division of the ode. It is short compared to the other two, containing merely a fresh ascription of praise to God, cast in anew form; and a repetition of the great fact which the poem commemorates - the Egyptian overthrow. We conceive that Miriam's chorus (ver. 21) was again interposed between verses 10 and 11. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods?</span> It was one great object of the whole series of miraculous visitations whereof Egypt had been the scene, that the true God, Jehovah, should be exalted far above all the gods of the heathen. (See <a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>; <a href="/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4, 18</a>.)
