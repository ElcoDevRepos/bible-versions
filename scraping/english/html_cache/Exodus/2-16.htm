Midian was a region located in the northwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula. The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through his wife Keturah (<a href="/genesis/25.htm">Genesis 25:1-2</a>), indicating a shared ancestry with the Israelites. This connection may have influenced Moses' later acceptance in Midian. The priest's role could imply a position of respect and authority within the community.<p><b>had seven daughters</b><br>The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible. The mention of seven daughters highlights the priest's family structure and may suggest a sense of divine providence or blessing. In a patriarchal society, daughters were often involved in domestic and agricultural duties, as seen here.<p><b>and they came to draw water</b><br>Drawing water was a common task for women in ancient times, reflecting the daily life and responsibilities of women in pastoral societies. Wells were central to community life, serving as places of social interaction and essential resources for survival. This scene sets the stage for Moses' encounter with the daughters, which leads to his integration into Midianite society.<p><b>and fill the troughs to water their father&#8217;s flock</b><br>This phrase indicates the daughters' role in tending to the family's livestock, a vital economic activity. The act of watering the flock demonstrates their industriousness and responsibility. It also foreshadows Moses' future role as a shepherd, both literally in Midian and metaphorically as the leader of Israel. The imagery of shepherding is a recurring biblical theme, often associated with leadership and care, and is later used to describe Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest_of_midian.htm">Priest of Midian</a></b><br>This refers to Jethro (also known as Reuel), who is a significant figure in Moses' life.

Fugitives from Egypt generally took the northern route from Pelusium or Migdol to Gaza, and so to Syria, or the regions beyond. But in this quarter they were liable to be arrested and sent back to the Egyptian monarch. Rameses II: put a special clause to this effect into his treaty with the contemporary Hittite king (Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. 2 p. 73). It was, perhaps, the fear of extradition which made Moses turn his steps southeastward, and proceed along the route, or at any rate in the direction, which he afterwards took with his nation. Though Egypt had possessions in the Sinaitic peninsula, it was not difficult to avoid them; and before Sinai was reached the fugitive would be in complete safety, for the Egyptians seem never to have penetrated to the southern or eastern parts of the great triangle. "The well," by which Moses took up his abode, is placed with some probability in the neighbourhood of Sherm, about ten miles north-east of Ras Mahommed, the southern cape of the peninsula <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The priest of Midian</span>. <span class="accented">Cohen</span> is certainly "priest" here, and not "prince," since the father-in-law of Moses exercises priestly functions in <a href="/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>.
