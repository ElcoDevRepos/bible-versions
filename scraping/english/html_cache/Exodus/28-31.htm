The ephod itself was a sacred vestment, and the robe was an essential part of the high priest's attire. This robe was worn underneath the ephod and was integral to the priestly garments described in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>. The high priest's garments symbolized holiness and the unique role of the priest as a mediator between God and the people. The robe's design and function highlight the importance of the priesthood in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>entirely of blue cloth</b><br>The use of blue cloth is significant in the biblical context. Blue was a color associated with the heavens and divinity, often symbolizing the presence of God. In the tabernacle, blue was used extensively, including in the curtains and the veil, indicating its sacred nature. The color blue in the high priest's robe would remind the Israelites of the heavenly origin of their laws and the divine authority of the priesthood. This connection to the divine is further emphasized in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-39</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to wear tassels with a blue cord to remember God's commandments. The robe's blue color also foreshadows the heavenly ministry of Jesus Christ, our High Priest, who mediates a new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the priestly garments from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, who was appointed as the first high priest of Israel.

Like Noah building the ark (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>) and Moses erecting the tabernacle &#8220;just as the LORD had commanded&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>), obedience brings the blessing of God&#8217;s presence.<p>- This clear instruction also underlines that holiness is not self-defined. <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a> reminds us that the earthly sanctuary is &#8220;a copy and shadow of what is in heaven,&#8221; so precise obedience matters.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the robe of the ephod</b><p>- The robe (sometimes called the &#8220;robe of the ephod&#8221;) was worn under the ephod yet over the linen tunic (<a href="/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-7.htm">Leviticus 8:7</a>). It set the high priest apart from all other priests.<p>- Purpose and symbolism:<p>&#8226; It distinguished the mediator of the covenant (compare <a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>).<p>&#8226; It testified to the beauty and glory of God (<a href="/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Its tassels of pomegranates and bells (v. 33&#8211;35) announced the priest&#8217;s movement, ensuring that &#8220;he will not die.&#8221; The garment literally guarded life, pointing to Christ, our High Priest, whose perfect righteousness keeps us alive before God (<a href="/hebrews/7-23.htm">Hebrews 7:23&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>entirely of blue cloth</b><p>- &#8220;Entirely&#8221; shows completeness&#8212;no mixture, no compromise. Holiness demands wholeness (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>- Blue in Scripture often draws the eye upward to heaven. The sky itself preaches the color&#8217;s message. God told all Israel to add a blue cord to their tassels &#8220;so that you may remember and do all My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38&#8211;40</a>).<p>- On the tabernacle curtains and veil, blue thread likewise pictured the heavenly throne (<a href="/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1, 31</a>). <a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a> and <a href="/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a> both link sapphire or deep blue tones to God&#8217;s dwelling.

The high priest&#8217;s blue robe declared that only complete, uncompromised holiness can dwell in God&#8217;s presence&#8212;a truth ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, our flawless High Priest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>3. THE ROBE OF THE EPHOD.</span><p>(31-35) The "robe of the ephod" was a frock or tunic, reaching from the neck to below the knees. It was put on over the head, for which a hole was left (<a href="/exodus/28-32.htm" title="And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the middle thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.">Exodus 28:32</a>). Josephus says that it had no sleeves; and it would seem that the upper portion, above the waist, was wholly, or almost wholly, concealed by the ephod and breastplate; but the lower portion, from the waist downwards, formed the outer dress of the high priest, and was conspicuous. The plain blue contrasted well with the variegated ephod and the sparkling breastplate. The robe had no ornament excepting round the bottom, where it was fringed with alternate bells and pomegranates. The pomegranates were a decoration, and nothing more; but the bells served a purpose, which is explained in <a href="/exodus/28-35.htm" title="And it shall be on Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard when he goes in to the holy place before the LORD, and when he comes out, that he die not.">Exodus 28:35</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-35.</span> - THE ROBE OF THE EPHOD. Underneath the ephod and breast-plate the high priest was to wear a robe, or frock, wholly of blue. This robe was to have a hole for the head at the top, and was to be woven without seam (<a href="/exodus/39-22.htm">Exodus 39:22</a>). It was put on over the head, like a habergeon or coat of mail, and probably reached below the knee. Josephus says that it had no sleeves. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All of blue</span>. This plainness and uniformity offered a strong contrast to the variegated hues of the breast-plate and ephod, and threw those portions of the attire into greater prominence.
