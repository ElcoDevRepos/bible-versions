It highlights the lack of recognition of Moses' authority at this point in his life. The question echoes the broader theme of divine appointment and authority seen throughout the Bible, where God often chooses unlikely leaders. This phrase also foreshadows Moses' future role as a divinely appointed leader and judge over Israel, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a> when God calls Moses from the burning bush. The question also parallels the rejection of Jesus by His own people, as seen in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>, where He came to His own, but they did not receive Him.<p><b>Are you planning to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?&#8221;</b><br>This accusation reveals that Moses' act of killing the Egyptian was not as secret as he had hoped. It underscores the theme of hidden sins being brought to light, a concept echoed in <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>, "be sure your sin will find you out." The mention of the Egyptian connects to the broader narrative of Israel's oppression in Egypt and Moses' initial attempt to deliver his people through his own strength. This foreshadows the need for divine intervention and guidance, which becomes a central theme in Moses' life and mission. The reference to killing also prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who conquers sin and death not by taking life, but by giving His own.<p><b>Then Moses was afraid and thought, &#8220;This thing I have done has surely become known.&#8221;</b><br>Moses' fear indicates his awareness of the consequences of his actions and the potential threat to his life from Pharaoh. This moment marks a turning point, leading to Moses' flight to Midian, where he spends 40 years in preparation for his future role. The phrase "this thing I have done" reflects personal accountability and the realization of the gravity of his actions. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of God's timing and methods, contrasting Moses' initial reliance on his own strength with his later dependence on God's power. This theme of fear and revelation is mirrored in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to bring their deeds into the light (<a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20-21</a>) and trust in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew by birth, raised in Pharaoh's palace, who later becomes the leader of the Israelites.

The verse warns against resisting God&#8217;s chosen servants, exposes the reach of sin&#8217;s consequences, and highlights how the Lord sovereignly shapes His instruments in ways that surpass human expectation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?</span>--As the reputed son of a princess, Moses would be in some sort a "prince."

He had not really interfered as one who claimed authority, but as any man of position and education naturally interferes to stop a quarrel.<p><span class= "bld">Intendest thou to kill me?</span>--Here is the sting of the rejoinder; here was the assumption of authority--not in the interposition of to-day, but in the blow of yesterday.

"Murder will out," says the English proverb. Perhaps, though Moses thought himself unnoticed, some Egyptian had seen the deed.

There was no assumption of lordship or of judicial authority in the bare inquiry, "Why smitest thou thy neighhour?" nor in the fuller phrase reported by St. Stephen, "Sirs, ye are brethren. Why do ye wrong one to another?" (<a href="/acts/7-26.htm">Acts 7:26</a>), unless as coupled with the deed of the preceding day. Thus the violence of today renders of no avail the loving persuasion of to-morrow; the influence for good which the education and position of Moses might have enabled him to exercise upon his nation was lost by the very act to which he had been urged by his sympathy with them; it was an act which could be thrown in his teeth, an act which he could not justify, which he trembled to find was known. The retort of the aggressor stopped his mouth at once, and made his interposition valueless. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the man replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1440;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
