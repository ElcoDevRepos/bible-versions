It underscores the divine authority behind the plagues, showing that they are not random natural disasters but acts of judgment from God. This communication is consistent with the pattern seen throughout the Exodus narrative, where God instructs Moses on how to lead the Israelites and confront Pharaoh.<p><b>Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt</b><br>The act of stretching out the hand is symbolic of divine power and authority being exercised through Moses. This gesture is a recurring motif in the plagues, signifying God's control over nature and His ability to use it as an instrument of judgment. It also prefigures the miracles of Jesus, who often used physical gestures to perform healings and other miraculous acts.<p><b>so that the locusts may swarm over it</b><br>Locusts are a well-documented natural phenomenon in the region, known for their destructive power. In the biblical context, they are often associated with divine judgment and are mentioned in other scriptures, such as <a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>, as a symbol of devastation. The swarming of locusts represents a complete and overwhelming judgment, leaving no part of the land untouched.<p><b>and devour every plant in the land</b><br>This phrase highlights the totality of the destruction intended by the plague. The locusts' consumption of every plant signifies the stripping away of Egypt's agricultural resources, which were vital for survival. This devastation would have had severe economic and social implications, further pressuring Pharaoh to release the Israelites.<p><b>everything that the hail has left behind</b><br>The reference to the hail connects this plague to the previous one, showing a progression in the severity of God's judgments. The hail had already damaged the land, and the locusts would complete the destruction. This cumulative effect demonstrates the relentless nature of God's judgment against Egypt's stubbornness and refusal to acknowledge His sovereignty. It also serves as a warning of the consequences of hardening one's heart against God, a theme echoed throughout scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who demonstrates His power and sovereignty over creation and the gods of Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved, representing a place of oppression and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/locusts.htm">Locusts</a></b><br>A plague sent by God as a judgment against Egypt, symbolizing destruction and divine retribution.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose hardened heart leads to the suffering of his people and the eventual liberation of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nature.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nature</a></b><br>The plague of locusts demonstrates God's control over creation.
