This is the ninth plague, the plague of darkness, which has left Egypt in a state of chaos and fear. Pharaoh's authority is challenged by the persistent demands of Moses and the power of God. This summoning reflects the ongoing struggle between Pharaoh's hardened heart and God's will, as seen throughout the narrative of the plagues.<p><b>&#8220;Go, worship the LORD.</b><br>Pharaoh's concession to allow the Israelites to worship signifies a partial acknowledgment of the LORD's power. The term "worship" here is central to the Israelites' identity and purpose, as their journey is not just a physical exodus but a spiritual pilgrimage to serve and honor God. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of worship as a response to divine deliverance, seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a> and <a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>.<p><b>Even your little ones may go with you;</b><br>Allowing the children to go highlights the importance of family in worship and covenant community. In the cultural context, children were integral to the community's future and spiritual heritage. This concession by Pharaoh is significant because it acknowledges the communal aspect of Israelite worship, which includes all generations, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a> and <a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4-7</a>.<p><b>only your flocks and herds must stay behind.&#8221;</b><br>Pharaoh's insistence on keeping the livestock reveals his attempt to maintain control and leverage over the Israelites. Livestock were essential for sacrifices, sustenance, and economic stability, making them a critical component of Israel's worship and survival. This demand reflects Pharaoh's continued resistance to fully submitting to God's command. The importance of sacrifices is underscored in <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1-7</a>, and the concept of complete devotion to God is echoed in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who is resistant to God's command to let the Israelites go.
