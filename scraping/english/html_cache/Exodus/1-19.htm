This interaction highlights the courage and faith of these women who feared God more than the king. Their response is a form of civil disobedience, prioritizing divine law over human law. This moment is significant as it sets the stage for God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt, showing that God often uses unexpected people to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>&#8220;The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women</b><br>This statement draws a distinction between the Hebrew and Egyptian women, possibly reflecting cultural or perceived physical differences. The Hebrews, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were living in Egypt as foreigners. The Egyptians, on the other hand, were the native people of the land. This distinction may also imply a divine favor or blessing upon the Hebrew women, aligning with God's promise to multiply the descendants of Abraham.<p><b>for they are vigorous</b><br>The term "vigorous" suggests strength and vitality, possibly indicating that the Hebrew women were robust and healthy, able to give birth quickly. This vigor could be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to make the Israelites fruitful and multiply them exceedingly (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). It also underscores the idea that God was preserving His people even under oppression.<p><b>and give birth before a midwife arrives.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase implies that the Hebrew women were delivering their babies so quickly that the midwives could not intervene, thus thwarting Pharaoh's plan to kill the male infants. This rapid childbirth could be seen as a miraculous intervention by God to protect the future generations of Israel. It also highlights the theme of God's sovereignty and protection over His people, as seen throughout the Exodus narrative. This act of divine preservation foreshadows the ultimate deliverance of Israel from Egypt, pointing to God's faithfulness in fulfilling His covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrew_midwives.htm">Hebrew Midwives</a></b><br>Shiphrah and Puah, the midwives mentioned earlier in <a href="/bsb/exodus/1.htm">Exodus 1</a>, who feared God and defied Pharaoh's orders to kill Hebrew male infants.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The king of Egypt who ordered the killing of Hebrew male infants to suppress the growing population of the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrew_women.htm">Hebrew Women</a></b><br>The Israelite women described as vigorous, giving birth before the midwives could arrive.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and where these events took place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_providence.htm">God's Providence</a></b><br>The underlying theme of God's protection and providence for His people, even in dire circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_god_over_fear_of_man.htm">Fear of God Over Fear of Man</a></b><br>The midwives' actions demonstrate the importance of fearing God above all earthly authorities.

So they took refuge in a half truth, and pretended that what really occurred in some cases only was a general occurrence.
