The family unit was central to societal stability, and respect for parents was seen as foundational to maintaining order. This commandment is an extension of the fifth commandment found in <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>, which calls for honoring one's father and mother. In the ancient Near Eastern context, cursing one's parents was considered a severe violation of social norms and divine law, reflecting a rebellious heart against God's established order.<p><b>must surely be put to death</b><br>The prescribed punishment underscores the gravity of the offense. In the theocratic society of ancient Israel, certain sins were considered capital offenses because they threatened the covenant community's holiness and integrity. This severe penalty served as a deterrent against actions that could undermine family and societal structures. The death penalty for cursing parents is also mentioned in <a href="/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>, reinforcing its seriousness. While the New Testament does not prescribe such penalties, it upholds the principle of honoring parents (<a href="/ephesians/6.htm">Ephesians 6:1-3</a>).
