In ancient Near Eastern cultures, shoulders often represented strength and responsibility. The high priest bore the names of the tribes of Israel on these shoulder pieces, signifying his role as a mediator between God and the people.<p><b>attached at two of its corners</b><br>The attachment at the corners indicates a precise and intentional design, ensuring stability and functionality. This detail reflects the meticulous nature of God's instructions for the tabernacle and priestly garments, emphasizing the importance of obedience and order in worship. The corners may also symbolize the encompassing nature of God's covenant with Israel, as the high priest represents all the tribes.<p><b>so it can be fastened</b><br>The fastening of the shoulder pieces ensured that the ephod remained secure during the high priest's duties. This stability is crucial, as it reflects the unchanging and steadfast nature of God's covenant. The fastening mechanism may also point to the binding nature of the priestly role, as the high priest is bound to his duties and responsibilities.
