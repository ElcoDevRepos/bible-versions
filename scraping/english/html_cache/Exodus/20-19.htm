The people are overwhelmed by the divine presence, which included thunder, lightning, and the sound of a trumpet. This request for Moses to mediate reflects the Israelites' fear and reverence for God, acknowledging Moses as their leader and prophet. This moment underscores the role of Moses as an intermediary between God and His people, a role that prefigures the mediatory work of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>"But do not let God speak to us, or we will die."</b><br>The Israelites' fear of dying if God speaks directly to them highlights the holiness and power of God, which sinful humans cannot withstand. This fear is rooted in the understanding that no one can see God and live (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). The people's reaction is consistent with other biblical accounts where individuals express fear in the presence of God or His angels (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>, <a href="/luke/1-12.htm">Luke 1:12</a>). This request for a mediator foreshadows the need for a savior who can bridge the gap between a holy God and sinful humanity. Jesus Christ fulfills this role, providing a way for believers to approach God with confidence (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>). The Israelites' plea also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's transcendence and the necessity of reverence in His presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to mediate between God and the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now at Mount Sinai receiving the Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses and where the Israelites experienced God's presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Almighty, who reveals Himself to the Israelites at Mount Sinai, demonstrating His holiness and power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_giving_of_the_law.htm">The Giving of the Law</a></b><br>The event where God delivers the Ten Commandments to the Israelites through Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fear_of_the_lord.htm">The Fear of the Lord</a></b><br>The Israelites' fear of God's voice underscores the holiness and majesty of God.
