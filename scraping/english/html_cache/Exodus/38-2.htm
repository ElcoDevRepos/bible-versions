In ancient Near Eastern culture, horns were associated with authority and might. The four corners suggest completeness and universality, indicating that the altar's influence and purpose extend in all directions. The horns were also used for ritual purposes, such as the application of blood during sacrifices, symbolizing atonement and purification (<a href="/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>).<p><b>so that the horns and altar were of one piece</b><br>The unity of the horns and the altar signifies the integral nature of the sacrificial system in Israelite worship. This construction method emphasizes the inseparability of the altar's function and its symbolic elements. The altar, being of one piece, reflects the wholeness and perfection required in offerings to God, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is both the altar and the sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>).<p><b>and he overlaid the altar with bronze</b><br>Bronze, a durable and resilient metal, was commonly used in the construction of the tabernacle's furnishings. Its use here indicates the altar's strength and ability to withstand the intense heat of the sacrifices. Bronze is also associated with judgment in the Bible, as seen in the bronze serpent (<a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>) and the bronze feet of Christ in <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>.
