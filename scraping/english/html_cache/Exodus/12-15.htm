This feast commemorates the Israelites' hasty departure from Egypt, where they did not have time to let their bread rise. Unleavened bread, or matzah, symbolizes purity and the absence of sin, as leaven often represents sin or corruption in biblical symbolism (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>). The seven-day period signifies completeness and perfection in biblical numerology, reflecting a complete cycle of purification and dedication to God.<p><b>On the first day you are to remove the leaven from your houses.</b><br>Removing leaven from the house is a physical act that symbolizes spiritual cleansing. In the context of the Exodus, it was a practical necessity due to the haste of departure, but it also serves as a metaphor for removing sin from one's life. This practice is still observed in Jewish households today during Passover, where a thorough cleaning is done to ensure no leaven is present. The act of removing leaven can be seen as a precursor to the Christian practice of self-examination and repentance.<p><b>Whoever eats anything leavened from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.</b><br>The severe consequence of being "cut off" underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands. In ancient Israel, being cut off could mean excommunication or even death, depending on the context. This phrase highlights the seriousness with which God views sin and disobedience. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching on church discipline and the need for purity within the community of believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-13</a>). The emphasis on community purity reflects the holiness required by God and the need for His people to be set apart from the surrounding nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being instructed on how to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread as part of their deliverance from Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which the Israelites are being delivered.

God underscores that deliverance and obedience belong together.<p>&#8211; &#8220;Cut off&#8221; signifies more than social shunning; it involves forfeiting covenant blessings (<a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>; <a href="/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a>).<p>&#8211; Mercy is always available through repentance (<a href="/leviticus/5-17.htm">Leviticus 5:17-19</a>), but willful defiance has consequences.<p>&#8211; The warning also protects the whole nation; unchecked sin spreads (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1-12</a>).<p>&#8211; For believers today, persistent unrepentant sin breaks fellowship and invites discipline (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-31.htm">1 Corinthians 11:31-32</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a> establishes a week-long memorial of unleavened bread that both remembers Israel&#8217;s swift deliverance and illustrates God&#8217;s call to purity. Day one begins with a thorough house-cleaning to remove leaven, symbolizing sin&#8217;s removal. Anyone who ignores the command faces covenant separation, proving holiness is not optional. The passage points forward to Christ, our sinless Passover Lamb, and calls every redeemed heart to celebrate freedom by living free from the leaven of sin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Seven days.</span>--The division of time into periods of seven days each was unknown to the more ancient Egyptians, but is thought to have existed in Babylonia as early as B.C. 2000. That it was recognised in the family of Abraham appears from <a href="/genesis/29-27.htm" title="Fulfill her week, and we will give you this also for the service which you shall serve with me yet seven other years.">Genesis 29:27</a>. According to some, God established the division by an express command to our first parents in Paradise that they should keep the seventh day holy (see <a href="/genesis/2-3.htm" title="And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.">Genesis 2:3</a>); but this is greatly questioned by others, who regard <a href="/genesis/2-3.htm" title="And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.">Genesis 2:3</a> as <span class= "ital">anticipatory,</span> and think the Sabbath was not instituted until the giving of the manna (<a href="/exodus/16-23.htm" title="And he said to them, This is that which the LORD has said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD: bake that which you will bake to day, and seethe that you will seethe; and that which remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.">Exodus 16:23</a>). However this may have been, it is generally allowed that the Israelites had not observed the seventh day in Egypt. where, indeed, they were held to labour continually. and that the Sabbath as an actual observance dates from the Exodus. The injunction here given, if it belongs to the time of the tenth plague, would be the first preliminary note of warning with respect to the Sabbath, raising an expectation of it, and preparing the way for it, leading up to the subsequent revelations in the wilderness of Sin and at Sinai.<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall put away leaven out of your houses.</span>--There was to be no compromise, nothing resembling half measures. Leaven, taken as typical of corruption, was to be wholly put away, not allowed by any householder to lurk anywhere within his house--a solemn warning that we are to make no compromise with sin.<p><span class= "bld">That soul shall be cut off from Israel.</span>--See the Note on <a href="/genesis/17-14.htm" title="And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.">Genesis 17:14</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seven days.</span> There is no indication that the week of seven days was admitted by the ancient Egyptians, or even known to them. Apparently, the nation which first adopted it was that of the Babylonians. Abraham may have brought it with him from "Ur of the Chaldees;" and from him it may have passed to Jacob, and so to Moses. That the week was known in the family of Abraham before the giving of the law, appears from <a href="/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27, 28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Unleavened bread</span> is typical of purity of heart, leaven being an emblem of corruption (<a href="/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6-12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). "Leaven," says Plutarch, "comes from corruption, and corrupts the dough with which it is mixed; and every fermentation seems to be a putrefaction." The primary command to celebrate the first passover with unleavened instead of leavened bread (ver. 8), must be attributed wholly to this symbolism. But the permanent institution of a "feast of unleavened bread," to last a week, had a double bearing. Partly, it was designed to deepen and intensify the conviction that corruption and impurity disqualify for religions service; but it was also partly intended as a commemoration of the fact, that in their hasty flight from Egypt the bread which they took with them was unleavened (ver. 340, and that they were forced to subsist on this for several days. (Compare the double meaning of the "bitter herbs, noticed in the comment on verse 8, <span class="accented">ad</span> <span class="accented">fin</span>.) The requirement to "put away leaven out of their houses" is probably intended to teach, that for family worship to he acceptable, the entire household must be pure, and that to effect this result the head of the household must, so far as he can, eject the leaven of sin from his establishment. <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever eateth... shall be out off from Israel</span>.

If a man wilfully transgresses any plain precept of God, even though it be a positive one, he should he severed from the Church, until he confess his fault, and repent, and do penance for it. Such was the ', godly discipline" of the primitive Church; and it were well if the Churches of these modern times had more of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/12-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For seven</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1444;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;i&#7687;&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7651.htm">Strong's 7651: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seven, seven times, a week, an indefinite number</span><br /><br /><span class="word">days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you must eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1499;&#1461;&#1428;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#234;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">unleavened bread.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4682.htm">Strong's 4682: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sweetness, sweet, an unfermented cake, loaf, the festival of Passover</span><br /><br /><span class="word">On the first</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;ri&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
