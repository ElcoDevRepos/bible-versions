The Tabernacle was a portable sanctuary used by the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The coupling from bottom to top signifies a comprehensive and secure assembly, ensuring that the structure was both stable and unified. This can be seen as a metaphor for the unity and completeness of God's covenant with Israel, as well as the unity of the body of Christ in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>).<p><b>and fitted into a single ring</b><br>The use of a single ring to fit the boards together highlights the precision and intentionality in the Tabernacle's design. This reflects the order and perfection of God's creation and His instructions. The ring can symbolize the eternal nature of God's covenant, as rings often represent eternity and unbroken promises. In a broader theological context, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the perfect and eternal mediator of the New Covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<p><b>He made both corners in this way</b><br>The mention of corners indicates the completion and integrity of the structure. Corners are often seen as points of strength and stability in construction. In biblical symbolism, corners can represent the foundation and strength of God's kingdom. This is echoed in the New Testament where Christ is referred to as the "chief cornerstone" (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>), signifying His foundational role in the Church. The careful construction of the Tabernacle's corners underscores the importance of following God's precise instructions, which is a recurring theme throughout the Exodus narrative.<div

together...&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/36-29.htm">Exodus 36:29</a>)<p>&#8226; Moses records that these two wooden frames were firmly joined, not merely placed side-by-side. Their connection made each frame stronger than it would have been alone, illustrating how God&#8217;s dwelling place depends on unified parts. <a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a> speaks of believers who &#8220;grow into a holy temple in the Lord,&#8221; showing that the Lord still uses individual lives, bound together, to form His house.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/exodus/26-6.htm">Exodus 26:6</a> the Lord had already ordered that the curtains be &#8220;joined together,&#8221; underscoring that every element of the tabernacle echoed the same theme of oneness (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Unity is never optional in the Lord&#8217;s plans; it is engineered into the very framework.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From bottom to top</b><p>&#8220;...from bottom to top...&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/36-29.htm">Exodus 36:29</a>)<p>&#8226; The coupling wasn&#8217;t partial; it ran the full height of the frames. That thorough connection ensured stability against shifting desert winds. Likewise, <a href="/psalms/125-1.htm">Psalm 125:1</a> reminds us that &#8220;those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people aren&#8217;t meant to be loosely associated at a single point; we are called to share life &#8220;from the least to the greatest&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>), bound together in every dimension.<p>&#8226; This top-to-bottom bond foreshadows the total covering Christ provides&#8212;He is &#8220;the author and finisher&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>), embracing the believer&#8217;s life from start to finish.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fitted into a single ring</b><p>&#8220;...and fitted into a single ring.&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/36-29.htm">Exodus 36:29</a>)<p>&#8226; The ring locked both frames in perfect alignment, preventing wobble. <a href="/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a> says the whole body is &#8220;held together&#8221; by what every joint supplies, a truth pictured here.<p>&#8226; Rings in the tabernacle often signified mobility&#8212;poles slid through them so the structure could move when God led (<a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14</a>). Even while anchored, these corner frames stayed ready for forward movement at God&#8217;s command, just as believers are rooted yet responsive (<a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226; A &#8220;single ring&#8221; also speaks to singular lordship; one point of authority governs all parts (<a href="/ephesians/4-5.htm">Ephesians 4:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He made both corners in this way</b><p>&#8220;He made both corners in this way.&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/36-29.htm">Exodus 36:29</a>)<p>&#8226; Consistency mattered. The north-west and south-west corners mirrored each other, resisting the temptation to treat one side casually. <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a> declares, &#8220;I, the LORD, do not change,&#8221; and that unchanging character shows up in uniform craftsmanship.<p>&#8226; Corners bear weight and set alignment for everything else; if corners are off, the whole building skews (<a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>). By crafting both corners identically, Bezalel obeyed God&#8217;s blueprints precisely (<a href="/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30-35</a>), reminding us that partial obedience is not enough.<p>&#8226; Christ is &#8220;the chief cornerstone&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6</a>). The perfect corners of the tabernacle point ahead to His flawless, load-bearing sufficiency for the entire household of faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/36-29.htm">Exodus 36:29</a> highlights meticulous unity: two frames firmly joined, bonded all the way up, locked by one ring, duplicated on both corners. God engineered His earthly dwelling to stand secure, move when He moved, and reflect His unchanging nature. Today He still unites believers from the ground up, holds us together under one Lord, and forms us into a stable, mobile sanctuary where His glory resides.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/36-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They were</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
