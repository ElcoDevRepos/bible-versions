It is situated between the Red Sea and Mount Sinai. The name "Elim" means "terebinths" or "trees," indicating a place of natural abundance. This stop is significant as it provided a place of rest and refreshment for the Israelites after the hardships they faced in the wilderness. The journey to Elim follows the bitter waters of Marah, where God miraculously provided sweet water, symbolizing His provision and care.<p><b>where there were twelve springs of water</b><br>The twelve springs of water at Elim can be seen as a symbol of God's provision and completeness, as the number twelve often represents completeness or the tribes of Israel in biblical numerology. This abundance of water would have been a significant relief for the Israelites, who had just experienced the scarcity of water at Marah. The springs also prefigure the living water that Jesus offers, as seen in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, where He speaks of the water that leads to eternal life.<p><b>and seventy palm trees</b><br>The seventy palm trees at Elim provide shade and sustenance, symbolizing rest and refreshment. The number seventy is often associated with the nations of the world, as seen in the Table of Nations in <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>. This could imply a foreshadowing of God's provision not only for Israel but for all nations. The palm tree is also a symbol of victory and triumph, which can be connected to the ultimate victory found in Christ.<p><b>and they camped there by the waters</b><br>Camping by the waters signifies a period of rest and rejuvenation for the Israelites. This temporary settlement allowed them to recover and prepare for the next stage of their journey. It reflects God's pattern of providing rest for His people, as seen in the Sabbath and ultimately in the rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).

He does not leave His people wandering aimlessly; He brings them to prepared refreshment, much like He led Abram to the promised land (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-7</a>) and later guided Elijah to a brook in famine (<a href="/1_kings/17-2.htm">1 Kings 17:2-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The shift from scarcity to abundance underlines <a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-2</a>: &#8220;The LORD is my shepherd &#8230; He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside still waters.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Twelve springs of water</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; where there were twelve springs of water &#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-27.htm">Exodus 15:27</a>)<p>&#8226; The springs are literal wells bubbling up in a desert setting&#8212;physical proof that God provides exactly what is needed.<p>&#8226; The number twelve naturally reminds us of the twelve tribes (<a href="/bsb/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>). Each tribe could draw from its own spring, underscoring God&#8217;s individual care within the larger covenant family (<a href="/numbers/2-2.htm">Numbers 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Other moments of divinely supplied water reinforce the picture: water from the rock at Rephidim (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>), Moses striking the rock at Kadesh (<a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>), and ultimately Jesus promising living water to every believer (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Seventy palm trees</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; and seventy palm trees &#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-27.htm">Exodus 15:27</a>)<p>&#8226; Palms offer both shade and nourishment (dates), depicting complete refreshment.<p>&#8226; The number seventy recalls Jacob&#8217;s family entering Egypt (<a href="/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>) and the seventy elders who later help Moses govern (<a href="/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16-17</a>). It points to fullness and representative leadership.<p>&#8226; In the New Testament, Jesus sends out seventy disciples (<a href="/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>), hinting that God uses groups of seventy to advance His purposes. The palms at Elim foreshadow this pattern of well-supplied, God-appointed leadership.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They camped there by the waters</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; and they camped there by the waters.&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-27.htm">Exodus 15:27</a>)<p>&#8226; Rest is as much a gift as the water itself.

Elim is refreshing but not the final destination. In the same way, believers enjoy seasons of rest yet press on toward the ultimate rest in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-11</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/15-27.htm">Exodus 15:27</a> is a snapshot of God&#8217;s faithfulness: He guides His people to a literal oasis, supplies abundance symbolized by twelve springs and seventy palms, and invites them to rest. The verse reassures us that the Lord who redeemed Israel from Egypt also sustains, refreshes, and leads, providing for both collective needs and individual tribes&#8212;all on the way to the promised land.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Elim</span>--the next stage to Marah, where there were "twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees"--seems to be rightly identified with the Wady Ghurundel in which "abundant grass grows thick and high," where acacias and tamarisks are plentiful, and in which, notwithstanding the ruthless denudation of the country by the Arabs, there are still a certain number of palm-trees. These are not now "seventy" in number, neither are they the ideal palm-trees of pictures, or even such as grow in the Valley of the Nile and in Upper Egypt generally. They are "either dwarf--that is, trunkless--or else with savage hairy trunks, and branches all dishevelled" (Stanley: <span class= "ital">Sinai and</span> <span class= "ital">Palestine, </span>p. 68)--specimens of the palm-tree growing under difficulties. The exact number of "twelve wells," which is mentioned in the text, cannot now be traced with any distinctness; but there is a perennial brook which supports the vegetation through the whole of the year, and in the winter-time there is a large stream which flows down to the sea through the wady.--(Niebuhr: <span class= "ital">Description de l'Arabie, </span>p. 347.)<p><span class= "bld">They encamped there.</span>--The head-quarters of the camp were at Elim (Wady Ghurundel); probably the mass of the people filled all the neighbouring wadys, as those of Useit, Ethal, and Tayibeh, or Shuweikah, which are all fertile, and have good pasturage.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They came to Elim</span>. Elim was undoubtedly some spot in the comparatively fertile tract which lies south of the "wilderness of Shur," intervening between it and the "wilderness of Sin" - now E1 Murkha. This tract contains the three fertile wadys of Ghurundel, Useit, and Tayibeh, each of which is regarded by some writers as the true Elim. It has many springs of water, abundant tamarisks, and a certain number of palm-trees. On the whole, Ghurundel seems to be accepted by the majority of well-informed writers as having the best claim to be considered the Elhn of this passage <span class="cmt_word">Twelve wells</span>. Rather "springs." The "twelve springs" have not been identified; but the Arabs are apt to conceal the sources of their water supplies (Niebuhr, Arabie, p. 347). A large stream flows down the Wady Ghurundel in the winter-time (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>), which later becomes a small brook (Burckhardt, <span class="accented">Syria</span>, p. 778), and dries up altogether in the autumn. The pasture is good at most seasons, sometimes rich and luxuriant; there are abundant tamarisks, a considerable number of acacias, and. some palms. <span class="cmt_word">Three score and ten palm trees</span>. The palm-trees of this part of Arabia are "not like those of Egypt or of pictures, but either dwarf - that is, truntdess - or else with savage hairy trunks, and branches all dishevelled" (Stanley, <span class="accented">Sinai and Palestine</span>, p. 68). There are a considerable number in the Wady Ghurundel, and others in the Wady Tayibeh (<span class="accented">ib</span>, p. 69). <span class="cmt_word">They encamped there</span>. It has been observed that the vast numbers of the host would more than fill the Wady Ghurundel, and that while the main body encamped there, others, with their cattle, probably occupied the adjacent wadys - Useit, Ethal, and even Tayibeh or Shuweikah - which all offer good pasturage <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/15-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then they came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
