His acknowledgment of the LORD's supremacy is significant, as it reflects a recognition of Yahweh's power over the pantheon of gods worshiped in the ancient Near East. This statement aligns with the first commandment given later in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>, emphasizing monotheism. The phrase also echoes the theme of God's superiority demonstrated through the plagues in Egypt, where each plague targeted specific Egyptian deities, showcasing Yahweh's dominance.<p><b>for He did this</b><br>The "this" refers to the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, a pivotal event in biblical history. The Exodus is a foundational narrative for Israel, symbolizing God's power and faithfulness. It serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where Jesus delivers humanity from the bondage of sin. The miraculous nature of the Exodus, including the parting of the Red Sea, underscores God's intervention in human history.<p><b>when they treated Israel with arrogance.</b><br>The Egyptians' arrogance is highlighted in their oppression of the Israelites, as seen in <a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8-14</a>. Pharaoh's refusal to release the Israelites despite numerous warnings and plagues exemplifies this arrogance. This phrase underscores a recurring biblical theme: God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).

There is no "he was above them" in the original, nor is the clause a distinct sentence from the preceding one. It is merely a prolongation of that clause, without any new verb; and should be translated, "Even in the very matter that they (the Egyptians) dealt proudly against them "(the Israelites). The superiority of Jehovah to other gods was shown forth even in the very matter of the proud dealing of the Egyptians, which was brought to shame and triumphed over by the might of Jehovah. The allusion is especially to the passage of the Red Sea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/18-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6258.htm">Strong's 6258: </a> </span><span class="str2">At this time</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1428;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is greater</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1464;&#1491;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1419.htm">Strong's 1419: </a> </span><span class="str2">Great, older, insolent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">than all other</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mik&#183;k&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
