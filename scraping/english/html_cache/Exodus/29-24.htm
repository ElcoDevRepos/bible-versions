The act of placing the offerings in their hands symbolizes the transfer of responsibility and authority for the priestly duties. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the hands were often seen as a symbol of power and action. This act signifies the beginning of their service to God, highlighting the importance of the priesthood in mediating between God and the Israelites. The priesthood of Aaron and his sons is a type of the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ, who is our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>and wave them before the LORD</b><br>The wave offering was a specific type of offering in which the priest would move the offering back and forth before the altar. This act symbolized presenting the offering to God and acknowledging His sovereignty. The wave offering was a way to show that the offering was dedicated to God and set apart for His purposes. This ritual act is a reminder of the need for dedication and consecration in worship. The waving motion can also be seen as a gesture of giving and receiving, symbolizing the relationship between God and His people.<p><b>as a wave offering</b><br>The wave offering was part of the larger sacrificial system established in the Mosaic Law. It was often associated with peace offerings and was a way to express gratitude and fellowship with God. The wave offering was not burned on the altar but was given to the priests for their sustenance, signifying God's provision for those who serve Him. This offering points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself once for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>), fulfilling the sacrificial system and establishing a new covenant between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

Aaron and his sons thus performed their first priestly act, as passive instruments in Moses' hands, by his muscular energy. Their priestly character was by these means made complete. (On "wave offerings," see Note upon <a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm" title="His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.">Leviticus 7:30</a>.)<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt put all in the hands</span>, or "<span class="accented">on</span> the hands." The offerings were to be laid first, on the hands of Aaron, and then on those of his sons, which were to support them; while Moses, putting his hands under theirs, made a waving motion with them towards the four corners of the heavens, to indicate that the gifts were offered to the omnipresent God. This process was that "filling of the hand," by which the actual installation in office took place. Moses, by the act, transferred the priestly functions, which he had hitherto exercised, to his brother and his brother's descendants. He made them by his muscular energy perform their first priestly act. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/29-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Put</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#347;am&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
