The shekel was a standard unit of weight and currency in ancient Israel. The use of silver here is consistent with its symbolic representation of redemption and atonement throughout the Bible. In <a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>, each Israelite was required to give a half-shekel as a ransom for his life, which was used for the service of the tabernacle. This silver, therefore, represents the collective contribution of the Israelites, symbolizing their unity and shared responsibility in worship.<p><b>he made the hooks for the posts</b><br>The hooks were essential for the structure of the tabernacle, as they were used to hang the curtains that formed the walls of the sacred space. The posts and hooks provided the framework that held the tabernacle together, symbolizing the support and order necessary for worship. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the cornerstone and foundation of the Church, holding it together (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20-22</a>).<p><b>overlaid their tops</b><br>Overlaying the tops of the posts with silver not only added beauty and value but also served a practical purpose of protection against the elements. This act of overlaying can be seen as a reflection of God's covering and protection over His people. In a broader sense, it points to the glory and holiness of God, as silver is often associated with purity and refinement (<a href="/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>).<p><b>and supplied bands for them</b><br>The bands provided additional support and stability to the structure, ensuring that the posts remained upright and secure. This detail emphasizes the importance of strength and unity in the community of believers. The bands can be seen as a metaphor for the bonds of love and peace that hold the body of Christ together (<a href="/colossians/3-14.htm">Colossians 3:14</a>). The meticulous attention to detail in the construction of the tabernacle reflects God's desire for order and precision in worship, as well as His provision for every need of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.
