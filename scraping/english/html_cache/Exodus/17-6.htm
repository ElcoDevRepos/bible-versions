Horeb is another name for Mount Sinai, a significant location in Israel's history where Moses would later receive the Ten Commandments. The rock at Horeb symbolizes a place of divine encounter and provision. God's promise to stand before Moses signifies His authority and assurance of His power to provide. This event foreshadows Christ, the Rock, who provides living water (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>).<p><b>And when you strike the rock,</b><br>Striking the rock is an act of obedience and faith on Moses' part. It demonstrates the necessity of human action in response to divine instruction. The act of striking can be seen as a type of Christ's suffering, where He was "struck" for our transgressions (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>). The rock, representing Christ, being struck to bring forth water, prefigures the crucifixion, where Christ's sacrifice brings forth spiritual life.<p><b>water will come out of it for the people to drink.&#8221;</b><br>Water symbolizes life and sustenance, essential for the survival of the Israelites in the desert. This miraculous provision highlights God's care and ability to meet the needs of His people. It also points to Jesus' offer of living water, which quenches spiritual thirst (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10, 14</a>). The provision of water from the rock is a testament to God's faithfulness and a reminder of His covenant with Israel.<p><b>So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.</b><br>Moses' obedience in the presence of the elders serves as a witness to God's power and faithfulness. The elders represent the leadership and authority within the community, and their presence validates the miracle. This public demonstration reinforces the trustworthiness of Moses as God's chosen leader and the reliability of God's promises. It also serves as a teaching moment for the Israelites, emphasizing the importance of faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.
