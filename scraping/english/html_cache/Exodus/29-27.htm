The act of consecration is significant in the biblical context as it denotes holiness and dedication to God&#8217;s service. Aaron and his sons were chosen by God to serve as priests, a role that required them to be set apart from the rest of the Israelites. This consecration is a foreshadowing of the New Testament concept of believers being a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>the breast of the wave offering that is waved</b><br>The wave offering involved the priest waving the offering before the Lord, symbolizing the presentation of the offering to God. The breast of the wave offering was a portion of the sacrifice given to the priests, signifying God's provision for those who serve Him. This act of waving can be seen as a gesture of dedication and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. The wave offering is also a type of Christ, who was lifted up on the cross and presented before God as the ultimate sacrifice.<p><b>and the thigh of the heave offering that is lifted up</b><br>The heave offering involved lifting a portion of the sacrifice as an offering to God. The thigh, or shoulder, was another part of the sacrifice given to the priests. This lifting up signifies the elevation of the offering to God, acknowledging His authority and ownership over all. The heave offering, like the wave offering, points to Christ, who was lifted up in His resurrection and ascension, fulfilling the sacrificial system.<p><b>from the ram of ordination</b><br>The ram of ordination was a specific sacrifice used in the consecration ceremony of the priests. This sacrifice was part of a larger ritual that included washing, anointing, and clothing the priests, symbolizing purification and preparation for service. The ram, as a sacrificial animal, is a type of Christ, who is the Lamb of God, sacrificed for the sins of the world. The ordination of Aaron and his sons prefigures the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who mediates between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, appointed as the first high priest of Israel.

Aaron and his sons, already chosen as priests (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>), are to be visibly marked as holy. This idea of separation echoes <a href="/leviticus/20-7.htm">Leviticus 20:7-8</a>, where Israel is told, &#8220;Consecrate yourselves, therefore, and be holy.&#8221; In practical terms:<p>&#8226; The priests&#8217; service cannot be casual or common; everything about their role is dedicated to God&#8217;s glory.<p>&#8226; Their consecration points forward to Christ, our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-27</a>), and to the believer&#8217;s calling to be &#8220;a royal priesthood&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the breast of the wave offering that is waved</b><p>The &#8220;breast&#8221; is specified because it represents the seat of affection. God assigns it to the priests after it is &#8220;waved&#8221; before Him&#8212;lifted horizontally and moved back and forth to symbolize presentation and acceptance. Similar motions appear in <a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30-31</a>. Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s portion is acknowledged first; only then may the priests receive their portion (<a href="/numbers/18-11.htm">Numbers 18:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The priestly share underscores God&#8217;s provision for those who serve at His altar (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the thigh of the heave offering that is lifted up</b><p>The &#8220;thigh&#8221; (or right shoulder) is the strongest part of the animal, lifted vertically as a &#8220;heave&#8221; offering (<a href="/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32-34</a>). Together with the breast, it teaches:<p>&#8226; The Lord receives both the affections (breast) and the strength (thigh) of His people.<p>&#8226; By giving the choicest cuts to the priests, God models generosity and care (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the ram of ordination</b><p>This specific animal seals the priests&#8217; installation (<a href="/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1-3</a>). The ram&#8217;s life is devoted entirely to launching their lifelong ministry. Parallels include:<p>&#8226; The ram offered in <a href="/bsb/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>, foreshadowing substitutionary sacrifice.<p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s once-for-all offering, securing an eternal priesthood for believers (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/29-27.htm">Exodus 29:27</a> instructs that select portions of the ordination ram&#8212;the breast and thigh&#8212;be set apart for Aaron and his sons after being formally presented to the LORD. The verse highlights God&#8217;s holiness, His provision for those who serve Him, and the pattern of dedicating both love and strength to Him. Ultimately, it points ahead to Jesus, whose perfect sacrifice consecrates all who trust in Him for priestly service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">THE LAW OF THE WAVE AND HEAVE OFFERINGS, AND OF THE CONSECRATION GARMENTS.</span><p>(27, 28) <span class= "bld">The wave offering.</span>--For the future, in every case of offerings made at a consecration, both the breast and the right shoulder (<a href="/leviticus/7-32.htm" title="And the right shoulder shall you give to the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.">Leviticus 7:32</a>) were to be given to the officiating priest, who was to "wave" the one and "heave" the other before the Lord.

For the future both the breast and the right shoulder are to belong to the priests. The shoulder, moreover, is to be "heaved," and only the breast "waved; .... heaving" being a single lifting up of the offering towards heaven, while" waving" was a repeated movement in a horizontal direction. Wave and heave offerings are always connected with the portions of the priests, or with things dedicated to God's service.
