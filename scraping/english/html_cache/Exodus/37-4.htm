Acacia trees were common in the Sinai region, making the wood readily available for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The poles were essential for transporting the Ark of the Covenant, ensuring it was carried without being touched directly, which aligns with the holiness and reverence required in handling sacred objects. This practice underscores the importance of obedience to God's instructions, as seen in the detailed commands given to Moses on Mount Sinai.<p><b>and overlaid them with gold.</b><br>Gold, a symbol of purity, divinity, and kingship, was used extensively in the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings. The overlaying of the acacia wood with gold signifies the divine nature and glory of God, as well as the preciousness of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This act of overlaying also points to the future glory of Christ, who is both fully human (represented by the wood) and fully divine (represented by the gold). The use of gold in the Tabernacle foreshadows the heavenly sanctuary and the eternal kingdom of God, where His glory is fully revealed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings.
