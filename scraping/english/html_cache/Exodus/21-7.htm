This was not akin to slavery as understood in modern terms but was more of a contractual agreement. The father, as the head of the household, had the authority to make such decisions, reflecting the patriarchal structure of society. This practice was intended to provide for the daughter&#8217;s welfare and future, often leading to marriage within the household she served. The cultural context of the time saw this as a means of ensuring the daughter&#8217;s security and integration into a stable family environment.<p><b>she is not to go free as the menservants do</b><br>The distinction between female and male servants highlights the different social roles and expectations in ancient Israelite society. Male servants were often released after six years of service, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>, reflecting the sabbatical cycle. However, female servants, particularly those sold by their fathers, were often intended to become part of the family, either through marriage or long-term servitude. This provision ensured that women were not left without support or protection, recognizing their vulnerability in a patriarchal society. The law aimed to safeguard the dignity and future of the female servant, ensuring she was not treated merely as property but as a potential member of the household.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Exodus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai and communicated them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws were given, living in a covenant relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant.htm">Servant (Hebrew: ?????, 'amah')</a></b><br>Refers to a female servant or maidservant, often in the context of servitude due to economic hardship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the Ten Commandments and other laws from God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_near_east.htm">Ancient Near East</a></b><br>The cultural and historical context in which these laws were given, where servitude was a common practice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_cultural_context.htm">Understanding Cultural Context</a></b><br>Recognize that the laws in Exodus were given in a specific historical and cultural context.

In ancient Israel, extreme poverty could force a family to place a child in indentured service. This practice was regulated by God to protect the vulnerable (compare <a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-41</a>).<p>&#8226; The sale was not for exploitation but for provision and protection within another household, much like Ruth&#8217;s kinsman-redeemer situation (<a href="/ruth/3-1.htm">Ruth 3:1-13</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law here acknowledges human hardship while setting boundaries so the daughter&#8217;s dignity remains intact&#8212;unlike the harsh chattel slavery known elsewhere (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She is not to go free</b><p>&#8226; Unlike a male servant who automatically received release after six years (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-15</a>), a daughter-servant&#8217;s status continued until redemption or marriage.<p>&#8226; This extended term ensured stability and future security, often ending in marriage to the master or his son (<a href="/exodus/21-8.htm">Exodus 21:8-9</a>).

A daughter-servant either married into the household or was redeemed, positioning her for long-term provision (compare <a href="/proverbs/31-21.htm">Proverbs 31:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Thus, the phrase &#8220;as the menservants do&#8221; highlights complementary, not inferior, treatment&#8212;each according to need.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/21-7.htm">Exodus 21:7</a> shows God&#8217;s compassionate regulation of indentured service.

Among the Hebrews such sales were, comparatively speaking, rare; but still they occasionally took place, in consequence of extreme poverty (<a href="/nehemiah/5-5.htm" title="Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children: and, see, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.">Nehemiah 5:5</a>). Women sold in this way might claim their freedom at the end of six years if they chose (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-17.htm" title="Then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant for ever. And also to your maidservant you shall do likewise.">Deuteronomy 15:17</a>); but if purchased to be wives, they received a further protection. If the intention were carried out, they were to be entitled to the status of wives during their whole lifetime, even though their husbands contracted further marriages (<a href="/exodus/21-10.htm" title="If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.">Exodus 21:10</a>). If, instead of becoming the wife of her purchaser, a woman was made over by him to his son, she was to enjoy all the rights of a daughter (<a href="/exodus/21-9.htm" title="And if he have betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.">Exodus 21:9</a>). If the purchaser declined to act in either of these two ways, he was compelled to take one of two other courses. Either he must get another Hebrew to discharge his obligation of marriage (<a href="/exodus/21-8.htm" title="If she please not her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her to a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.">Exodus 21:8</a>), or he must return the maid intact to her father, without making any demand for the restitution of the purchase-money (<a href="/exodus/21-11.htm" title="And if he do not these three to her, then shall she go out free without money.">Exodus 21:11</a>). These provisions afforded a considerable protection to the slave-concubine, who might otherwise have been liable to grievous wrong and oppression. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a man sell his</span> <span class="cmt_word">daughter to be a</span> <span class="cmt_word">maid-servant.</span> Among ancient nations the father' s rights over his children were generally regarded as including the right to sell them for slaves. In civilised nations the right was seldom exercised; but what restrained men was rather a sentiment of pride than any doubt of such sales being proper. Many barbarous nations, like the Thracians (Herod. 5:6), made a regular practice of selling their daughters. Even at Athens there was a time when sales of children had been common (Plut. <span class="accented">Vit. Solon</span>. &sect; 13). Existing custom, it is clear, sanctioned such sales among the Hebrews, and what the law now did was to step in and mitigate the evil consequences. (Compare the comment on verse 2.) These were greatest in the case of females. Usually they were bought to be made the concubines, or secondary wives of their masters. If this intention were carried out, then they were to be entitled to their status and maintenance as wives during their lifetime, even though their husband took another (legitimate) wife (ver. 10). If the retention was not carried out, either the man was to marry her to one of his sons (ver. 9), or he was to sell his rights over her altogether with his obligations to another Hebrew; or he was to send her back at once <span class="accented">intact</span> to her father' s house, without making any claim on him to refund the purchase-money.
