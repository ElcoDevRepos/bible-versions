The context for this separation is not explicitly detailed in the text, but it is understood that Moses sent her back to her father, Jethro, for safety or due to the challenges of his mission in Egypt. This action reflects the difficult circumstances Moses faced as he led the Israelites out of Egypt. The sending back of Zipporah may also suggest a temporary prioritization of his divine mission over family life, a theme seen in other biblical narratives where God's calling requires personal sacrifice.<p><b>his father-in-law Jethro had received her</b><br>Jethro, also known as Reuel, was a priest of Midian and Moses' father-in-law. His reception of Zipporah and her children indicates a supportive family relationship and highlights the cultural practice of extended family networks providing care and protection. Jethro's role as a priest suggests he was a man of wisdom and influence, which is later demonstrated when he advises Moses on leadership and governance (<a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-27</a>).

Compare the similar protective separations in <a href="/genesis/45-9.htm">Genesis 45:9&#8211;11</a> and <a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31&#8211;32</a>.<p>&#8226; Sending her back likely followed the tense circumcision episode en route to Egypt (<a href="/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24-26</a>), after which Zipporah may have questioned continued travel.
