Moses' instructions were based on God's command (<a href="/exodus/3-21.htm">Exodus 3:21-22</a>). This obedience is significant as it demonstrates faith in God's promises and leadership. It also sets a precedent for the importance of following divine guidance, a theme that recurs throughout the Bible.<p><b>and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold,</b><br>The request for silver and gold is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>, where God foretold that his descendants would leave their place of bondage with great possessions. This act can be seen as a form of divine reparation for the years of slavery. The wealth acquired would later be used in the construction of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25:1-8</a>), symbolizing the use of earthly wealth for divine purposes. The Egyptians' willingness to give these items may reflect God's influence over their hearts (<a href="/exodus/12-36.htm">Exodus 12:36</a>).<p><b>and for clothing.</b><br>Clothing was a valuable commodity in ancient times, often signifying wealth and status. The request for clothing indicates a preparation for the journey ahead, ensuring that the Israelites were equipped for their exodus from Egypt. This provision also symbolizes God's care for His people, ensuring they had what they needed for their journey to the Promised Land. The acquisition of clothing can be seen as a precursor to the spiritual "clothing" of righteousness that believers receive through faith in Christ (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the children of Israel, who were enslaved in Egypt and are now preparing to leave after the Passover.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

God had announced the final plague and the imminent departure (<a href="/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4&#8211;7</a>; 12:1&#8211;13). By adding this transitional word, Scripture reminds us that every detail fits into God&#8217;s unfolding plan. What follows is not a random act; it is the next step in the deliverance He promised back in <a href="/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a> and reiterated in <a href="/exodus/3-21.htm">Exodus 3:21&#8211;22</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Israelites acted</b><p>Israel&#8217;s response highlights simple, prompt obedience:<p>&#8226; Earlier they had &#8220;went and did so&#8221; concerning the Passover lamb (<a href="/exodus/12-28.htm">Exodus 12:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Now they move again, showing faith expressed through action, a pattern echoed later in <a href="/joshua/1-16.htm">Joshua 1:16&#8211;17</a> and <a href="/james/2-22.htm">James 2:22</a>.<p>Their readiness contrasts sharply with Pharaoh&#8217;s repeated hesitations, underlining that obedience leads to freedom while stubbornness brings judgment (<a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On Moses&#8217; word</b><p>They followed &#8220;Moses&#8217; word,&#8221; recognizing his God-given authority. This mirrors earlier scenes where Moses speaks and plagues fall (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;11</a>). The people&#8217;s submission foreshadows the New Testament call to heed God&#8217;s appointed messengers (<a href="/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7, 17</a>). It also fulfills the Lord&#8217;s assurance to Moses in <a href="/exodus/4-12.htm">Exodus 4:12</a>: &#8220;I will help you speak and will teach you what to say&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And asked the Egyptians</b><p>Requesting valuables from their oppressors seems bold, yet God had prepared Egyptian hearts. <a href="/exodus/11-2.htm">Exodus 11:2</a> already instructed this request, and 12:36 records the Lord giving Israel &#8220;favor.&#8221; Similar divine favor appears when Joseph gains respect in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/39-21.htm">Genesis 39:21</a>) and when Nehemiah receives provisions from King Artaxerxes (<a href="/nehemiah/2-7.htm">Nehemiah 2:7-9</a>). The lesson: God can turn the hearts of even unbelieving authorities to bless His people (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For articles of silver and gold</b><p>These riches were not mere souvenirs. God later directs that same silver and gold for the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1-8</a>; 35:5, 22). What the enemy had hoarded would fund Israel&#8217;s worship. The principle resurfaces in <a href="/haggai/2-8.htm">Haggai 2:8</a>&#8212;&#8220;The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine&#8221;&#8212;and in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-8.htm">2 Corinthians 9:8</a> where God supplies every need for every good work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And for clothing</b><p>Garments were practical for a desert journey and symbolic of new identity. <a href="/deuteronomy/8-4.htm">Deuteronomy 8:4</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/9-21.htm">Nehemiah 9:21</a> note that Israel&#8217;s clothes did not wear out for forty years, underscoring supernatural provision. Later, clothing imagery describes righteousness bestowed by God (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>). Even here, the Lord begins dressing His redeemed people for a future as His holy nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35</a> captures one decisive moment: obedient Israelites, trusting Moses, receive treasures and clothing from a once-hostile nation. The verse showcases God&#8217;s faithfulness to earlier promises, His sovereignty over human hearts, and His purpose in providing resources that will fuel future worship. Obedience unlocks provision, and every gift given prepares God&#8217;s people for the journey and service ahead.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">They borrowed.</span>--See the comment on <a href="/exodus/3-22.htm" title="But every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that sojournes in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters; and you shall spoil the Egyptians.">Exodus 3:22</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses</span>.

It is plain that the gold and silver articles and the raiment, were free-will gifts, which the Egyptians never expected to see again, and which the Hebrews asked and took, but in no sense "borrowed." Hengstenberg and Kurtz have shown clearly that the primary meaning of the words translated "borrowed" and "lent," is "asked" and "granted," and that the sense of "borrowing" and "lending" is only to be assigned them when it is required by the context. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/12-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Furthermore, the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
