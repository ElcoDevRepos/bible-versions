In the ancient Near Eastern context, servants or slaves were considered part of the household, and their well-being was tied to the economic stability of the family. The law here implies a period of observation to determine the severity of the injury. This reflects a legal principle of assessing the outcome before determining culpability, similar to other ancient legal codes like the Code of Hammurabi. The phrase also suggests a measure of time for healing, indicating that the injury was not fatal.<p><b>the owner shall not be punished,</b><br>The absence of punishment for the owner if the servant recovers indicates a legal distinction between accidental harm and intentional murder. This reflects the broader biblical principle of justice, where intent and outcome are both considered. The law aims to balance the rights of the servant with the economic interests of the owner. This principle is echoed in other parts of the Mosaic Law, where restitution and proportional justice are emphasized (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>).<p><b>since the servant is his property.</b><br>This phrase reflects the cultural and legal realities of the time, where servants were considered property under the law. This status is not an endorsement of slavery but a recognition of the social and economic structures of the ancient world. The Bible elsewhere provides principles that would eventually undermine the institution of slavery, such as the equality of all people before God (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>) and the call to love one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>).
