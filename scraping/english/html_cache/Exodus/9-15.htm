It suggests that God has been patient and deliberate in His actions. The plagues were not random but were part of a divine plan to demonstrate His power and sovereignty over Egypt and its gods.<p><b>I could have stretched out My hand</b><br>The "hand" of God is a metaphor for His power and intervention in human affairs. In biblical terms, God's hand represents His ability to execute judgment or deliverance. This phrase emphasizes God's control over the situation and His ability to act decisively.<p><b>and struck you and your people</b><br>This refers to Pharaoh and the Egyptians. The plagues were directed at both the leader and the nation, highlighting the collective responsibility and the widespread impact of their actions. It also underscores the personal nature of God's judgment against those who oppose His will.<p><b>with a plague</b><br>Plagues were common in the ancient Near East and were often seen as acts of divine judgment. Each plague in Exodus was a direct challenge to the Egyptian gods, demonstrating the futility of their worship. This particular mention of a plague serves as a reminder of God's power to bring about destruction as a form of judgment.<p><b>to wipe you off the earth</b><br>This phrase indicates the severity of the potential judgment. It echoes the language of total destruction found in other parts of the Old Testament, such as the flood narrative in Genesis. It serves as a warning of the ultimate consequences of continued rebellion against God.<p><b>and your people</b><br>The inclusion of "your people" highlights the communal aspect of sin and judgment. In the biblical context, leaders and their people were often seen as a unit, with the actions of one affecting the other. This reflects the interconnectedness of society and the far-reaching impact of leadership decisions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who speaks through Moses, demonstrating His power and authority over Egypt and its gods.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened against releasing the Israelites, serving as an instrument to display God's power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His message to Pharaoh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, and the setting for the plagues that demonstrate God's power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plagues.htm">The Plagues</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments sent by God to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites, showcasing His might and sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>God demonstrates His supreme authority over all creation, including the most powerful rulers and nations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_patience_and_justice.htm">Divine Patience and Justice</a></b><br>Despite having the power to destroy, God shows patience, giving Pharaoh multiple opportunities to repent and obey.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_judgment.htm">The Purpose of Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgments serve a dual purpose: to punish the wicked and to reveal His glory and power to the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_hardness_of_heart.htm">The Hardness of Heart</a></b><br>Pharaoh's hardened heart serves as a warning against resisting God's will and the consequences of pride and disobedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_people.htm">God's Faithfulness to His People</a></b><br>The plagues are a testament to God's commitment to His covenant with Israel, ensuring their deliverance and protection.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_9_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 9:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_15_God_s_power_over_creation.htm">How does Exodus 9:15 demonstrate God's power and authority over creation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_stretched_hand_show_God_s_patience.htm">What does "I could have stretched out My hand" reveal about God's patience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_15_link_to_Genesis_covenant.htm">How does Exodus 9:15 connect to God's covenant with Israel in Genesis?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_God_s_patience_daily.htm">How can we apply God's patience in Exodus 9:15 to our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_15_lessons_for_sharing_Gospel.htm">What lessons from Exodus 9:15 can guide us in sharing the Gospel today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_spare_Egyptians_despite_disobedience.htm">Why did God choose to spare the Egyptians despite their continued disobedience in Exodus 9:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_15_God_s_control_over_life_death.htm">How does Exodus 9:15 reflect God's sovereignty and power over life and death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_15_on_God_s_patience_mercy.htm">What does Exodus 9:15 reveal about God's patience and mercy towards sinners?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_ten_plagues_in_the_bible.htm">What were the Ten Plagues of Egypt in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_are_revelation's_seven_trumpets.htm">What are Revelation's seven trumpets?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/if_god_hardened_pharaoh's_heart,_is_he_guilty.htm">(Exodus 11:9&#8211;10) If Pharaoh&#8217;s heart was divinely hardened, how is he personally culpable for resisting the requests to free the Israelites?

It is generally agreed by modern writers that this translation fails to give the true sense of the original God does not here announce what he is going to do, but what he might have done, and would have done, but for certain considerations. Translate, "For now might I have stretched out my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence; and then thou hadst been cut off from the earth." Scripture shows that pestilence is always in God's power, and may at any time be let loose to scourge his foes, and sweep them into the pit of destruction.
