The act of taking half of the blood signifies the importance of the covenant being established. Blood was often used in sacrificial rituals to signify purification and consecration. This act by Moses is a precursor to the sacrificial system that would be fully developed in Leviticus. It also foreshadows the New Covenant in Christ's blood, as referenced in <a href="/hebrews/9-18.htm">Hebrews 9:18-22</a>, where the shedding of blood is necessary for the remission of sins.<p><b>and put it in bowls</b><br>The collection of blood in bowls indicates preparation for a ritual act. Bowls were common vessels used in ancient sacrificial practices, and their use here suggests a formal and deliberate process. This preparation underscores the solemnity of the covenant ceremony. The use of bowls also allows for the blood to be used in a controlled and purposeful manner, highlighting the order and intentionality of God's covenant with His people.<p><b>and the other half he splattered on the altar</b><br>The altar represents the presence of God and is the place where sacrifices are offered. By splattering the blood on the altar, Moses is symbolically dedicating the covenant to God, signifying that it is a divine agreement. This act of splattering blood is a form of consecration, setting apart the altar and the covenant as holy. It also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed to establish a new and everlasting covenant, as seen in <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>. The altar, as a place of sacrifice, points to the cross where Christ's blood was poured out for the redemption of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the mediator of the covenant between God and His people.

The scene teaches that covenant relationship rests on shed blood&#8212;life given for life&#8212;pointing ahead to the perfect, once-for-all sacrifice of Christ, who fulfills both sides of the covenant and opens the way for His people to draw near with confidence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Put it in basons.</span>--Reserving it for the purpose stated in <a href="/exodus/24-8.htm" title="And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.">Exodus 24:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.</span>--This was the most essential part of every sacrifice--the act by which the victim, the representative of the offerer, was made over and delivered up to God.
