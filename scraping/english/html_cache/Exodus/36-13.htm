Gold, being a symbol of purity and value, reflects the holiness of God. The number fifty is significant in biblical numerology, often associated with the concept of jubilee and freedom, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>. The clasps served a practical purpose in joining the curtains, but they also symbolize unity and completeness in the divine design.<p><b>to join the curtains together</b><br>The curtains of the tabernacle were made of fine linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, representing the heavenly, royal, and sacrificial aspects of God's presence. The joining of the curtains with gold clasps signifies the unity and coherence of God's dwelling place among His people. This unity can be seen as a foreshadowing of the unity of believers in Christ, as described in <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3-6</a>, where the church is called to maintain the unity of the Spirit.<p><b>so that the tabernacle was a unit</b><br>The tabernacle as a unit represents the dwelling place of God among the Israelites, a central theme in the Old Testament. It was a portable sanctuary, reflecting God's desire to be present with His people as they journeyed through the wilderness. This unity of the tabernacle prefigures the unity of the body of Christ, the church, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>. The tabernacle's design and function point to Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence with humanity, as stated in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the construction of the tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_curtains.htm">The Curtains</a></b><br>Part of the tabernacle's structure, made of fine linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, symbolizing the beauty and holiness of God's dwelling.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gold_clasps.htm">The Gold Clasps</a></b><br>Used to join the curtains together, symbolizing unity and the preciousness of God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_body_of_christ.htm">Unity in the Body of Christ</a></b><br>Just as the gold clasps unified the curtains into one tabernacle, believers are called to be united in Christ, forming one body.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_god's_presence.htm">The Value of God's Presence</a></b><br>The use of gold signifies the preciousness of God's presence among His people.

Every clasp was fashioned of pure gold, the metal that pictures divinity and incorruptibility (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>). God directed Moses earlier, &#8220;Make fifty gold clasps and join the curtains with them&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/26-6.htm">Exodus 26:6</a>). By recording that Bezalel actually &#8220;made&#8221; them (<a href="/exodus/36-13.htm">Exodus 36:13</a>) the text confirms faithful obedience to God&#8217;s blueprint, echoing Noah&#8217;s precision in <a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a> and reminding us that genuine worship flows from doing God&#8217;s will exactly, not creatively altering it (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to join the curtains together</b><p>The ten inner curtains bore cherubim, portraying heaven&#8217;s throne room (<a href="/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>). Those panels were vast, yet without the clasps they would remain individual pieces. The joining shows how God weaves separate parts into a single sanctuary. David later celebrates the same truth: &#8220;He makes the two one&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>). In the New Covenant this foreshadows Christ, who &#8220;has made the two groups one&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>) and &#8220;holds the whole body together by every supporting ligament&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>). The clasps illustrate that unity is not optional d&#233;cor; it is built into God&#8217;s dwelling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that the tabernacle was a unit</b><p>The outcome is striking: &#8220;the tabernacle was a unit&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/36-13.htm">Exodus 36:13</a>). God&#8217;s house could only stand when every part was linked. <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a> says the earthly tabernacle was &#8220;a copy and shadow of the heavenly things,&#8221; so its unified fabric anticipates the perfected oneness of God&#8217;s eternal dwelling (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>). Paul applies the picture to believers: &#8220;In Him the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>). Just as one missing clasp would mar the sanctuary, willful disunity mars our witness (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/36-13.htm">Exodus 36:13</a> celebrates precise obedience, heavenly craftsmanship, and purposeful unity.
