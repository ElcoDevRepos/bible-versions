This phrase highlights Moses' obedience to God's command to confront Pharaoh. The act of speaking in God's name signifies authority and divine backing, yet Moses is perplexed by the lack of immediate success. This reflects the tension between divine promise and human expectation. The phrase also underscores the importance of God's name, which in the ancient Near Eastern context, represented His character and power. Moses' mission was not just a personal endeavor but a divine mandate.<p><b>he has brought trouble on this people</b><br>Pharaoh's response to Moses' request was to increase the Israelites' burdens, making their slavery even harsher. This phrase captures the immediate consequence of Moses' obedience, which was increased suffering for the Israelites. Historically, this reflects the oppressive nature of Egyptian rule over the Hebrews, who were forced into hard labor. Theologically, it illustrates the spiritual battle between God's purposes and the resistance of worldly powers. This trouble can be seen as a test of faith for both Moses and the Israelites, challenging them to trust in God's ultimate plan.<p><b>and You have not delivered Your people in any way.</b><br>Moses' lament here is a raw expression of doubt and disappointment. Despite God's promise of deliverance, the situation appears unchanged or even worse. This phrase highlights the theme of divine timing versus human impatience. It also foreshadows the eventual deliverance that God will accomplish, emphasizing that God's ways and timing are often beyond human understanding. This connects to the broader biblical narrative of waiting on God's promises, as seen in the lives of Abraham, Joseph, and later, the anticipation of the Messiah. Moses' words echo the cries of many believers who struggle with the apparent delay of God's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader of the Israelites, tasked by God to lead His people out of Egyptian bondage.

Yet the verse sets the stage for God&#8217;s dramatic intervention: Pharaoh&#8217;s cruelty will magnify the Lord&#8217;s glory, Israel&#8217;s despair will deepen their gratitude, and Moses&#8217; honesty will strengthen his reliance on God.
