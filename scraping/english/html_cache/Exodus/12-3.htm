The term "congregation" indicates a collective identity, emphasizing unity and shared purpose. This is the first time the term is used in the Bible, marking the beginning of Israel's national identity. The instruction is communal, highlighting the importance of collective obedience and participation in God's plan.<p><b>that on the tenth day of this month</b><br>The specific timing is significant, as it marks the beginning of the Jewish religious calendar with the month of Nisan (or Abib). The tenth day is chosen to allow time for the lamb to be selected and observed, ensuring it is without blemish. This timing also foreshadows the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, which occurred on the tenth day of Nisan, aligning with His role as the Lamb of God.<p><b>each man must select a lamb for his family</b><br>The selection of a lamb is a personal responsibility, emphasizing the role of the head of the household in spiritual leadership. The lamb is to be chosen with care, symbolizing purity and innocence. This act prefigures Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. The personal selection underscores the necessity of individual faith and commitment in the redemption process.<p><b>one per household</b><br>The provision of one lamb per household signifies the sufficiency of the sacrifice for each family unit. It reflects the communal aspect of salvation, where each household is covered by the blood of the lamb. This mirrors the New Testament teaching that Christ's sacrifice is sufficient for all who believe. The household focus also points to the importance of family in God's covenantal promises and the transmission of faith across generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Leaders of the Israelites, tasked by God to communicate His instructions to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_congregation_of_israel.htm">The Congregation of Israel</a></b><br>The collective body of the Israelites, who are in Egypt at this time, preparing for the first Passover.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tenth_day_of_the_month.htm">The Tenth Day of the Month</a></b><br>This specific timing is crucial as it marks the beginning of the preparation for the Passover.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamb.htm">The Lamb</a></b><br>A central element in the Passover, symbolizing sacrifice and redemption.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, and from which God is about to deliver them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>The Israelites were required to follow God's specific instructions for the Passover.
