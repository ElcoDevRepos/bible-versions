Straw was a crucial component in brick-making, as it provided the necessary binding material to hold the clay together. By withholding straw, Pharaoh increased the Israelites' workload, making their task nearly impossible. This decision reflects Pharaoh's attempt to suppress the Israelites' growing numbers and influence, as he feared their potential to rise against him (<a href="/exodus/1-9.htm">Exodus 1:9-10</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a test of faith and endurance for the Israelites, foreshadowing their eventual deliverance by God. The harshness of Pharaoh's decree also highlights the oppressive nature of sin and the bondage from which God seeks to free His people, drawing a parallel to the spiritual liberation offered through Jesus Christ.<p><b>They must go and gather their own straw.</b><br>This requirement added an immense burden to the Israelites, as they now had to spend additional time and effort gathering straw, while still meeting their original brick quotas. This reflects the increasing oppression and cruelty of the Egyptian regime. Historically, this aligns with the practices of ancient Egypt, where laborers were often subjected to harsh conditions. Theologically, this can be seen as a representation of the futility and burden of trying to achieve righteousness through human effort alone, without divine intervention. The Israelites' plight under Pharaoh's rule can be compared to the spiritual bondage of sin, from which Christ offers redemption. This situation also sets the stage for God's intervention through Moses, demonstrating His power and faithfulness in delivering His people from seemingly insurmountable circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who opposes Moses and the Israelites, representing the oppressive force against God's people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>God's chosen leaders to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, enslaved in Egypt, who are being oppressed by Pharaoh's harsh decrees.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, symbolizing a place of bondage and oppression.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/taskmasters.htm">Taskmasters</a></b><br>Egyptian overseers enforcing Pharaoh's harsh labor demands on the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_oppression.htm">Understanding Oppression</a></b><br>Pharaoh's decree to withhold straw symbolizes the increasing burden and oppression faced by God's people.

Denying it forces Israel to work twice: first to gather straw, then to mold bricks.<p>&#8226; The scene recalls <a href="/genesis/11-3.htm">Genesis 11:3</a>, where rebellious humanity boasted, &#8220;Come, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly,&#8221; highlighting the contrast between human pride and God&#8217;s purposes.<p>&#8226; Such grueling labor is never God&#8217;s design for His people.

Affliction sets the stage for deliverance, echoing <a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>: &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The contrast is sharp: Pharaoh burdens; Christ invites&#8212;&#8220;Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/5-7.htm">Exodus 5:7</a> marks Pharaoh&#8217;s calculated escalation of oppression: no more supplied straw, the same brick quota, and an impossible burden engineered to crush Israel&#8217;s spirit. Yet every withheld stalk of straw becomes a strand in God&#8217;s larger tapestry of redemption. The harder Pharaoh pushes, the nearer the day when God will split the sea and set His people free, proving once again that human tyranny can never thwart divine promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Straw to make brick.</span>--"The use of crude brick was general in Egypt for dwelling-houses, tombs, and ordinary buildings, the walls of towns, fortresses, and the sacred enclosures of temples, and for all purposes where stone was not required, which last was nearly confined to temples, quays, and reservoirs" (Wilkinson, in Rawlinson's <span class= "ital">Herodotus,</span> vol. ii. p. 213). These crude bricks were always made of the mud of the Nile, mixed with chopped straw, which served to bind them together (Rosellini, <span class= "ital">Monumenti Civili,</span> vol. ii. p. 252).<p><span class= "bld">Let them go and gather straw.</span>--It has been estimated that this requirement would "more than double" the people's toils (Canon Cook). They would have to disperse themselves over the harvest fields, often lying at a considerable distance from the brick-fields, to detach the straw from the soil, gather it into bundles, and convey it to the scene of their ordinary labours. Having done this they were then required to complete the ordinary "tale."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Straw to make brick</span>. Straw was used in Egypt to bind together the clay, or mud, which was, of course, the main material of the bricks. (See Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 2130 It is usually chopped into small pieces. <span class="cmt_word">Let them go and gather straw</span>. This would involve the leaving of the brickfields, and the scattering of the people over the harvest-grounds, where alone they would be able to find straw in any quantity. There are so many harvests in Egypt, that straw would perhaps be obtainable somewhere during the greater part of the year. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/5-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;You shall no</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">longer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1465;&#1488;&#1505;&#1460;&#1508;&#1438;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#333;&#183;si&#183;p&#772;&#363;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine plural &#124;
