Grazing was a common practice, and fields and vineyards were vital for sustenance and economic stability. The law underscores the importance of respecting others' property. In biblical times, agriculture was central to life, and fields and vineyards were often adjacent, making it easy for livestock to stray. This reflects the agrarian society of ancient Israel, where land was a primary resource.<p><b>and allows them to stray so that they graze in someone else&#8217;s field</b><br>The emphasis here is on negligence. The owner is responsible for controlling his animals. This principle of accountability is consistent with the broader biblical theme of stewardship. The act of straying implies a lack of vigilance, which can lead to damage and loss for the neighbor. This reflects the communal nature of ancient Israelite society, where one's actions could directly impact the community.<p><b>he must make restitution</b><br>Restitution is a key biblical principle, emphasizing justice and restoration. This requirement ensures that the wronged party is compensated for their loss. The concept of restitution is seen throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/leviticus/6.htm">Leviticus 6:1-7</a>, where offerings are made to atone for wrongs. It reflects God's justice and the importance of maintaining harmony within the community.<p><b>from the best of his own field or vineyard</b><br>This phrase highlights the quality of restitution required. The offender must compensate with the best of his produce, not just any portion. This ensures fairness and discourages negligence. The principle of offering the best is seen in other biblical contexts, such as the offerings to God in <a href="/leviticus/22-21.htm">Leviticus 22:21</a>.

This opening clause reminds us that even routine chores are lived before the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and allows them to stray</b><p>- &#8220;Allows&#8221; signals negligence, not an unavoidable accident. Like the owner of a goring ox who fails to pen it up (<a href="/exodus/21-29.htm">Exodus 21:29</a>), this person knows the risk but does nothing.<p>- God&#8217;s law respects personal responsibility; carelessness is never excused (<a href="/proverbs/28-18.htm">Proverbs 28:18</a>).<p>- By highlighting the owner&#8217;s choice, the verse reveals sin is often passive&#8212;simply failing to do what is right (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that they graze in someone else&#8217;s field</b><p>- The wandering herd tramples boundaries, violating a neighbor&#8217;s livelihood.

Two kinds of trespass alone are mentioned; but from these the principles to be followed in punishing trespass generally can be sufficiently made out. Accidental injury, such as that caused by fire extending from one man's field into another's, was to be simply compensated up to the amount of damage done; but voluntary injury, such as followed on the turning of beasts into a neighbour's ground, was to be more than compensated. The amount of produce destroyed was to be exactly calculated, and then the injurer was to make good the full amount of his neighbour's loss out of <span class= "ital">the best </span>of his own produce.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - LAW OF TRESPASS. - Next to theft, and not much behind it, is the wanton damage of what belongs to another - as when a person injures his neighbour's crops, either by turning beasts into his field, or by causing a conflagration in it. To turn beasts in was the more determinedly malicious act, and therefore the damage done was to be compensated by making over to the injured party a like quantity of produce out of the <span class="accented">best</span> that a man was possessed of; whereas simple restitution, was sufficient when fire had spread accidentally from a man's own land to his neighbour's.
