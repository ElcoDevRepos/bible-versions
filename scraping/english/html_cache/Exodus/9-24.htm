This event demonstrates God's power over nature, contrasting with the Egyptian gods who were believed to control the weather. Hail, a rare occurrence in Egypt due to its typically warm climate, signifies a divine intervention. The severity of the hailstorm underscores the seriousness of Pharaoh's hardened heart and God's judgment against Egypt.<p><b>and the lightning continued flashing through it.</b><br>The combination of hail and lightning indicates a supernatural storm, emphasizing the intensity and divine origin of the plague. Lightning, often associated with God's presence and power, can be seen in other biblical instances, such as at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). This imagery reinforces the idea of God's direct involvement and the awe-inspiring nature of His judgments.<p><b>The hail was so severe that nothing like it had ever been seen</b><br>This phrase highlights the unprecedented nature of the plague. The severity of the hailstorm serves as a testament to God's unmatched power and the seriousness of His warnings. It also acts as a sign to both the Egyptians and the Israelites of God's sovereignty and the futility of resisting His will.<p><b>in all the land of Egypt</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the widespread impact of the plague, affecting the entire nation. This widespread devastation would have had significant economic and social consequences, disrupting agriculture and daily life. It serves as a direct challenge to the Egyptian belief in the protection offered by their gods and the Pharaoh.<p><b>from the time it became a nation.</b><br>This reference to Egypt's history underscores the magnitude of the event. Egypt, known for its long and storied history, had never experienced such a calamity. This serves to remind the reader of God's control over history and His ability to intervene in the affairs of nations. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance of the Israelites, as God's power is demonstrated in unprecedented ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart was hardened against letting the Israelites go.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved, experiencing God's plagues as a demonstration of His power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hail.htm">Hail</a></b><br>The seventh plague sent by God upon Egypt, characterized by unprecedented severity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who were protected from the plagues affecting Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The severity of the hail demonstrates God's control over nature and His ability to execute judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment.htm">Divine Judgment</a></b><br>The plagues serve as a reminder of the consequences of hardening one's heart against God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/protection_for_god's_people.htm">Protection for God's People</a></b><br>Despite the widespread destruction, God protected the Israelites, showing His faithfulness to His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_obedience.htm">Repentance and Obedience</a></b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to repent highlights the importance of responding to God's warnings with humility and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_significance.htm">Historical Significance</a></b><br>The unprecedented nature of the hail underscores the historical reality of God's interventions in human history.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_9_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 9:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_24_God_s_power_nature_judgment.htm">How does Exodus 9:24 demonstrate God's power over nature and judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Egypt_s_severe_hailstorm.htm">What lessons can we learn from the severity of the hailstorm in Egypt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_24_s_link_to_Israel_s_covenant.htm">How does Exodus 9:24 connect to God's covenant with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Exodus_9_24_to_spirituality.htm">How can we apply the warning of Exodus 9:24 to our spiritual lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_unmatched_storm_show_God_s_uniqueness.htm">What does the phrase "never been such a storm" teach about God's uniqueness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_24_vs_Egypt_s_climate_history.htm">How does Exodus 9:24 align with historical and archaeological evidence of ancient Egypt's climate?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Hailstorm_s_role_in_God_s_power_in_Exodus.htm">What theological significance does the hailstorm in Exodus 9:24 hold for understanding God's power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_24_vs_God_s_love_conflict.htm">How does Exodus 9:24 challenge the belief in a loving and merciful God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/revelation_8_7__hail,_fire,_blood_possible.htm">In Revelation 8:7, how is hail and fire mixed with blood possible, and has anything like this been documented in history or science?

God Himself releases nature&#8217;s artillery.<p>- Earlier, Moses had stretched out his staff (<a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>), but the power behind the staff is the Lord who &#8220;treasures up His hail for the day of battle&#8221; (<a href="/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>- Just as Joshua later watched hailstones wipe out Amorite armies (<a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>), Egypt now experiences that same unmistakable judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the lightning continued flashing through it</b><p>- The storm is no ordinary downpour; lightning pulses through the cascade of ice. <a href="/psalms/97-4.htm">Psalm 97:4</a> reminds us that &#8220;His lightning lights up the world,&#8221; signaling divine presence and authority.<p>- The continuous flashes hint at relentless, sustained judgment&#8212;not a quick strike, but an extended display (<a href="/job/37-3.htm">Job 37:3</a>).<p>- Pharaoh&#8217;s false gods of sky and storm&#8212;such as Seth&#8212;are publicly outmatched; only the true God commands both hail and fire simultaneously (<a href="/revelation/16-18.htm">Revelation 16:18, 21</a> mirrors this dual force in the end-times plague).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The hail was so severe</b><p>- Scripture shifts from description to evaluation: &#8220;so severe.&#8221; Severity underscores total devastation&#8212;flax and barley beaten down (<a href="/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31</a>), trees shattered (<a href="/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>).<p>- God isn&#8217;t random; His judgments are measured to expose hardened hearts. In Egypt&#8217;s case, the seventh plague follows six rejected warnings (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;9</a>), underscoring escalating consequences.<p>- This severity anticipates the finality of God&#8217;s future judgments, where &#8220;great hailstones, about a hundred pounds each, fell from heaven&#8221; on the unrepentant (<a href="/revelation/16-21.htm">Revelation 16:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that nothing like it had ever been seen in all the land of Egypt</b><p>- Scripture invites comparison: unparalleled disaster. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-32.htm">Deuteronomy 4:32</a> asks Israel to consider &#8220;from the day God created man on the earth&#8221; whether any nation ever heard what they had heard; here, Egypt faces a similarly singular event.<p>- Later, the locust plague will receive the same &#8220;never before, never again&#8221; label (<a href="/exodus/10-14.htm">Exodus 10:14</a>). Each plague is unique, but the crescendo grows louder, emphasizing God&#8217;s supremacy over every Egyptian deity and natural force.<p>- The wording exposes human limitations: Egypt&#8217;s storied civilization, famed for pyramids and calendar precision, cannot recall a precedent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the time it became a nation</b><p>- Egypt dates its national story back centuries to the first dynasties; Scripture frames the plague against that full history. This isn&#8217;t hyperbole but a factual benchmark: in all recorded memory, nothing compares.<p>- The clause echoes God&#8217;s broader narrative plan. When He later forms Israel as a nation, He will perform equally unmatched wonders (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>).<p>- By referencing Egypt&#8217;s national birth, the text underscores that God&#8217;s sovereignty stretches across national timelines. Human empires rise, but their chronicles ultimately testify to His acts (<a href="/psalms/105-26.htm">Psalm 105:26&#8211;38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/9-24.htm">Exodus 9:24</a> captures a divinely engineered storm that crushes Egypt&#8217;s pride and proves the LORD&#8217;s unrivaled power. Hail falls by His command, lightning crackles nonstop, severity peaks beyond human experience, and the event stands unmatched in Egypt&#8217;s long history. The verse reminds every generation that the God who once shattered Pharaoh&#8217;s defenses still wields nature and history to reveal His supremacy and call hearts to humble obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) F<span class= "bld">ire mingled with the hail.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">a fire</span> <span class= "ital">infolding itself in the midst of the hail.</span> (Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4</a>; and see the comment on <a href="/exodus/9-23.htm" title="And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along on the ground; and the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt.">Exodus 9:23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span>- <span class="cmt_word">Fire mingled with the hail.</span> Rather, "There was hail, and in the midst of the hail a fire infolding itself."
