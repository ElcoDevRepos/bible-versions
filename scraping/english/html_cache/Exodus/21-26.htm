In the cultural and historical setting of the Israelites, servants were often part of the household economy, and their treatment was governed by specific laws. The law here emphasizes the value of human life and dignity, even for those in servitude. It contrasts with other ancient legal codes, such as the Code of Hammurabi, which also dealt with injuries but often with harsher penalties. The biblical law underscores a principle of justice and fairness, ensuring that even servants have rights and protections.<p><b>he must let the servant go free</b><br>This provision highlights the concept of restitution and justice within the Mosaic Law. The freedom granted to the servant serves as a form of compensation for the injury suffered. This reflects the biblical principle of lex talionis, or the law of retaliation, which is not about revenge but about proportional justice. The release of the servant can be seen as a type of redemption, a theme that runs throughout Scripture, pointing to the ultimate redemption found in Jesus Christ. The act of setting a servant free prefigures the spiritual liberation that Christ offers to all believers.<p><b>as compensation for the eye</b><br>The specific mention of the eye indicates the seriousness of the injury and the corresponding need for adequate compensation. In biblical symbolism, the eye often represents insight, understanding, and perception. The loss of an eye would significantly impact a person's ability to function and contribute to the household. This law ensures that the servant is not left without recourse or support. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's concern for justice and the protection of the vulnerable, as seen in other passages such as <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>, which speaks of God's care for the fatherless and the widow.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Exodus, who received the Law from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws were given, forming the covenant community of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>Individuals in servitude, often due to debt or poverty, within the Israelite community.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the Law from God, including the laws in <a href="/bsb/exodus/21.htm">Exodus 21</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who establishes justice and compassion through His commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_compassion.htm">Justice and Compassion</a></b><br>The law in <a href="/exodus/21-26.htm">Exodus 21:26</a> reflects God's justice and compassion, ensuring that even servants are treated with dignity and fairness.

The verse reveals a God who values every human life, insists on responsible authority, and weaves mercy and fairness into the fabric of His law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26, 27) <span class= "bld">The eye </span>. . . <span class= "bld">Tooth.</span>--An exception to the law of retaliation is here made. If the injurer is a free man and the injured person a slave, the marked social inequality of the parties would make exact retaliation an injustice. Is the slave, then, to be left without protection? By no means. As the legislation had already protected his life (<a href="/exodus/21-20.htm" title="And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.">Exodus 21:20</a>), so it now protects him from permanent damage to his person. The master who inflicts any such permanent damage--from the least to the greatest--loses all property in his slave, and is bound at once to emancipate him. The loss of an eye is viewed as the greatest permanent injury to the person; the loss of a tooth as the least.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - <span class="accented">Assaults on Slaves</span>. The general law of retaliation was not made to extend to slaves. For ordinary blows the slave was not thought entitled to compensation, any more than the child. They were natural incidents of his condition. In extremer cases, where he was permanently injured in an organ or a member, he was, however, considered to have ground of complaint and to deserve a recompense. But for him to revenge himself upon his master by inflicting the same on him was not to be thought cf. It would have put the slave into a false position, have led to his prolonged ill-treatment, and have been an undue degradation of the master. Therefore, compulsory emancipation was made the penalty of all such aggravated assaults, even the slightest (ver. 27). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a man smite the eye</span>, etc. The "eye" seems to be selected as the most precious of our organs, the "tooth" as that the loss of which is of least consequence. The principle was that any permanent loss of any part of his frame entitled the slave to his liberty. A very considerable check must have been put on the brutality of masters by this enactment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/21-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
