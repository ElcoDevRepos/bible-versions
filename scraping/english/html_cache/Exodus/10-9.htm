It highlights the communal aspect of worship and the importance of every generation in the covenant community. The mention of both young and old underscores the collective identity of the Israelites as God's chosen people, where every member, regardless of age, is integral to the fulfillment of God's promises. This inclusivity can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching that the Kingdom of God is open to all who believe, as seen in passages like <a href="/acts/2-39.htm">Acts 2:39</a>.<p><b>Moses replied.</b><br>Moses, as the leader and prophet, acts as the spokesperson for God and the Israelites. His role is pivotal in the narrative of the Exodus, serving as a mediator between God and Pharaoh. This reflects the typology of Moses as a precursor to Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). Moses' leadership is characterized by obedience to God's commands and a deep commitment to the liberation of his people.<p><b>We will go with our sons and daughters,</b><br>The inclusion of sons and daughters signifies the importance of family in the worship of God. It reflects the biblical principle that faith and religious practices are to be passed down through generations, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>. This also highlights the continuity of God's covenant promises, which are intended for future generations, ensuring the perpetuation of faith and obedience to God.<p><b>and with our flocks and herds,</b><br>The mention of flocks and herds indicates the necessity of these animals for sacrificial offerings, which were central to Israelite worship. This reflects the cultural and religious practices of the time, where sacrifices were a means of atonement and communion with God. The presence of flocks and herds also signifies the economic and social aspects of the Israelites' lives, as livestock were a primary source of wealth and sustenance.<p><b>for we must hold a feast to the LORD.</b><br>This phrase underscores the purpose of the Israelites' departure: to worship and celebrate a feast to the LORD. The feast likely refers to the Passover, which commemorates God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt. This act of worship is a response to God's mighty works and a fulfillment of His command. The concept of feasting in the presence of the LORD is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing fellowship, gratitude, and the acknowledgment of God's provision and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egyptian bondage.

God&#8217;s people cannot accept a &#8220;half-measure&#8221; liberty; salvation is total.<p>- Family solidarity under God&#8217;s covenant is at stake.
