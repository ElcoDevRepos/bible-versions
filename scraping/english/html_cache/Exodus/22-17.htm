The father's authority in these matters reflects the patriarchal structure of society. This phrase indicates the father's right to refuse a marriage proposal, even if the man has already taken the woman. This reflects the importance of family honor and the protection of daughters. The father's decision would be influenced by various factors, including the man's character and the family's social standing. This aligns with the broader biblical principle of parental authority and responsibility, as seen in passages like <a href="/genesis/24.htm">Genesis 24</a>, where Abraham's servant seeks Rebekah's family's consent for her marriage to Isaac.<p><b>the man still must pay an amount comparable to the bridal price of a virgin</b><br>The bridal price, or "mohar," was a customary payment made by the groom to the bride's family, symbolizing a formal agreement and the value placed on the bride. This payment served as a form of financial security for the bride. In this context, even if the marriage does not occur, the man is still required to pay this amount, acknowledging the seriousness of his actions and the potential damage to the woman's prospects. This requirement underscores the biblical emphasis on justice and restitution, as seen in other laws in <a href="/exodus/21.htm">Exodus 21-22</a>. It also highlights the protection of women's rights and dignity within the legal framework of ancient Israel. The concept of restitution is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to make amends for wrongs, as seen in Zacchaeus' story in <a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/father.htm">Father</a></b><br>The patriarchal figure in the family who holds authority over his daughter's marriage decisions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter.htm">Daughter</a></b><br>The young woman whose marriage is being negotiated, reflecting the cultural norms of ancient Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/suitor.htm">Suitor</a></b><br>The man seeking to marry the daughter, who must respect the father's decision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bride_price.htm">Bride Price</a></b><br>A customary payment made by the suitor to the bride's family, symbolizing commitment and responsibility.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical context in which these laws were given, reflecting societal norms and values.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_and_responsibility.htm">Authority and Responsibility</a></b><br>The father's role in this passage highlights the importance of parental guidance and authority in marriage decisions, reflecting a protective and responsible approach to family leadership.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_family_structure.htm">Respect for Family Structure</a></b><br>The suitor's obligation to pay the bride price even if the marriage does not occur underscores the respect for family structures and the seriousness of marriage intentions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_context_and_modern_application.htm">Cultural Context and Modern Application</a></b><br>While the cultural practices of ancient Israel differ from today, the underlying principles of respect, responsibility, and family involvement in marriage decisions remain relevant.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/valuing_women.htm">Valuing Women</a></b><br>The bride price signifies the value and respect accorded to women, challenging us to uphold the dignity and worth of women in all societal interactions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_and_integrity.htm">Commitment and Integrity</a></b><br>The requirement for the suitor to fulfill his financial obligation even if the marriage is refused teaches the importance of integrity and commitment in relationships.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_22_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 22:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_17_God_s_holiness_standard.htm">How does Exodus 22:17 reflect God's standards for holiness and community purity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Ignoring_Exodus_22_17_consequences.htm">What are the consequences of ignoring God's commands in Exodus 22:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_17_s_link_to_NT_purity.htm">How does Exodus 22:17 connect with New Testament teachings on purity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Exodus_22_17_today.htm">How can we apply the principles of Exodus 22:17 in today's society?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_17_God_s_justice_and_mercy.htm">What does Exodus 22:17 teach about God's justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_17_s_insight_on_ancient_Israel.htm">What does Exodus 22:17 reveal about the cultural context of ancient Israelite society?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_17_s_role_in_biblical_justice.htm">How does Exodus 22:17 align with the overall message of justice in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Exodus_22_17_significant.htm">Why is the command in Exodus 22:17 significant in understanding biblical law?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_22.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_premarital_sex_like_marriage.htm">Is premarital sex equivalent to marriage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/exodus_22_16-17__consent_vs._autonomy.htm">Exodus 22:16&#8211;17: How does requiring the seducer to marry or pay for the virgin align with modern concepts of consent and women&#8217;s autonomy?
