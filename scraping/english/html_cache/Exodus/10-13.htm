It was used in previous plagues and miracles, such as turning the Nile into blood (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>) and parting the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16</a>). The act of stretching out the staff signifies Moses acting as God's representative, executing divine judgment. The land of Egypt, a powerful and influential nation, is being humbled by God's might, demonstrating His supremacy over all earthly powers.<p><b>and throughout that day and night the LORD sent an east wind across the land</b><br>The east wind is often associated with judgment and destruction in the Bible. In <a href="/genesis/41-6.htm">Genesis 41:6</a>, an east wind scorches the grain in Pharaoh's dream, symbolizing famine. Here, the east wind is a divine instrument used to bring about the plague of locusts. The continuous blowing of the wind day and night emphasizes the certainty and thoroughness of God's judgment. It also highlights God's control over nature, as He uses natural elements to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>By morning the east wind had brought the locusts</b><br>Locusts are a symbol of devastation and are often used in Scripture to depict overwhelming destruction (<a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>). The arrival of the locusts by morning signifies the suddenness and completeness of the plague. This event fulfills God's warning to Pharaoh and serves as a direct challenge to the Egyptian gods, who were believed to protect the land and crops. The locusts' arrival also prefigures the finality of God's judgment, as seen in <a href="/revelation/9-3.htm">Revelation 9:3</a>, where locusts are part of the end-times plagues. This plague foreshadows the ultimate deliverance of God's people, as it leads to the eventual release of the Israelites from bondage, a type of Christ's deliverance of humanity from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egyptian bondage.
