The demand to "let My people go" is a recurring theme in the narrative of the Exodus, emphasizing God's desire for the liberation of the Israelites from slavery. This reflects God's covenantal promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to make their descendants a great nation. The phrase also highlights the concept of divine authority and the consequences of disobedience to God's commands.<p><b>I will send swarms of flies upon you</b><br>The sending of swarms of flies is the fourth plague that God inflicts upon Egypt. This plague demonstrates God's power over nature and His ability to disrupt the daily life of the Egyptians. The Hebrew term used here can refer to various types of insects, possibly including biting flies or other pests. This plague serves as a direct challenge to the Egyptian gods, who were believed to protect the land and its people from such calamities.<p><b>and your officials and your people and your houses</b><br>The inclusion of officials, people, and houses indicates the widespread impact of the plague. It affects all levels of Egyptian society, from the highest officials to the common people, demonstrating that no one is exempt from God's judgment. This also underscores the communal nature of sin and its consequences, as the entire nation suffers due to Pharaoh's hardened heart.<p><b>The houses of the Egyptians and even the ground where they stand will be full of flies</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the severity and pervasiveness of the plague. The infestation of flies not only invades personal spaces but also covers the ground, making it impossible to escape the nuisance and discomfort. This imagery of overwhelming infestation serves as a metaphor for the inescapable nature of divine judgment. It also foreshadows the totality of God's deliverance for the Israelites, contrasting the oppression they faced in Egypt with the freedom they would experience in the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.
