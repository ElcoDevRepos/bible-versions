These individuals were considered experts in interpreting dreams, performing rituals, and wielding magical powers. The presence of such figures in Pharaoh's court underscores the cultural and religious context of ancient Egypt, where magic was intertwined with daily life and governance. This reliance on human wisdom and sorcery contrasts with the divine power of God, setting the stage for the confrontation between God's authority and human attempts to replicate it.<p><b>and magicians of Egypt</b><br>The magicians of Egypt were part of a class of priests who were skilled in the occult and practiced various forms of magic. Their role was significant in maintaining the religious and cultural traditions of Egypt. Historically, Egyptian magicians were known for their ability to perform illusions and manipulate perceptions, which they used to maintain their influence and authority. This phrase highlights the spiritual battle between the God of Israel and the gods of Egypt, as represented by these magicians.<p><b>and they also did the same things by their magic arts</b><br>The magicians' ability to replicate the miracles performed by Moses and Aaron suggests that they possessed some level of supernatural power, though it was limited and ultimately inferior to God's power. This phrase illustrates the theme of counterfeit miracles, where human or demonic forces attempt to mimic divine acts. It serves as a reminder of the spiritual deception that can occur when people rely on magic and sorcery instead of seeking the true power of God. This event foreshadows the eventual triumph of God's power over the false gods of Egypt, as seen in the subsequent plagues and the Exodus narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who is resistant to God's command to let the Israelites go.

Magic was very widely practised in Egypt, and consisted mainly in the composition and employment of charms, which were believed to exert a powerful effect, both over man and over the brute creation. A large part of the "Ritual of the Dead" consists of charms, which <span class= "ital">were</span> to be uttered by the soul in Hades, in order to enable it to pass the various monsters which it would encounter there. Charms were also regarded as potent in this life to produce or remove disease, and avert the attacks of noxious animals. Some Egyptian works are mere collections of magical receipts, and supply strange prescriptions which are to be used, and mystic words which are to be uttered. A Jewish tradition, accepted by the Apostle Paul (<a href="/2_timothy/3-6.htm" title="For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,">2Timothy 3:6</a>), spoke of two magicians as the special opponents of Moses, and called them "Jannes and Jambres." (See the Tar-gums of Jerusalem and of Jonathan, and comp. Numen, <span class= "ital">ap. </span>Euseb. <span class= "ital">Pr?p. e<span class= "greekheb"></span>.</span> ix. 8.) The former of these, Jannes, obtained fame as a magician among the classical writers, and is mentioned by Pliny (<span class= "ital">H. N.</span> xxx. 1) and Apuleius (<span class= "ital">Apolog.</span> p. 108). It has been supposed by some that the magicians were really in possession of supernatural powers, obtained by a connection with evil spirits; but, on the whole, it is perhaps most probable that they were merely persons acquainted with many secrets of nature not generally known, and trained in tricks of sleight-of-hand and conjuring.<p><span class= "bld">They also did in like manner.</span>--The magicians had entered into the royal presence with, apparently, rods in their hands, such as almost all Egyptians carried. These they cast down upon the ground, when they were seen to be serpents. This was, perhaps, the mere exhibition of a trick, well known to Egyptian serpent-charmers in all ages (<span class= "ital">Description de l'Egypte,</span> vol. i. p. 159), by which a charmed serpent is made to look like a stick for a time, and then disenchanted. Or it may have been effected by sleight-of-hand, which seems to be the true meaning of the word <span class= "ital">l?hatim,</span> translated "enchantments." (Rosenmller, <span class= "ital">Scholia in Exodum,</span> p. 110.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers</span>. That magic was an object of much attention and study in Egypt is abundantly evident from "The tale of Setnau" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 4. pp. 133-148), "The Magic Papyrus" (ibid. vol. 10. pp. 137-158), and many other writings. It consisted, to a large extent, in charms, which were thought to have power over men and beasts, especially over reptiles. What amount of skill and power the Egyptian magicians possessed may perhaps be doubted. Many commentators believe them to have been in actual communication With the unseen world, and to have worked their wonders by the assistance of evil spirits. Others, who reject this explanation, believe that they themselves were in possession of certain supernatural gifts. But the commonest view at the present day regards them as simply persons who had a knowledge of many secrets of nature which were generally unknown, and who used this knowledge to impress men with a belief in their supernatural power. The words used to express "magicians" and "enchantments" support this view. The magicians are called <span class="accented">khakamim</span>, "wise men," "men educated in human and divine wisdom" (Keil and Delitzsch); <span class="accented">mekashshephim</span>, "charmers," "mutterers of magic words" (Gesenius); and <span class="accented">khartummim</span>, which is thought to mean either "sacred scribes" or "bearers of sacred words" (Cook). The word translated "enchantments" is <span class="accented">lehatim</span>, which means "secret" or "hidden arts" (Gesenius). On the whole, we regard it as most probable that the Egyptian "magicians" of this time were jugglers of a high class, well skilled in serpent-charming and other kindred arts, but not possessed of any supernatural powers. <span class="cmt_word">The magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments</span>. The magicians, aware of the wonder which would probably be wrought, had prepared themselves; they had brought serpents, charmed and stiffened so as to look like rods (a common trick in Egypt: 'Description de l'Egypte,' vol. 1. p. 159) in their hands; and when Aaron's rod became a serpent, they threw their stiffened snakes upon the ground, and disenchanted them, so that they were seen to be what they were - shakos, and not really rods. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/7-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Pharaoh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">called</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
