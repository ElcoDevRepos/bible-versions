In the biblical context, the number three often signifies completeness or divine perfection, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus on the third day (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>). This preparation involved consecration, which included washing clothes and abstaining from certain activities, symbolizing purity and holiness (<a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10</a>). The concept of preparation is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be ready for the return of Christ (<a href="/matthew/24-44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>).<p><b>for on the third day</b><br>The repetition of "the third day" underscores its significance. It marks a divinely appointed time for God&#8217;s revelation. This timing is a precursor to the New Testament fulfillment of God's promises, such as the resurrection of Christ, which also occurred on the third day, signifying victory over sin and death (<a href="/luke/24-7.htm">Luke 24:7</a>). The third day in biblical narratives often marks a turning point or a moment of divine intervention.<p><b>the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai</b><br>Mount Sinai is a significant geographical location in the biblical narrative, traditionally identified with Jebel Musa in the Sinai Peninsula. It is the mountain where Moses first encountered God in the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3:1-2</a>) and where the Ten Commandments were given. The phrase "the LORD will come down" indicates a theophany, a visible manifestation of God to humans. This event foreshadows the incarnation of Christ, where God came down to dwell among humanity (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The descent of the LORD signifies His willingness to engage with His people and establish a covenant relationship.<p><b>in the sight of all the people</b><br>This phrase highlights the communal aspect of the revelation at Sinai. Unlike previous encounters with God that were more private, this event was witnessed by the entire nation of Israel, emphasizing the collective responsibility and covenant relationship between God and His people. It serves as a reminder of the visible and public nature of God's acts, paralleling the public ministry and crucifixion of Jesus, witnessed by many (<a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22-24</a>). The visibility of God's presence at Sinai underscores His desire for His people to know Him and His laws, setting the stage for the establishment of Israel as a nation under God&#8217;s rule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is preparing to reveal Himself to His people in a significant and awe-inspiring way.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who acts as the mediator between God and the people, conveying God's instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being prepared to witness a divine revelation and receive the Law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The holy mountain where God will descend to meet with Moses and give the Law to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_third_day.htm">The Third Day</a></b><br>A specific time set by God for His revelation, emphasizing preparation and anticipation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_divine_encounter.htm">Preparation for Divine Encounter</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were instructed to prepare for God's presence, believers today are called to prepare their hearts and lives for encounters with God through prayer, worship, and holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god.htm">The Holiness of God</a></b><br>God's descent on Mount Sinai underscores His holiness and the reverence due to Him.
