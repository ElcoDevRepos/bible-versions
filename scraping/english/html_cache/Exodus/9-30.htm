In the context of the plagues, it underscores the stubbornness and hard-heartedness of not just Pharaoh but also his advisors. Historically, Egyptian officials were deeply entrenched in the polytheistic culture, which made the acknowledgment of the God of Israel particularly challenging. This collective mention emphasizes the widespread resistance to God's commands.<p><b>I know that you still do not fear</b><br>The phrase "I know" indicates God's omniscience and Moses' understanding of Pharaoh's heart, which remains hardened despite the miraculous signs. The concept of "fear" in biblical terms often refers to reverence and awe, which Pharaoh and his officials lack. This lack of fear is a recurring theme in the narrative of the plagues, illustrating the spiritual blindness and pride of the Egyptian leadership. Theologically, it contrasts with the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>the LORD our God.</b><br>This phrase identifies the God of Israel as distinct from the gods of Egypt, emphasizing His sovereignty and power. The use of "our God" signifies a personal relationship between the Israelites and Yahweh, contrasting with the impersonal nature of Egyptian deities. Theologically, this distinction is crucial as it sets the stage for the eventual deliverance of Israel and the establishment of a covenant relationship. The plagues serve as a demonstration of God's supremacy over all false gods, a theme that resonates throughout the Old Testament and is fulfilled in the New Testament through Christ's victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.
