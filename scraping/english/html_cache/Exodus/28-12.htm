The shoulder pieces were integral to the ephod's design, symbolizing the priest's role in bearing the people before God. The fastening of stones on these shoulder pieces signifies the importance of the tribes of Israel, as each stone represented six of the twelve tribes. This act of fastening indicates permanence and the enduring covenant between God and His people.<p><b>as memorial stones for the sons of Israel</b><br>The stones served as a memorial, a physical reminder of the twelve tribes of Israel. In biblical times, memorials were often used to commemorate significant events or covenants (e.g., <a href="/joshua/4-7.htm">Joshua 4:7</a>). These stones ensured that the high priest carried the memory and representation of the entire nation before God. The use of stones as memorials is consistent with other biblical practices, such as the stones set up by Jacob in <a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>.<p><b>Aaron is to bear their names on his two shoulders</b><br>Aaron, as the high priest, had the unique responsibility of representing the people before God. Bearing the names on his shoulders symbolizes the weight of this responsibility and the intercessory role of the priesthood. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ is seen as the ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>), bearing the sins and burdens of humanity.<p><b>as a memorial before the LORD</b><br>The concept of a memorial before the LORD emphasizes the perpetual remembrance of the tribes in the divine presence. This act of remembrance is not just for the people but is also a reminder to God of His promises and covenant with Israel. The idea of being "before the LORD" signifies a position of honor and continual presence, reflecting the ongoing relationship between God and His chosen people. This foreshadows the eternal intercession of Christ, who is always before the Father on behalf of believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
