This act of obedience to God's command demonstrates their faith and courage, as Pharaoh was the most powerful ruler of the time. The setting is likely in one of the royal palaces in Egypt, a place of immense power and authority. This encounter is the beginning of a series of confrontations between God's representatives and the Egyptian king, highlighting the theme of divine authority versus human authority.<p><b>and did just as the LORD had commanded.</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's instructions. Moses and Aaron's actions are in direct response to God's earlier command in <a href="/exodus/7-9.htm">Exodus 7:9</a>. Their obedience is a model for faithfulness, showing that God's plans are fulfilled through human cooperation. This obedience is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, emphasizing that God's purposes are often accomplished through those who follow His commands.<p><b>Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his officials,</b><br>The act of throwing down the staff is symbolic and significant. In ancient Egypt, the staff was a symbol of authority and power. By throwing it down, Aaron is demonstrating the power of God over the Egyptian gods and Pharaoh's authority. This act is performed in the presence of Pharaoh's officials, indicating a public demonstration meant to challenge the Egyptian belief system and assert the supremacy of the God of Israel.<p><b>and it became a serpent.</b><br>The transformation of the staff into a serpent is a miraculous sign intended to demonstrate God's power. In Egyptian culture, serpents were associated with both danger and protection, often symbolizing the power of the Pharaoh himself. This miracle prefigures the plagues that will follow, each designed to challenge the gods of Egypt. The serpent can also be seen as a type of Christ, who would later defeat the serpent, Satan, as prophesied in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>. This act foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's power over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

The episode assures believers that when God sends and we obey, His authority over every earthly power is never in doubt.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-13.</span> - THE FIRST SIGN, AND ITS FAILURE TO CONVINCE. Obeying the command given them (vers. 2, 9), Moses and Aaron went to the court a second time, and entering into the royal presence, probably repeated their demand - as from God - that the king would let the Children of Israel go (<a href="/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11</a>), when Pharaoh objected that they had no authority to speak to him in God's name, and required an evidence of their authority, either in the actual words of verse 9 ("Shew a miracle for you"), or in some equivalent ones. Aaron hereupon cast down on the ground the rod which Moses had brought from Midian, and it became a serpent (ver. 10). Possibly Pharaoh may have been prepared for this. He may have been told that this was one among the signs which had been done in the sight of the elders and people of Israel when the two brothers first came back from Midian (<a href="/exodus/4-30.htm">Exodus 4:30</a>). If he knew of it, no doubt the "magicians" knew of it, and had prepared themselves. Pharaoh summoned them, as was natural, to his presence, and consulted them with respect to the portent, whereupon they too cast down the rods which they were carrying in their hands, and they "became serpents; but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods" (ver. 12). (For the explanation of those facts, see the comment below). Pharaoh was to some extent impressed by the miracle, but not so as to yield. His heart remained hard, and he refused to let the people go. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Aaron cast down his rod</span>. The rod is called indifferently "Aaron's rod" and "Moses' rod," because, though properly the rod of Moses (<a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2</a>), yet ordinarily it was placed in the hands of Aaron (vers. 19, 20; <a href="/exodus/8-5.htm">Exodus 8:5, 17</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">It became a serpent</span>. The word for "serpent" is not the same as was used before (<a href="/exodus/4-3.htm">Exodus 4:3</a>); but it is not clear that a different species is meant.
