The summoning "by night" suggests a sense of desperation and fear, as nighttime was typically a period of rest. This action contrasts with Pharaoh's previous refusals and hard-heartedness, highlighting a significant turning point. The urgency also reflects the fulfillment of God's warning to Pharaoh through Moses and Aaron, demonstrating God's sovereignty and the power of His judgments.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Get up, leave my people, both you and the Israelites!</b><br>Pharaoh's command to "get up" and "leave" signifies a complete reversal of his previous stance. The phrase "my people" indicates Pharaoh's acknowledgment of the Israelites' distinct identity, separate from the Egyptians. This separation fulfills God's promise to make a distinction between His people and Egypt (<a href="/exodus/8-22.htm">Exodus 8:22-23</a>). The inclusion of "both you and the Israelites" emphasizes the collective liberation of the entire nation, not just Moses and Aaron, aligning with God's covenant promise to Abraham about his descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>).<p><b>Go, worship the LORD as you have requested.</b><br>Pharaoh's permission for the Israelites to "go, worship the LORD" marks the culmination of Moses' repeated requests to let the people go to serve God (<a href="/exodus/5.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>). This phrase underscores the primary purpose of the Exodus: to worship and serve Yahweh. It highlights the centrality of worship in the Israelites' identity and mission. The phrase "as you have requested" indicates Pharaoh's reluctant compliance with God's demand, showcasing God's ultimate authority over earthly rulers. This moment foreshadows the future worship of God in the Promised Land and points to the ultimate deliverance and worship through Jesus Christ, who liberates believers from the bondage of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who initially refused to let the Israelites go, but after the tenth plague, he relents and commands Moses and Aaron to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

(See above, <a href="/exodus/11-8.htm" title="And all these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Get you out, and all the people that follow you: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.">Exodus 11:8</a>.) The messengers were undoubtedly chief officials; they "bowed themselves down" before Moses, who was now recognised as "very great" (<a href="/exodus/11-3.htm" title="And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.">Exodus 11:3</a>), and delivered their master's message, which granted in express terms all that Moses had ever demanded. Pharaoh's spirit was, for the time, thoroughly broken.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-36.</span> - THE DISMISSAL The first action seems to have been taken by Pharaoh. The "cry" of the people had no doubt been heard in the palace, and he was aware that the blow had not fallen on himself alone, and may have anticipated what the people's feelings would be; but he did not wait for any direct pressure to be put upon him before yielding. He sent his chief officers (<a href="/exodus/11-8.htm">Exodus 11:8</a>) while it was still night (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31</a>), to inform Moses and Aaron, not only that they might, but that they must take their departure immediately, with all the people, and added that they might take with them their flocks and herds. The surrender was thus complete; and it was accompanied by a request which we should scarcely have expected. Pharaoh craved at the hands of the two brothers a blessing! We are not told how his request was received; but that it should have been made is a striking indication of how his pride was humbled. The overture from Pharaoh was followed rapidly by a popular movement, which was universal and irresistible. The Egyptians "rose up" everywhere, and "were urgent upon the people," to "send them out of the land in haste" (ver. 33); and to expedite their departure readily supplied them at their request with gold and silver and raiment (ver. 35), thus voluntarily spoiling themselves for the benefit of the foreigners. The Israelites, long previously prepared for the moment which had now arrived, made their final arrangements, and before the day was over a lengthy column was set in motion, and proceeded from Rameses, which seems to have been a suburb of Tunis (Brugsch, <span class="accented">Hist</span>. <span class="accented">of Egypt</span>, vol. 2. pp. 96-99), to an unknown place called Succoth, which must have lain towards the south-east, and was probably not very remote from the capital <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he called for Moses and Aaron</span>. Kalisch understands this as a summons to the King's presence (Commentary, p. 130), and even supposes that the two brothers complied, notwithstanding what Moses had said (<a href="/exodus/10-29.htm">Exodus 10:29</a>). But perhaps no more is meant than at Pharaoh's instance Moses and Aaron were summoned to an interview with some of the Court officials (see <a href="/exodus/11-8.htm">Exodus 11:8</a>). As ye have said. Literally, "according to your words."
