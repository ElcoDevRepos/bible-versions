In ancient Israelite society, women often engaged in textile work, a vital part of daily life and religious practice. The term "skilled" indicates that these women were not only experienced but also gifted in their craft, suggesting a divine endowment of ability similar to Bezalel and Oholiab (<a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a>).<p><b>spun with her hands</b><br>Spinning was a common domestic task in ancient cultures, requiring dexterity and patience. The act of spinning with their hands signifies personal involvement and dedication. This manual labor reflects the broader biblical theme of working with one's hands as a form of worship and service to God (<a href="/proverbs/31-13.htm">Proverbs 31:13, 19</a>).<p><b>and brought what she had spun</b><br>The women not only created the materials but also willingly offered them for the Tabernacle. This act of bringing their work symbolizes a heart of generosity and willingness to contribute to God's dwelling place. It parallels the New Testament teaching of giving joyfully and sacrificially (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<p><b>blue, purple, or scarlet yarn</b><br>These colors were significant in ancient Israelite worship, often associated with royalty, wealth, and divinity. Blue symbolized the heavens and divine revelation, purple was a color of royalty and nobility, and scarlet represented sacrifice and atonement. These colors were used in the Tabernacle's curtains and priestly garments, pointing to the majesty and holiness of God (<a href="/exodus/26.htm">Exodus 26:1, 28</a>:5-6).<p><b>or fine linen</b><br>Fine linen was a luxury item in the ancient Near East, known for its quality and purity. It was used in the Tabernacle and priestly garments, symbolizing righteousness and holiness. Linen's association with purity is echoed in <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>, where the bride of Christ is clothed in fine linen, representing the righteous acts of the saints.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/skilled_women.htm">Skilled Women</a></b><br>These are the women of Israel who possessed the skill and craftsmanship to spin yarn and linen.
