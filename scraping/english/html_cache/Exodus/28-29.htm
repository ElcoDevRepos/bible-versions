The Holy Place was part of the Tabernacle, a sacred space where God's presence dwelled among the Israelites. This highlights the unique role of the high priest as a mediator between God and the people, foreshadowing the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ, our High Priest, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>.<p><b>he shall bear the names of the sons of Israel</b><br>The names of the twelve tribes of Israel were engraved on stones set in the breastpiece, symbolizing the high priest's representation of all the people before God.

This reflects the heart of Christ, who carries His people with compassion and justice.<p><b>as a continual reminder before the LORD</b><br>This continual reminder underscores the perpetual nature of the priestly intercession. The high priest's role was not a one-time event but an ongoing duty, symbolizing the eternal intercession of Christ for believers.

The high priest was to be wholly identified with the people; to be one with them in affection no less than in action; to bear their names on his shoulders, as supporting them and wrestling for them, while he also bore their names on his heart, as loving them and feeling for them. Thus he was continually to present before God a two-fold "memorial" of His people, and to make a sort of double appeal, on the one hand, to God's power, and, on the other hand, to His mercy and loving-kindness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Aaron shall bear</span>, etc. "Aaron," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "shall not only bear the names of the twelve tribes upon his shoulders (ver. 12), but also upon his heart." He shall thus make a double presentation of them to God continually. The explanation is somewhat fanciful, that the names on the shoulder-stones indicated that the people were a burthen to him, while those on the stones of the breast-plate, being upon his breast, indicated that he bore them affection. The breast and the shoulder were probably chosen as being conspicuous and honourable positions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/28-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Whenever [Aaron] enters</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
