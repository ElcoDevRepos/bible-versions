In ancient Near Eastern cultures, physical signs or marks were often used to signify allegiance or identity. The hand represents action and work, suggesting that the Israelites' daily activities should reflect their covenant with God. This concept is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>, where binding God's commandments on the hand symbolizes living out His laws in everyday life.<p><b>and a reminder on your forehead</b><br>The forehead symbolizes thought and consciousness. In biblical times, the forehead was considered the seat of one's identity and character. This phrase suggests that the Israelites should constantly keep God's laws in their minds. <a href="/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14:1</a> references the name of God written on the foreheads of the faithful, indicating ownership and dedication to God. The practice of wearing phylacteries, small boxes containing scripture, by some Jewish communities is a literal interpretation of this command.<p><b>that the Law of the LORD is to be on your lips</b><br>This emphasizes the importance of verbal proclamation and teaching of God's laws. The lips represent speech, and this phrase underscores the necessity of speaking and sharing God's commandments. <a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a> highlights the importance of meditating on the law day and night, ensuring it is always spoken and remembered. This practice helps to internalize God's word, making it a guiding principle in life.<p><b>For with a mighty hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt</b><br>This phrase recalls the powerful and miraculous acts God performed to deliver the Israelites from slavery. The "mighty hand" signifies God's strength and intervention in human history. The Exodus is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing salvation and redemption. It prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who, by His death and resurrection, brings believers out of the bondage of sin. This deliverance is celebrated annually in the Passover, a lasting ordinance for the Jewish people, and is also reflected in the Christian understanding of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

These phylacteries consist of small strips of parchment, on which are written certain passages from the Law--viz., <a href="/context/exodus/13-2.htm" title="Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.">Exodus 13:2-10</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/6-4.htm" title="Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>, and <a href="/context/deuteronomy/11-13.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,">Deuteronomy 11:13-21</a>--and which are then folded tight, placed in small boxes, and attached by bands to the left wrist and the forehead at the hours of prayer. It is well known that a similar custom prevailed in Egypt (Wilkinson, <span class= "ital">Ancient Egyptians,</span> <a href="/deuteronomy/11-18.htm" title="Therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign on your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.">Deuteronomy 11:18</a>). [Dean Plumptre notices, in his <span class= "ital">Commentary on the Temptation</span> (St. Matt.), that our Blessed Lord used against the adversary quotations from the Scriptures forming these very Tephillin.] . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes</span>. There can be no doubt that the Jewish system of <span class="accented">tephillin</span>, or "phylacteries," grew mainly out of this passage, and was intended as a fulfilment of the commands contained in it. <span class="accented">The tephillin</span> were strips of parchment with passages of Scripture written upon them and deposited in small boxes, which were fastened by a strap either to the left arm, or across the forehead. The modern Jews argue that they were what Moses here intended, and that their employment began from this time. Some Christian commentators agree with them. But the great majority argue, from supposed probability and from the entire absence of any reference to the actual wearing of <span class="accented">tephillin</span> in the Old Testament, that the custom must be, comparatively speaking, a modern one. It is generally supposed to have originated, with other superstitious practices, in the time of the Babylonish captivity. Those who take this view regard the words of Moses in the present passage as merely metaphorical, and compare them with <a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-21.htm">Proverbs 6:21</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-3.htm">Proverbs 7:3</a>. Kalisch, however, observes with reason, that if the injunction to write passages of the Law on the door-posts of their houses (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-9.htm">Deuteronomy 6:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-20.htm">Deuteronomy 11:20</a>) was intended to be understood literally, and was literally carried out (<a href="/isaiah/57-8.htm">Isaiah 57:8</a>), the commands with respect to <span class="accented">tephillin</span>, which <span class="accented">are coupled with them</span> (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18</a>) must have been similarly intended. And probability, which is said to be against the Mosaic origin of <span class="accented">tephillin</span>, may perhaps rather be urged in its favour. The Egyptian practice Of wearing as amulets "forms of words written on folds of papyrus tightly rolled up and sewn in linen" (Wilkinson's <span class="accented">Ancient Egyptians</span>, vol. 3. p. 364) is well attested. Would it not be in harmony with the general character of his legislation, that Moses should adopt and regulate the custom, employing it to do honour to the Law and keep it in remembrance, without perhaps purging it wholly from superstitious ideas? Moses allowed the Israelites in many things "for the hardness of their hearts," content if he could introduce some improvement without insisting at once on an impracticable perfection. <span class="cmt_word">That the law of the Lord may be in thy month</span>. The Israelites are instructed from the first, that the <span class="accented">tephillin are</span> to be a means to an end; and that the end is to be the retention of God's law in their recollection - " in their mouth," and therefore in their heart, since "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/13-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">It shall be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
