This reflects the intimate relationship Moses has with God, as seen throughout the Exodus narrative. The use of "Lord" signifies a recognition of God's sovereignty and power, a common theme in the Old Testament where God is often addressed with titles that denote His majesty and authority.<p><b>&#8220;if I have indeed found favor in Your sight, my Lord,</b><br>Moses appeals to the favor he has found with God, a recurring theme in his intercessory role for Israel. This favor is not based on Moses' merit but on God's grace. The phrase echoes earlier instances where Moses intercedes for the people, such as in <a href="/exodus/33-12.htm">Exodus 33:12-17</a>, highlighting the importance of divine favor in the covenant relationship.<p><b>please go with us.</b><br>Moses requests God's presence to accompany Israel, emphasizing the necessity of divine guidance and protection. This plea is rooted in the understanding that Israel's identity and success are contingent upon God's presence, as seen in <a href="/exodus/33-15.htm">Exodus 33:15-16</a>. The request underscores the covenantal promise of God dwelling among His people, a theme that foreshadows the incarnation of Christ, "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<p><b>Although this is a stiff-necked people,</b><br>Moses acknowledges the rebellious nature of the Israelites, a term used frequently in the Pentateuch to describe their obstinacy (<a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>). This confession is crucial for understanding the need for divine mercy and patience. The term "stiff-necked" illustrates the people's resistance to God's will, a condition that necessitates repentance and divine intervention.<p><b>forgive our iniquity and sin,</b><br>Moses intercedes for the forgiveness of the people's transgressions, recognizing the gravity of their sin. This plea for forgiveness is central to the covenant relationship, where God's mercy is sought to restore fellowship. The dual mention of "iniquity and sin" underscores the comprehensive nature of their wrongdoing, reflecting the need for atonement, which is ultimately fulfilled in Christ's sacrificial death (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><b>and take us as Your inheritance.&#8221;</b><br>Moses asks God to claim Israel as His own possession, a concept rooted in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7-8</a>). This request highlights the special relationship between God and Israel, where the people are seen as God's treasured possession (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The idea of inheritance also points forward to the New Testament, where believers are described as co-heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>), emphasizing the continuity of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who intercedes on behalf of the people, asking for God's presence and forgiveness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is being petitioned by Moses for mercy and continued guidance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>Referred to as a "stiff-necked people," indicating their stubbornness and frequent disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The location where Moses receives the Ten Commandments and where this plea is made.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant_renewal.htm">The Covenant Renewal</a></b><br>This event is part of the renewal of the covenant between God and Israel after the incident of the golden calf.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/intercession_and_leadership.htm">Intercession and Leadership</a></b><br>Moses exemplifies the role of a leader who intercedes for his people.

It is the name that moments earlier echoed through the mountain as God proclaimed, &#8220;The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>).<p>- By repeating that name back, Moses affirms what <a href="/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a> says: &#8220;Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations.&#8221; The conversation is personal, not theoretical.<p>- The pattern is the same throughout Scripture&#8212;those who know God best begin with adoration (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If I have indeed found favor in Your sight, my Lord</b><p>- Moses leans on grace already given. In <a href="/exodus/33-17.htm">Exodus 33:17</a> the LORD told him, &#8220;You have found favor in My sight.&#8221; He now brings that promise back to God.<p>- Others used the same language:<p>&#8226; Noah&#8212;&#8220;But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Mary&#8212;&#8220;You have found favor with God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>).<p>- Each instance shows that favor is God&#8217;s unearned kindness; Moses appeals to that, not his merit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Please go with us</b><p>- After the golden-calf disaster, God had offered to send an angel instead of His own presence (<a href="/exodus/33-2.htm">Exodus 33:2-3</a>). Moses says that is not enough.<p>- He remembers the promise, &#8220;My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>).<p>- Scripture keeps pressing this truth:<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>&#8212;&#8220;Rise up, O LORD! May Your enemies be scattered.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>&#8212;&#8220;He will never leave you nor forsake you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>&#8212;&#8220;I am with you always.&#8221;<p>- The literal, physical nearness of God is essential to covenant life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Although this is a stiff-necked people</b><p>- Moses states the problem plainly. God had used the same words: &#8220;I have seen this people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>).<p>- Confession means agreeing with God. <a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a> echoes it generations later: &#8220;You stiff-necked people&#8230;you always resist the Holy Spirit.&#8221;<p>- Moses does not minimize sin; he names it, owns it, and brings it into the light.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Forgive our iniquity and sin</b><p>- The cry moves from description to petition. Earlier he prayed, &#8220;But now, please forgive their sin&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>). He prays it again because forgiveness is not a one-time need.<p>- <a href="/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1-2</a> celebrates the answer: &#8220;Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a> confirms the pattern for every generation: &#8220;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us.&#8221;<p>- Moses believes God literally removes guilt; the cross will ultimately fulfill that promise (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And take us as Your inheritance</b><p>- More than rescue, Moses asks for belonging. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a> says the LORD &#8220;brought you out of the iron furnace&#8230;to be His people and His inheritance.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a> shows the same heartbeat in Christ: He &#8220;gave Himself for us&#8230;to purify for Himself a people of His own.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a> celebrates the outcome: &#8220;a chosen people, a royal priesthood&#8230; God&#8217;s special possession.&#8221;<p>- To be God&#8217;s inheritance means secured, valued, and purposed&#8212;nothing less than covenant adoption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/34-9.htm">Exodus 34:9</a> is Moses&#8217; six-fold plea that knits adoration, grace, presence, confession, forgiveness, and belonging into one moment.

The verse captures the entire gospel pattern: God&#8217;s gracious initiative, honest repentance, and restoring fellowship that makes a people His inheritance forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>THE COVENANT RENEWED, AND THE DECALOGUE A SECOND TIME GIVEN.</span><p>(9) <span class= "bld">If now, I have found grace in thy sight.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Since now, &c. </span>The evidences of God's favour towards him--which Moses had now experienced, emboldened him to prefer fresh requests on behalf of the people. God has promised to go up in the midst of them; will He not also promise to forgive their iniquity and sin if they offend Him in the way, and permanently to attach them to Himself by making them "His inheritance?" God does not directly answer these prayers, but indirectly accepts them by renewing His covenant with Israel (<a href="/exodus/34-10.htm" title="And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which you are shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with you.">Exodus 34:10</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-27.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Write you these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.">Exodus 34:27</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-26.</span> - THE RENEWAL OF THE COVENANT. Dazed, as it would seem, by the splendour of the vision which he had beheld, Moses forgot that God had already pledged himself to renew the covenant, and lead the people in person to Canaan. In his forgetfulness, he once more set himself to intercede with God on their behalf, and besought him - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That he would go up with them; <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he would pardon them; and <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That he would once more take them as his inheritance (ver. 9). Without replying separately to these requests, God formally renews the covenant; promises not only to go up with the people, but to work miracles for them (ver. 10), and to drive out the nations before them when they have arrived (ver. 11); and makes a brief summary of the chief points of positive observance, which he requires of them in addition to the moral law.
