It was constructed of acacia wood and overlaid with bronze, signifying strength and endurance. This altar prefigures Christ's ultimate sacrifice on the cross, where He offered Himself as the perfect and final atonement for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). The altar's location at the entrance of the tabernacle signifies the necessity of atonement before entering into God's presence.<p><b>with all its utensils</b><br>The utensils associated with the altar included firepans, shovels, basins, forks, and firepans, each crafted for specific functions in the sacrificial process (<a href="/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>). These tools were essential for handling the offerings and maintaining the altar's fire, symbolizing the meticulous care required in worship and service to God. The detailed instructions for these utensils underscore the importance of order and reverence in approaching God, reflecting the holiness and precision of divine worship.<p><b>and the basin</b><br>The basin, or laver, was made of bronze and placed between the tent of meeting and the altar (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>). It was used by the priests for ceremonial washing before they entered the tent or approached the altar, symbolizing purification and the need for cleanliness before serving God. This act of washing prefigures the cleansing from sin that believers receive through Christ (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>), emphasizing the necessity of spiritual purity in the life of a believer.<p><b>with its stand&#8212;</b><br>The stand for the basin ensured its stability and accessibility, highlighting the importance of readiness and preparation in worship. The stand's presence indicates that the basin was not merely a functional item but a significant part of the tabernacle's design, reinforcing the theme of holiness and the structured approach to worship. This preparation and stability can be seen as a type of the believer's steadfastness in faith, grounded in the truth of God's Word (<a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the tabernacle and its furnishings from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled artisans appointed by God to construct the tabernacle and its furnishings, including the altar of burnt offering and the basin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_of_burnt_offering.htm">The Altar of Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A key component of the tabernacle where sacrifices were made to atone for the sins of the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_basin.htm">The Basin</a></b><br>Used by the priests for ceremonial washing, symbolizing purification before entering the presence of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>God provided specific instructions for the construction of the tabernacle and its furnishings.
