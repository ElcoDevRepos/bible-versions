The timing, "twilight," refers to the period between the afternoon and evening, a time of transition and reflection. This practice underscores the importance of regular, consistent worship, both morning and evening, symbolizing a life wholly dedicated to God. The daily sacrifices were a constant reminder of the Israelites' dependence on God and their covenant relationship with Him. This practice can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament call for believers to offer themselves as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>with the same grain offering and drink offering as in the morning</b><br>The grain and drink offerings accompanying the lamb were expressions of gratitude and acknowledgment of God's provision. The grain offering, often consisting of fine flour mixed with oil, represents the fruit of human labor and God's sustenance. The drink offering, typically wine, symbolizes joy and celebration. By offering these elements both morning and evening, the Israelites demonstrated their continual reliance on God's provision and their commitment to honoring Him with the fruits of their labor. This practice foreshadows the Eucharist in Christian tradition, where bread and wine are used to remember Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>as a pleasing aroma</b><br>The phrase "a pleasing aroma" indicates that the offerings were acceptable and delightful to God. This anthropomorphic expression suggests that God takes pleasure in the obedience and worship of His people. The concept of a pleasing aroma is recurrent in the Old Testament, symbolizing the acceptability of the sacrifice when offered with a sincere heart. In the New Testament, Christ's sacrifice is described as a fragrant offering to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), fulfilling and surpassing the Old Testament sacrifices.<p><b>a food offering to the LORD</b><br>The term "food offering" emphasizes the idea of providing sustenance, not in the literal sense for God, but as a symbolic act of fellowship and communion. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where offerings are a means of maintaining and expressing that relationship. The offerings were not just ritualistic acts but were intended to be expressions of devotion and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. This concept is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate offering, providing eternal sustenance and reconciliation with God (<a href="/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the consecration of the priests and the offerings from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>The first priests of Israel, who were to be consecrated through the offerings described in this chapter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among His people, where the offerings were to be made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamb.htm">The Lamb</a></b><br>A sacrificial animal, symbolizing innocence and purity, offered to God as a part of the daily sacrifices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who commanded these offerings as a means of maintaining a relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_consistency_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Consistency in Worship</a></b><br>The daily offering of the lambs, both morning and evening, highlights the need for regular and consistent worship in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_sacrifice.htm">Symbolism of Sacrifice</a></b><br>The lamb as a sacrificial animal points to Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.

By bracketing the day with sacrifice&#8212;morning and evening&#8212;Israel lived in constant reminder that atonement and fellowship with God cover every hour (<a href="/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3-4</a>).<p>- The faithful repetition reflects God&#8217;s desire for consistency, not mere ceremony (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a> compares evening sacrifice with prayer).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the same grain offering and drink offering as in the morning</b><p>- <a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a> details the morning portion: &#8220;with one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter hin of beaten oil of pressed olives, and a drink offering of a quarter hin of wine.&#8221; The evening lamb received the identical accompaniments.<p>&#8226; Fine flour: symbol of the best produce (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Oil: picture of blessing and the Spirit&#8217;s empowering (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>b).<p>&#8226; Wine: sign of joy and covenant fellowship (<a href="/judges/9-13.htm">Judges 9:13</a>).<p>- The matching offerings show God&#8217;s standards don&#8217;t fluctuate with time of day or human mood; His holiness and grace remain steady (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>- <a href="/numbers/28-5.htm">Numbers 28:5-8</a> repeats the recipe and adds, &#8220;an aroma pleasing to the LORD,&#8221; underscoring that obedience, not innovation, pleases Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD.</b><p>- &#8220;Pleasing aroma&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>) reveals God&#8217;s favorable acceptance.

Believers now present their bodies &#8220;as a living sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>), echoing the continual devotion modeled in <a href="/exodus/29-41.htm">Exodus 29:41</a>.<p>- Paul alludes to this fragrance language when he calls the Philippians&#8217; gift &#8220;a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>), showing the principle still functions in Christian stewardship and worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/29-41.htm">Exodus 29:41</a> instructs Israel to mirror the morning burnt offering with an identical evening sacrifice&#8212;lamb, grain, oil, and wine&#8212;so the entire day is wrapped in atonement and fellowship. The unchanging recipe underlines God&#8217;s constancy and the necessity of wholehearted, ongoing devotion.
