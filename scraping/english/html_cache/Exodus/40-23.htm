The bread, known as the "bread of the Presence," consisted of twelve loaves representing the twelve tribes of Israel. This act symbolizes God's provision and sustenance for His people. The arrangement of the bread was a weekly ritual, emphasizing the importance of order and obedience in worship. The table of showbread was located in the Holy Place, signifying the continual fellowship between God and Israel.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>The bread was placed "before the LORD," indicating that it was set in the presence of God, who dwelt in the Tabernacle. This highlights the sacredness of the act and the recognition of God's holiness. The phrase underscores the idea that all offerings and acts of worship are ultimately directed towards God. The presence of God in the Tabernacle foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who is Emmanuel, "God with us."<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Moses' obedience to God's specific instructions. Throughout the construction and consecration of the Tabernacle, Moses followed God's commands precisely, reflecting the importance of obedience in the covenant relationship. This obedience is a recurring theme in the Pentateuch and is crucial for maintaining the covenant blessings. It also points to Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law and the prophets, living in complete obedience to the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who was responsible for setting up the Tabernacle and arranging the elements within it according to God's instructions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites, where the bread was arranged.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bread_of_the_presence.htm">The Bread of the Presence</a></b><br>Also known as showbread, it was placed on the table in the Tabernacle as a continual offering before the LORD.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who provided specific instructions for worship and the arrangement of the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, for whom the Tabernacle served as a central place of worship and a symbol of God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Moses' careful arrangement of the bread "just as the LORD had commanded" underscores the importance of obedience in worship.
