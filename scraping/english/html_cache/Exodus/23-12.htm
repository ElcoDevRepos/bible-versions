It underscores the value of work and diligence, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-11</a>). The six-day workweek was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures, but the biblical mandate adds a divine purpose and rhythm to it.<p><b>but on the seventh day you must cease</b><br>The command to cease work on the seventh day introduces the concept of the Sabbath, a day of rest ordained by God. This is rooted in <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>, where God rested on the seventh day after creation. The Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>) and serves as a reminder of God's provision and sovereignty. It also foreshadows the ultimate rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<p><b>so that your ox and your donkey may rest</b><br>This phrase highlights the compassionate nature of God's law, extending rest to animals. It reflects God's care for all creation (<a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>) and the principle of stewardship. The rest for animals also ensures their well-being and productivity, which was vital in an agrarian society.<p><b>and the son of your maidservant may be refreshed</b><br>The inclusion of the maidservant's son emphasizes the social justice aspect of the Sabbath. It ensures that even those of lower social status benefit from rest, promoting equality and dignity for all individuals. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of caring for the marginalized and oppressed (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>).<p><b>as well as the foreign resident</b><br>The mention of the foreign resident, or sojourner, underscores the inclusive nature of God's commandments. It reflects the call for Israel to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>) and to treat foreigners with kindness and justice (<a href="/leviticus/19-33.htm">Leviticus 19:33-34</a>).

It is to be borne in mind that the foreign population of Palestine was mostly held to hard service. (See <a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17, 18</a>.)

Not even to mention their names, was to show them the greatest contempt possible; and, if followed out universally, would soon have produced an absolute oblivion of them. Moses, it may be observed, scarcely ever does mention their names. Later historians and prophets had to do so, either to deliver the true history of the Israelites, or to denounce idolatries to which they were given.
