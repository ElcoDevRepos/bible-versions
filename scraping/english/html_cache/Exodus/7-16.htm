It highlights the prophetic tradition where God communicates His will through chosen individuals. This is a continuation of the divine mission given to Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>).<p><b>&#8216;The LORD, the God of the Hebrews,</b><br>This identifies the speaker as Yahweh, the covenantal name of God, which signifies His eternal and self-existent nature.
