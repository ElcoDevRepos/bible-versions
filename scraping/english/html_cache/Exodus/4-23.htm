This designation of Israel as God's son highlights the special covenant relationship between God and the nation of Israel, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/14.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1-2</a>. The purpose of their release is to worship God, emphasizing the centrality of worship in the life of God's people. Worship here implies not just ritual acts but a life oriented towards God, as seen in the broader narrative of Exodus where the Israelites are called to serve God alone. The demand for release is not merely a request for freedom but a divine mandate, underscoring God's authority over earthly rulers.<p><b>But since you have refused to let him go,</b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to release the Israelites sets the stage for the plagues that follow. This refusal is a demonstration of Pharaoh's hardened heart, a theme that recurs throughout the Exodus narrative. It also reflects the spiritual battle between the God of Israel and the gods of Egypt, as Pharaoh is seen as a representative of these false deities. The refusal is not just a political decision but a spiritual defiance against God's will, illustrating the broader biblical theme of human rebellion against divine authority.<p><b>behold, I will kill your firstborn son!&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This pronouncement of judgment is a foreshadowing of the final and most severe plague&#8212;the death of the firstborn in Egypt. The firstborn in ancient cultures, including Egypt, held a place of prominence and inheritance, making this judgment particularly devastating. This act of judgment is both a direct response to Pharaoh's actions and a demonstration of God's power and justice. It also serves as a type of Christ, as the death of the firstborn in Egypt prefigures the sacrificial death of Jesus, God's only Son, for the redemption of humanity. The Passover, which commemorates the sparing of the Israelite firstborn, becomes a foundational event pointing to Christ's atoning sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

It is the Creator&#8217;s authoritative summons to Pharaoh, a ruler who styles himself a god yet is being confronted by the true God (<a href="/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal reading shows God&#8217;s personal involvement: He Himself has spoken. There is no room to doubt the certainty of the command or His resolve to see it obeyed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that he may worship Me</b><p>&#8226; Deliverance has purpose: freedom to worship.

In an honor-based society, the firstborn represents strength, future, and legacy; God is striking at Egypt&#8217;s pride and security.<p>&#8226; The judgment mirrors Egypt&#8217;s earlier violence against Israel&#8217;s sons (<a href="/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15-22</a>).
