It reflects the divine authority behind the actions that are about to unfold. This communication is consistent with the pattern of God speaking to His chosen leaders throughout the Old Testament, such as with Abraham and later with the prophets.<p><b>Tell Aaron</b><br>Aaron, Moses' brother, serves as his spokesperson. This arrangement was established earlier due to Moses' reluctance and claimed lack of eloquence. Aaron's role is significant as it demonstrates the importance of teamwork and delegation in leadership. It also foreshadows the establishment of the Levitical priesthood, with Aaron as the first high priest.<p><b>&#8216;Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt</b><br>The staff is a symbol of authority and divine power. It was previously used in <a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2-4</a> when God turned it into a serpent. Stretching out the hand signifies an act of command and control, often seen in biblical miracles. This act prefigures the miracles of Jesus, who also performed signs over nature, such as calming the storm.<p><b>&#8212;over their rivers and canals and ponds and all the reservoirs&#8212;</b><br>This comprehensive list indicates the totality of the plague's impact, affecting all water sources in Egypt. The Nile River, central to Egyptian life and economy, was considered sacred and a source of life. This plague directly challenges the Egyptian gods associated with the Nile, such as Hapi, the god of the annual flooding of the Nile.<p><b>that they may become blood.&#8217;</b><br>The transformation of water into blood is a miraculous act that signifies judgment and the power of God over creation. Blood, often associated with life, here becomes a symbol of death and divine retribution. This act prefigures the first miracle of Jesus at Cana, where He turned water into wine, symbolizing the new covenant in His blood.<p><b>There will be blood throughout the land of Egypt</b><br>The pervasive nature of this plague underscores the severity of God's judgment against Egypt. It serves as a sign to both the Egyptians and the Israelites of God's supreme power. This widespread impact is a precursor to the final plague, the death of the firstborn, which ultimately leads to the Exodus.<p><b>even in the vessels of wood and stone.</b><br>This detail highlights the thoroughness of the plague, affecting not only natural water sources but also stored water. It signifies that no part of Egyptian life is untouched by God's judgment. The mention of wood and stone vessels may also symbolize the futility of relying on man-made objects or idols for salvation, contrasting with the living God who controls all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is demonstrating His power over the gods of Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and spokesperson, who acts on Moses' behalf by performing the miracles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, ruled by Pharaoh, and the setting for the plagues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plague_of_blood.htm">The Plague of Blood</a></b><br>The first of the ten plagues, where the waters of Egypt are turned to blood as a sign of God's power and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Creation</a></b><br>God demonstrates His absolute control over nature, reminding us that He is the Creator and Sustainer of all things.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_mercy.htm">Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>The plagues serve as both a judgment against Egypt and a means of deliverance for Israel, illustrating God's justice and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Moses and Aaron's obedience in performing God's commands is a model for us to follow God's instructions, even when they seem daunting.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God&#8217;s Word</a></b><br>The transformation of water to blood shows the power of God's word, encouraging us to trust in His promises and commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_hardness_of_heart.htm">The Hardness of Heart</a></b><br>Pharaoh's resistance to God's signs warns us of the dangers of hardening our hearts against God's will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_7_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 7:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_7_19_God_s_power_over_nature.htm">How does Exodus 7:19 demonstrate God's power over nature and false gods?

There is no other stream but the Nile in the whole country; and there are no natural springs, fountains, or brooks. Water may, however, at all times, and in all parts of the Nile Valley, be obtained by digging wells; but, as the soil is impregnated with nitre, the well water is highly unpalatable.
