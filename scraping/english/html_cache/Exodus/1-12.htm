This Pharaoh feared the growing population of the Israelites and sought to suppress them through forced labor. This phrase highlights a recurring biblical theme where God's people often face persecution and hardship. Historically, the oppression included harsh labor conditions, as described in <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>, where the Israelites were forced to build store cities for Pharaoh. This oppression can be seen as a test of faith and endurance, similar to the trials faced by other biblical figures such as Job.<p><b>the more they multiplied and flourished</b><br>Despite the harsh conditions, the Israelites continued to grow in number and strength. This multiplication can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>, where God promised to make Abraham's descendants a great nation. The flourishing of the Israelites under oppression is a testament to God's providence and faithfulness. It also serves as a type of Christ, who, despite persecution and suffering, brought forth salvation and growth for the Church. This resilience is echoed in the New Testament, where the early Church grew despite persecution (<a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8:1-4</a>).<p><b>so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites</b><br>The Egyptians' dread of the Israelites reflects a common biblical motif where the enemies of God's people fear their growth and potential. This fear led to further attempts to suppress the Israelites, including the decree to kill all newborn Hebrew boys (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>). The dread can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to make Israel a powerful nation that would be a source of blessing and fear to others (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). This situation foreshadows the eventual Exodus, where God's power would be displayed through the plagues and the parting of the Red Sea, leading to the liberation of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the children of Israel, who were living in Egypt and experiencing oppression under Pharaoh's rule.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt, who were led by Pharaoh and became increasingly fearful and oppressive towards the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who initiated the oppression of the Israelites due to fear of their growing numbers and potential power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/oppression.htm">Oppression</a></b><br>The harsh treatment and forced labor imposed on the Israelites by the Egyptians in an attempt to control their population and power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/multiplication_and_flourishing.htm">Multiplication and Flourishing</a></b><br>Despite the oppression, the Israelites continued to grow in number and strength, which was a testament to God's blessing and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_adversity.htm">God's Sovereignty in Adversity</a></b><br>Despite human attempts to thwart God's plans, His purposes prevail.
