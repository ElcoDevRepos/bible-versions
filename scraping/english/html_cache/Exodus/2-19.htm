The context is Moses fleeing Egypt after killing an Egyptian taskmaster. The shepherds here represent local men who were harassing the daughters of Reuel (also known as Jethro), a Midianite priest. This incident highlights Moses' character as a deliverer, foreshadowing his future role in leading the Israelites out of Egypt. The theme of rescue and deliverance is a recurring motif in the Bible, pointing to God's intervention through chosen individuals.<p><b>they replied.</b><br>The daughters of Reuel are speaking to their father. This interaction takes place in Midian, a region east of the Sinai Peninsula. The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah, indicating a distant kinship with the Israelites. The daughters' response to their father shows the cultural norm of reporting daily activities and significant events to the head of the household, reflecting a patriarchal society.<p><b>He even drew water for us</b><br>Moses' action of drawing water is significant, as it demonstrates humility and service. In the ancient Near East, drawing water was typically a task for women or servants, not for men of status. This act of service prefigures Christ, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). Water is also a symbol of life and sustenance, and Moses providing it foreshadows his role in bringing forth water from the rock in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>).<p><b>and watered the flock.</b><br>By watering the flock, Moses not only aids the daughters but also ensures the well-being of their livestock, which was a critical resource for survival and wealth in ancient times. This act of kindness and provision mirrors the pastoral care that God provides for His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>. It also prefigures Jesus as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), who cares for His flock. Moses' actions here set the stage for his future leadership and shepherding of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>At this point in the account, Moses is living in Midian after fleeing Egypt.
