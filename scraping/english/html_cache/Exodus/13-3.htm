This phrase highlights his role as a mediator between God and the Israelites. Moses' leadership is crucial during the Exodus, as he guides the people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<p><b>Remember this day</b><br>The act of remembering is significant in biblical tradition, serving as a call to recall God's mighty acts and faithfulness. This command to remember is not just a mental exercise but involves active commemoration, often through rituals and celebrations, such as the Passover.<p><b>the day you came out of Egypt</b><br>This refers to the historical event of the Exodus, when the Israelites were freed from Egyptian bondage. It marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history, symbolizing liberation and the beginning of their journey to the Promised Land. The Exodus is a foundational narrative for understanding God's deliverance and covenant with His people.<p><b>out of the house of slavery</b><br>Egypt is described as a "house of slavery," emphasizing the harsh conditions and oppression the Israelites faced. This phrase underscores the transformation from bondage to freedom, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture and is often paralleled with spiritual liberation from sin.<p><b>for the LORD brought you out of it by the strength of His hand</b><br>This emphasizes God's direct intervention and power in delivering the Israelites. The "strength of His hand" is a metaphor for God's mighty and sovereign action. It highlights that the Exodus was not achieved by human effort but by divine power, showcasing God's supremacy over earthly powers.<p><b>And nothing leavened shall be eaten</b><br>The prohibition against leavened bread is part of the Passover observance, symbolizing purity and separation from sin. Leaven, or yeast, often represents sin and corruption in biblical symbolism. The unleavened bread serves as a reminder of the haste in which the Israelites left Egypt and the need for spiritual readiness and purity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

As, however, ab means "greenness" in Hebrew, and <span class="accented">abib</span> "green ears of corn," while <span class="accented">ibba</span> meant "fruit" in Chaldee (<a href="/daniel/4-12.htm">Daniel 4:12, 14</a>), and <span class="accented">abbon</span> means "green herbs" in Arabic, there is no need of a foreign derivation for the word. The month of "greenness," or of "green ears of corn," would be both appropriate and intelligible. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/13-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">told</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
