The act of "crossing over" signifies moving from one state to another, in this case, from being uncounted to being part of the community. This concept of a census is seen in other parts of the Bible, such as <a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2-3</a>, where God commands Moses to take a census of the entire Israelite community. The census was not merely for counting but had spiritual significance, emphasizing the value of each life before God.<p><b>must pay a half shekel</b><br>The half shekel was a specific amount of money required from each person. This payment was a form of atonement, symbolizing the redemption of the individual. The half shekel was a small amount, ensuring that it was affordable for everyone, reflecting the principle that all are equal before God. This concept of redemption through payment is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ is seen as the ultimate ransom for humanity (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>according to the sanctuary shekel</b><br>The sanctuary shekel was a standard weight used in the tabernacle, ensuring uniformity and fairness in the offering. This standardization reflects God's order and justice, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35-36</a>, where God commands honest scales and measures. The sanctuary shekel's use underscores the sacredness of the transaction, as it was directly related to the worship and service of God.<p><b>which weighs twenty gerahs</b><br>A gerah was a small unit of weight, and twenty gerahs made up a shekel. This precise measurement highlights the importance of accuracy and integrity in offerings to God. The detailed description of weights and measures in the Bible, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/45-12.htm">Ezekiel 45:12</a>, emphasizes the need for honesty and precision in dealings with God and others.<p><b>This half shekel is an offering to the LORD</b><br>The half shekel was not just a tax or fee but an offering to God, signifying devotion and obedience. Offerings in the Bible are acts of worship and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. This particular offering was used for the maintenance of the tabernacle, the place where God's presence dwelled among His people. The concept of offerings is central to biblical worship, as seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to offer themselves as living sacrifices to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the law from God on Mount Sinai, including the instructions for the census tax.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where offerings and sacrifices were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary_shekel.htm">The Sanctuary Shekel</a></b><br>A unit of currency used in the tabernacle, specifically for offerings and temple service.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who commanded the census and the offering as a means of atonement and service.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_atonement.htm">The Principle of Atonement</a></b><br>The half shekel offering was a means of atonement, reminding us of our need for reconciliation with God.

The crossing-over act underscores personal responsibility before God&#8212;each man steps forward, acknowledging the Lord&#8217;s rule over his life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to those counted</b><p>Being &#8220;counted&#8221; meant inclusion in the covenant community and the army of Israel (<a href="/numbers/26-2.htm">Numbers 26:2</a>). David&#8217;s later misuse of a census in <a href="/2_samuel/24-1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1&#8211;10</a> highlights why God attached a payment here: to remind Israel that strength comes from the Lord, not head-counts (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). The census was legitimate only when directed by God and conducted His way.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>must pay a half shekel</b><p>The payment was fixed&#8212;neither wealth nor poverty altered it (<a href="/exodus/30-15.htm">Exodus 30:15</a>).

Like the Passover lamb in <a href="/bsb/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, the ransom money pointed ahead to Christ, who &#8220;gave Himself as a ransom for all&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs</b><p>God set the standard, preventing inflation or manipulation. <a href="/leviticus/27-25.htm">Leviticus 27:25</a> reminds Israel that all valuations had to match the sanctuary measure.

Of our money. Their average weight was about 220 grains troy. In Moses's time coins were unknown, and a half-shekel was a small lump of silver, unstamped, weighing probably about 110 grains. The ransom of a soul was doubtless made thus light in order that the payment might not be felt practically as a burthen by any.<p><span class= "bld">After the shekel of the sanctuary.</span>--Without a standard laid up somewhere, weights and measures will always fluctuate largely. Even with a standard, they will practically vary considerably. The "shekel of the sanctuary" probably designates a standard weight kept carefully by the priests with the vessels of the sanctuary.
