This haste is significant as it fulfills God's promise to deliver His people swiftly (<a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>). The rapid departure also prefigures the urgency of salvation in the New Testament, where believers are called to respond promptly to God's call (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>).<p><b>the Egyptians urged the people on</b><br>The Egyptians' insistence on the Israelites' departure highlights the fear and desperation that gripped Egypt after the plagues. This moment marks a reversal of the previous oppression, as the Egyptians now implore the Israelites to leave. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land but would eventually be delivered (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>). The urging also symbolizes the breaking of the chains of slavery, a type of the spiritual liberation found in Christ (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<p><b>&#8220;For otherwise,&#8221; they said, &#8220;we are all going to die!&#8221;</b><br>The Egyptians' fear of death underscores the severity of God's judgment and the recognition of His power. This statement reflects the realization that the God of Israel is sovereign over life and death, a theme that runs throughout Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>). The fear of death here can be paralleled with the fear of eternal death, from which Christ delivers believers (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The Egyptians' acknowledgment of potential death also serves as a warning of the consequences of hardening one's heart against God, as Pharaoh did.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt who were experiencing the consequences of the plagues sent by God.

It also accounts for the readiness of the Egyptians to part with their "jewels" and "raiment" (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm" title="And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:">Exodus 12:35</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> <span class="cmt_word">The Egyptians were urgent upon the people</span>.
