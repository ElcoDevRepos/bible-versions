The death of the firstborn is a direct challenge to the Egyptian belief system, where the firstborn held a special status and were often seen as heirs to family legacy and divine favor. This plague demonstrates God's sovereignty over life and death, contrasting the impotence of the Egyptian gods. It also foreshadows the sacrificial system in Israel, where the firstborn of every womb was consecrated to God (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>).<p><b>from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne</b><br>Pharaoh was considered a god-king in Egyptian culture, and his firstborn son was the heir apparent, often seen as a future deity. The death of Pharaoh's firstborn would have been a profound blow to the Egyptian royal family and their claims of divine status. This act underscores the futility of Pharaoh's resistance against God's will and serves as a direct affront to the Egyptian pantheon, particularly against deities associated with kingship and succession.<p><b>to the firstborn of the servant girl behind the hand mill</b><br>This phrase highlights the universality of the plague, affecting all social strata in Egypt. The servant girl represents the lowest rung of society, yet her firstborn is equally subject to the judgment of God. This demonstrates that God's justice is impartial and that no one, regardless of status, is exempt from His decrees. It also emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the plague, affecting every household in Egypt.<p><b>as well as the firstborn of all the cattle</b><br>The inclusion of cattle in this judgment further illustrates the totality of the plague's impact. Cattle were vital to the Egyptian economy and religious practices, often associated with fertility and strength. The death of the firstborn cattle signifies a blow to Egypt's agricultural wealth and religious symbolism. This aspect of the plague also prefigures the sacrificial system in Israel, where animals played a crucial role in atonement and worship, pointing ultimately to Christ as the sacrificial Lamb.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart was hardened against letting the Israelites go, leading to the plagues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved, and where God demonstrated His power through the plagues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/firstborn.htm">Firstborn</a></b><br>Refers to the firstborn sons of both humans and animals in Egypt, who were to die as part of the final plague.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant_girl.htm">Servant Girl</a></b><br>Represents the lowest social class in Egypt, indicating that the plague would affect all levels of society.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cattle.htm">Cattle</a></b><br>The livestock of Egypt, which were also affected by the plague, showing the comprehensive nature of God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>This passage demonstrates God's ultimate authority over life and death, emphasizing His power to execute judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_disobedience.htm">The Cost of Disobedience</a></b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to heed God's command resulted in severe consequences, reminding us of the importance of obedience to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_judgment.htm">Universal Judgment</a></b><br>The plague affected all levels of Egyptian society, illustrating that God's judgment is impartial and comprehensive.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/protection_through_obedience.htm">Protection through Obedience</a></b><br>The subsequent Passover event shows that obedience to God's instructions provides protection and deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/foreshadowing_of_christ.htm">Foreshadowing of Christ</a></b><br>The death of the firstborn in Egypt points to the sacrificial death of Jesus, the firstborn over all creation, who provides salvation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_11_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 11:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_11_5_God_s_power_over_life_death.htm">How does Exodus 11:5 demonstrate God's power and authority over life and death?

The verse underscores His absolute authority, the certainty of His promises, and the futility of resisting His will. By striking the firstborn, God liberates His covenant people and reveals that status, power, or occupation offer no refuge from His righteous justice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">All the firstborn . . . shall die.</span>--The Heb. word translated <span class= "ital">firstborn</span> is applied only to males; and thus the announcement was that in every family the eldest <span class= "ital">son</span> should be cut off. In Egypt, as in most other countries, the law of primogeniture prevailed--the eldest son was the hope, stay, and support of the household, his father's companion, his mother's joy, the object of his brothers' and sisters' reverence. The firstborn of the Pharaoh bore the title of <span class= "ital">erpa suten sa,</span> or "hereditary crown prince," and succeeded his father, unless he died or was formally set aside during his father's lifetime. Among the nobles, estates were inherited, and sometimes titles descended to the firstborn. No greater affliction can be conceived, short of the general destruction of the people, than the sudden death in every family of him round whom the highest interests and fondest hopes clustered.<p><span class= "bld">The maidservant that is behind the mill</span> marks the lowest grade in the social scale, as the king that sits upon his throne marks the highest. All alike were to suffer. In every family there was to be one dead (<a href="/exodus/12-30.htm" title="And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.">Exodus 12:30</a>).<p><span class= "bld">All the firstborn of beasts.</span>--The aggravation of the calamity by its extension to beasts is very remarkable, and is probably to be connected with the Egyptian animal-worship. At all times there were in Egypt four animals regarded as actual incarnations of deity, and the objects of profound veneration. Three of these were bulls, while one was a white cow. It is not unlikely that all were required to be "firstborns;" in which case the whole of Egypt would have been plunged into a religious mourning on account of their deaths, in addition to the domestic mourning that must have prevailed in each house. The deaths of other sacred animals, and of many pet animals in houses, would have increased the general consternation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the first-born</span>. The law of primogeniture prevailed in Egypt, as among most of the nations of antiquity. The monarchy (under the New Empire, at any rate) was hereditary, and the eldest son was known as <span class="accented">erpa suten sa</span>, or "hereditary Crown Prince." Estates descended to the eldest son, and in many cases high dignities also. No severer blow could have been sent on the nation, if it were not to be annihilated, than the less in each house of the hope of the family - the parents' stay, the other children's guardian and protector. <span class="cmt_word">Who sitteth</span>. "Sitteth" refers to "Pharaoh," not to "first-born." The meaning is, "from the first-born of the king who occupies the throne to the first-born of the humblest slave or servant. This last is represented by the <span class="cmt_word">handmaid who is behind the mill</span>; since grinding at a mill was regarded as one of the severest and most irksome forms of labour. The work was commonly assigned to captives (<a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1, 2</a>; <a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>). It was done by either one or two persons sitting, and consisted in rotating rapidly the upper millstone upon the lower by means of a handle. <span class="cmt_word">All the first-born of beasts</span>. Not the first-born of cattle only, but of all beasts. The Egyptians had pet animals in most houses, dogs, apes, monkeys, perhaps cats and ichneumons. Most temples had sacred animals, and in most districts of Egypt, some beasts were regarded as sacred, and might not be killed, their death being viewed as a calamity. The loss of so many animals would consequently be felt by the Egyptians as a sensible aggravation of the infliction. It would wound them both in their domestic and in their religious sensibilities. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/11-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and every</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">firstborn son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1060.htm">Strong's 1060: </a> </span><span class="str2">Firstborn, chief</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
