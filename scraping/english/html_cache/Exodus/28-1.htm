Aaron, Moses' older brother, is chosen by God to be the first high priest of Israel. This selection underscores the importance of family lineage in the priesthood, as Aaron's descendants would continue this role. The calling of Aaron also signifies the beginning of the formal priesthood in Israel, which would play a crucial role in mediating between God and the people.<p><b>from among the Israelites</b><br>Aaron is chosen from among the Israelites, emphasizing that the priesthood is to be an integral part of the Israelite community. This selection from among the people signifies that the priests are representatives of the people before God. It also highlights the concept of being set apart for a holy purpose, a theme that runs throughout the Bible, where God often chooses individuals from among His people for specific tasks.<p><b>along with his sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar</b><br>Aaron's sons are also appointed to the priesthood, establishing a hereditary priestly line. Nadab and Abihu, the elder sons, would later face consequences for offering unauthorized fire before the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>), illustrating the seriousness of their sacred duties. Eleazar and Ithamar would continue the priestly line, with Eleazar eventually succeeding Aaron as high priest. This familial aspect of the priesthood points to the importance of legacy and continuity in spiritual leadership.<p><b>to serve Me as priests</b><br>The primary role of Aaron and his sons is to serve God as priests. This service includes performing sacrifices, maintaining the tabernacle, and teaching the law to the people. The priesthood is a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest, mediating between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).

Perhaps in consequence of his original reluctance and want of faith (<a href="/exodus/3-11.htm" title="And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?">Exodus 3:11</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/4-10.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.">Exodus 4:10-13</a>), perhaps on account of Aaron's elder birth (<a href="/exodus/7-7.htm" title="And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.">Exodus 7:7</a>), it pleased God to commit the office of ministering to Him in the tabernacle, not to Moses and his descendants, but to Aaron and those sprung from his loins. In this way Aaron and his sons were <span class= "ital">"</span>drawn near" to Moses in respect of rank, position, and dignity.<p><span class= "bld">That he may minister to me in the priest's office.</span>--Or, "that he may be priest to me." The actual investiture of Aaron with the priestly office did not take place until some time after the tabernacle was completed. It is related in Leviticus 8; and his first priestly acts are recorded in the following chapter (<a href="/context/leviticus/9-8.htm" title="Aaron therefore went to the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.">Leviticus 9:8-22</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - THE HOLY GARMENTS. The special object of the present chapter is to prescribe the form, materials, colour, etc., of the holy garments - or the attire of those who were to minister in the tabernacle at the time of their ministration. As the service of the tabernacle was about to be committed to Aaron and his sons, their selection for this office is mentioned in verse 1, and their investiture and consecration briefly touched in verse 41. Otherwise the whole chapter is concerned with the attire That of Aaron is first prescribed (vers. 4-39). It consists of an ephod (vers. 6-12); a breastplate (vers. 13-30); a robe (vers. 31-35); a mitre (vers 36-38); a coat, or tunic; and a girdle (ver. 39). The dress of his sons follows. It comprises drawers (ver. 42), tunics, girdles, and caps or turbans (ver. 40). Incidentally it is mentioned in verse 43, that drawers are also to be worn by Aaron; and, in conclusion, the neglect of this ordinance in the case of either Aaron or his sons is forbidden under penalty of death <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take thou unto thee</span>. Literally, "Make to draw near to thee." Moses had hitherto been of all the people the one nearest to God, <span class="accented">the</span> medium of communication. He was now to abdicate a portion of his functions, transferring them to his brother and his brother's sons. By this act he would draw them nearer to him than they were before. It is worthy of remark that he makes no remonstrance or opposition, but carries out God's will in this matter as readily and willingly as in all others. (See <a href="/leviticus/8-4.htm">Leviticus 8:4-30</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">From among the children of Israel</span>. The LXX. reads "And from among the children of Israel," as if others besides the family of Aaron had been admitted to the priesthood. But this is contrary to the entire tenor of the later narrative. The existing Hebrew text is correct. <span class="cmt_word">Nadab and Abihu</span>, and again, <span class="cmt_word">Eleazar and Ithamar</span>, are always coupled together in the Pentateuch (<a href="/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1, 12</a>; etc.), while a marked division is made between the two pairs of brothers. It is probably the sin and early death of the two elder (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>) that causes the separation. Of Ithamar after the death of his brothers, nothing is known. Eleazar became high priest (<a href="/numbers/34-17.htm">Numbers 34:17</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/17-4.htm">Joshua 17:4</a>; etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/28-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Next,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1441;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
