The groaning refers to the cries of distress from the Israelites under harsh slavery. This highlights God's compassion and responsiveness to human suffering. In the biblical context, groaning often signifies deep distress and a plea for divine intervention, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>, where the Spirit intercedes with groans too deep for words. Theologically, it underscores the belief that God is not distant but actively listens to the cries of His people.<p><b>and He remembered His covenant</b><br>The concept of God "remembering" does not imply that He forgets, but rather that He is about to act in accordance with His promises. The covenant mentioned here is a binding agreement initiated by God, emphasizing His faithfulness and commitment. This covenantal relationship is central to the narrative of the Bible, where God consistently acts in history to fulfill His promises. The remembrance of the covenant is a turning point, indicating that God is about to intervene in a significant way, as seen in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt.<p><b>with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</b><br>This phrase roots the narrative in the patriarchal promises found in Genesis. The covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob includes promises of land, descendants, and blessing (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3, 26</a>:3-4, 28:13-15). These patriarchs are foundational figures in Israel's history, and God's faithfulness to them is a recurring theme throughout Scripture. The mention of these patriarchs connects the Exodus story to the broader narrative of God's redemptive plan, which ultimately points to Jesus Christ, a descendant of Abraham, through whom all nations would be blessed (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who hears the cries of His people and remembers His covenant promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are suffering under Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, representing oppression and hardship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham,_isaac,_and_jacob.htm">Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarchs with whom God made His covenant, promising them descendants and a land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>The divine promise made by God to the patriarchs, ensuring His faithfulness and commitment to their descendants.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is always faithful to His promises, even when circumstances seem dire.
