The mention of specific animals and items reflects the agrarian lifestyle of the Israelites, where livestock and garments were valuable assets. The law aims to protect individuals from theft and false claims, ensuring justice and fairness. The principle of restitution is rooted in the broader biblical theme of justice, as seen in other passages like <a href="/leviticus/6.htm">Leviticus 6:1-5</a>, which also deals with restitution for wrongs.<p><b>both parties shall bring their cases before the judges.</b><br>The role of judges in ancient Israel was crucial for maintaining order and justice. Judges were responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that disputes were resolved fairly. This reflects the judicial system established by Moses, as advised by Jethro in <a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>, where capable men were appointed to judge the people at all times. The presence of judges underscores the importance of community and accountability in resolving conflicts.<p><b>The one whom the judges find guilty must pay back double to his neighbor.</b><br>The requirement to pay back double serves as both a punishment and a deterrent against theft and false claims. This principle of restitution is consistent with the biblical concept of justice, where the wrongdoer must make amends for their actions. The idea of paying back double is also seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30-31</a>, where a thief must repay sevenfold. This reflects God's desire for restoration and reconciliation within the community. The concept of restitution can also be seen as a type of Christ, who paid the ultimate price for humanity's sins, offering redemption and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, judges were appointed to resolve disputes and ensure justice according to God's laws.

A thief repaying double publicly acknowledges that sin costs more than it gains (<a href="/2_samuel/12-6.htm">2 Samuel 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle points forward to the transforming power of repentance: Zacchaeus, touched by Christ, offered fourfold restitution, exceeding the law&#8217;s minimum (<a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>). Genuine faith produces tangible fruit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/22-9.htm">Exodus 22:9</a> sets out God&#8217;s just remedy when ownership is disputed. Every kind of property matters to Him, honesty must govern every claim, disputes go to impartial judges, and proven guilt requires double restitution. By upholding these principles, the community mirrors God&#8217;s own righteousness&#8212;protecting the innocent, restraining the dishonest, and encouraging heartfelt repentance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">For all manner of trespass.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">in every case of fraud. </span>The context limits the expression to cases of fraud, or alleged fraud, <span class= "ital">in connection with a deposit.</span><p><span class= "bld">For ox, for ass, for sheep.</span>--The deposit of animals is unknown in classical antiquity, but might well be the custom of a people whose wealth consisted in flocks and herds.

He was in that case to appear before the judges (<a href="/exodus/18-23.htm">Exodus 18:23</a>), together with his accuser, and to clear himself if he could.
