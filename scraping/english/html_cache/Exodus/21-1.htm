These are part of the covenantal laws that follow the Ten Commandments, providing detailed applications for the community. The Hebrew word used here is "mishpatim," which often denotes judgments or legal decisions. This indicates a structured legal system intended to guide the moral and social conduct of the Israelites. The ordinances are part of the broader Mosaic Law, which includes moral, ceremonial, and civil laws. These laws reflect God's character and His desire for justice and righteousness among His people.<p><b>that you are to set before them:</b><br>Moses is instructed to present these laws to the Israelites, emphasizing the role of leadership in teaching and upholding God's commandments. The phrase "set before them" implies clarity and accessibility, ensuring that the people understand the laws they are to follow. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God provides guidance, and the people are expected to obey. The setting of these laws before the people also foreshadows the New Covenant, where God's laws are written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).
