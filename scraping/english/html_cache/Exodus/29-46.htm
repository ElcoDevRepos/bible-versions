The use of "LORD" (YHWH) signifies God's personal name, highlighting His eternal and unchanging nature. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but experiential, as the Israelites witness God's power and faithfulness. The phrase echoes the covenant language found in <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>, where God promises to be the God of Abraham and his descendants. It underscores the purpose of God's actions&#8212;to reveal Himself to His people.<p><b>who brought them out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This refers to the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing deliverance and redemption. The Exodus is a type of Christ's redemptive work, as Jesus delivers believers from the bondage of sin (<a href="/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31</a>). The historical context of Egypt as a place of slavery contrasts with the freedom God provides. Archaeological evidence, such as the Merneptah Stele, confirms the presence of Israelites in Canaan, supporting the biblical narrative of their exodus from Egypt.<p><b>so that I might dwell among them</b><br>God's desire to dwell among His people is central to the biblical narrative, foreshadowing the incarnation of Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>) and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). The tabernacle, and later the temple, served as physical manifestations of God's presence. This dwelling signifies God's commitment to His people and His desire for a relationship with them, fulfilling promises made in <a href="/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>.<p><b>I am the LORD their God</b><br>This reiteration of God's identity reinforces His authority and the exclusive relationship He has with Israel. It serves as a reminder of His sovereignty and the obligations of the covenant. The phrase is a declaration of God's faithfulness and a call to obedience, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, where the Shema calls Israel to love the LORD with all their heart, soul, and strength.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, whom He delivered from slavery in Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing sin and oppression.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among His people, representing His presence and holiness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to bring the Israelites out of Egypt and to mediate the covenant between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_deliverance.htm">God's Deliverance</a></b><br>God is a deliverer who rescues His people from bondage, both physically and spiritually.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence.htm">God's Presence</a></b><br>The desire of God to dwell among His people highlights the importance of His presence in our lives today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_relationship.htm">Covenant Relationship</a></b><br>The relationship between God and His people is based on His covenant promises, which require faith and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_god.htm">Identity in God</a></b><br>Knowing God as "the LORD their God" shapes the identity and purpose of His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_worship.htm">Holiness and Worship</a></b><br>God's presence among His people calls for holiness and worship, as seen in the establishment of the Tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_29_46_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 29:46?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_29_46_God_s_wish_to_dwell.htm">How does Exodus 29:46 emphasize God's desire to dwell among His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_29_46_God_s_bond_with_Israel.htm">What does Exodus 29:46 reveal about God's identity and relationship with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_live_with_God_daily.htm">How can we apply the concept of God dwelling with us in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_29_46_NT_on_God_s_presence.htm">What connections exist between Exodus 29:46 and the New Testament's view of God's presence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Exodus_29_46_boost_our_faith.htm">How does understanding God's deliverance in Exodus 29:46 strengthen our faith today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_29_46_Covenant_affirmation.htm">How does Exodus 29:46 affirm God's covenant with the Israelites?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Exodus_29_46_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Exodus 29:46?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_29_46_God_s_relational_desire.htm">How does Exodus 29:46 reflect God's desire for a relationship with His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_29.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_did_israelites_survive_without_bread.htm">(Deut 29:6) If the Israelites lacked basic provisions like bread and wine, how did they realistically survive in the harsh desert environment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_would_god_allow_killing_innocents.htm">Exodus 12:29 -
