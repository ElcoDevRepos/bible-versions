Aaron, the father of the priests, was anointed as the first high priest of Israel (<a href="/exodus/29-7.htm">Exodus 29:7</a>). This anointing symbolizes the Holy Spirit's empowerment and presence, marking the priests as chosen by God. The oil used in anointing was a special blend, as described in <a href="/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-25</a>, signifying the sacredness of the act. This continuity in anointing underscores the importance of maintaining the sanctity and divine appointment of the priesthood.<p><b>so that they may also serve Me as priests</b><br>The role of the priest was to mediate between God and the people, offering sacrifices and prayers on behalf of the Israelites. This service was not just a duty but a divine calling, requiring purity and dedication. The priesthood is a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>), mediating a new covenant between God and humanity. The phrase emphasizes the purpose of the anointing: to enable the priests to fulfill their sacred duties.<p><b>Their anointing will qualify them for a permanent priesthood</b><br>The anointing confers legitimacy and authority upon the priests, establishing their role as perpetual. This permanence is a covenantal promise, reflecting God's unchanging nature and His commitment to His people. The priesthood's continuity is crucial for maintaining the spiritual health of the nation. In the New Testament, believers are described as a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), indicating that through Christ, all believers are anointed to serve God.<p><b>throughout their generations.</b><br>This phrase highlights the hereditary nature of the Aaronic priesthood, passed down through the lineage of Aaron. It underscores the importance of family and generational faithfulness in God's plan. The continuity of the priesthood serves as a reminder of God's enduring promises and the importance of legacy in faith. This generational aspect is fulfilled in Christ, whose priesthood is eternal (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a>), and through whom believers are grafted into a spiritual lineage that transcends time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to lead them through the wilderness.

He had the oil poured over his head (<a href="/leviticus/8-12.htm" title="And he poured of the anointing oil on Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.">Leviticus 8:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/133-2.htm" title="It is like the precious ointment on the head, that ran down on the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;">Psalm 133:2</a>). They were merely sprinkled with a mixture of oil and blood (<a href="/leviticus/8-30.htm" title="And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.">Leviticus 8:30</a>). The difference implied a lower degree of official holiness.<p><span class= "bld">Their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood.</span>--The Jewish commentators maintain that the one anointing of the sons of Aaron sufficed for all time, and was not repeated in the case of any subsequent priests, who became fully possessed of the sacerdotal office without it. Each high priest was, on the contrary, inducted into his office by anointing, whence the high priest came to be spoken of as "the anointed priest (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm" title="If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-5.htm" title="And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:">Leviticus 4:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-16.htm" title="And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:">Leviticus 4:16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-12.htm" title="Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is on him: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 21:12</a>, &c.). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt anoint them as thou didst anoint</span> <span class="cmt_word">their father.</span> The mode of anointing does not seem to have been identical in the two cases. The oil was first poured upon Aaron's head (<a href="/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>), and afterwards sprinkled upon him (<a href="/leviticus/8-30.htm">Leviticus 8:30</a>). It was, apparently, only sprinkled upon the priests (<span class="accented">ib</span>,). This was a lower form of anointing; and hence the high priest was sometimes called "<span class="accented">the</span> anointed priest" (<a href="/leviticus/4-5.htm">Leviticus 4:5, 16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-22.htm">Leviticus 6:22</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-32.htm">Leviticus 16:32</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood.</span> The Rabbinical commentators maintain that these words apply to the ordinary priests only, and on the strength of them establish a difference between the ordinary priests and the high priests. The latter were in every ease to be anointed to their office. A single anointing sainted for the former. It is scarcely necessary to say that there is no Scriptural ground for this distinction. The natural sense of the words is, rather, that as long as the anointing continued, the priesthood should continue. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/40-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Anoint</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#353;a&#7717;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
