The Hebrew women were the descendants of Jacob, living in Egypt since the time of Joseph. The midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, were tasked with assisting these women, highlighting the importance of their role in the community. This reflects the growing population of the Israelites, which was seen as a threat by the Egyptians.<p><b>observe them on the birthstools</b><br>The birthstools were likely a form of primitive birthing chair used in ancient times, designed to aid women during labor. This detail provides insight into the birthing practices of the time, which were communal and involved specific tools and methods. The mention of birthstools indicates a structured approach to childbirth, emphasizing the midwives' expertise and the cultural practices of the Hebrews.<p><b>If the child is a son, kill him</b><br>This command from Pharaoh represents a direct threat to the Hebrew population, aiming to curb their growth by targeting male infants. Historically, this reflects the fear of the Israelites becoming too numerous and powerful, potentially aligning with Egypt's enemies. This decree is an early example of infanticide as a tool of oppression and control, foreshadowing later biblical narratives of deliverance and survival against oppressive regimes.<p><b>but if it is a daughter, let her live</b><br>Allowing daughters to live suggests that females were not seen as a threat to Pharaoh's power. This reflects the patriarchal society of the time, where males were often seen as potential warriors or leaders. The survival of the daughters ensured the continuation of the Hebrew people, as women would eventually marry and bear children, contributing to the population's growth despite Pharaoh's efforts.<br><br>This passage sets the stage for the birth of Moses, a type of Christ, who would later deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, paralleling Jesus' role as the deliverer from sin. The decree also echoes Herod's later attempt to kill male infants in Bethlehem, further connecting Moses and Jesus as deliverers in biblical typology.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who, fearing the growing population of the Israelites, ordered the Hebrew midwives to kill all newborn Hebrew boys.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrew_midwives.htm">Hebrew Midwives</a></b><br>Women tasked with assisting Hebrew women during childbirth.

His command reveals a calculated political strategy: target the covenant people at their most vulnerable moment&#8212;childbirth. Earlier verses describe Israel&#8217;s rapid growth (<a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7, 12</a>), a fulfillment of God&#8217;s promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). Pharaoh&#8217;s fear-driven policy stands in direct opposition to God&#8217;s blessing, yet God&#8217;s purpose remains unstoppable (<a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>). The same pattern of opposition appears later when Herod seeks to destroy Jesus by ordering the death of Bethlehem&#8217;s infant boys (<a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>observe them on the birthstools</b><p>Midwives were to watch closely during labor, poised to carry out Pharaoh&#8217;s order. The &#8220;birthstool&#8221; scene emphasizes the intimate, sacred setting of new life&#8212;now threatened by state-sponsored violence. Throughout Scripture, the womb is portrayed as a place of God&#8217;s creative involvement (<a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8&#8211;12</a>). Pharaoh&#8217;s intrusion here underscores human rebellion against the Creator&#8217;s design. Yet even inside an oppressive system, God positions His people&#8212;these two midwives&#8212;to choose obedience to Him over allegiance to human authority (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If the child is a son, kill him</b><p>Pharaoh targets the males to cripple Israel&#8217;s future strength and eliminate potential warriors or deliverers. This echoes Satan&#8217;s long-standing enmity with the promised Seed (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>). The attack on boys prefigures later assaults on godly leadership, such as Athaliah&#8217;s slaughter of the royal heirs (<a href="/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1</a>). Still, Scripture affirms the sanctity of every life (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>) and the particular value God places on children (<a href="/mark/10-14.htm">Mark 10:14</a>). Shiphrah and Puah fear God more than Pharaoh, choosing civil disobedience to preserve life (<a href="/exodus/1-17.htm">Exodus 1:17</a>). Their courageous stand demonstrates that righteous action is possible, even under tyrannical commands (<a href="/hebrews/11-23.htm">Hebrews 11:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but if it is a daughter, let her live</b><p>Allowing the girls to live appears, on the surface, merciful, yet it reveals Pharaoh&#8217;s utilitarian mindset: females could be assimilated through forced marriages or servitude, diluting Israel&#8217;s identity. God, however, often works through the very daughters Pharaoh spared&#8212;Jochebed, Miriam, and Pharaoh&#8217;s own daughter play vital roles in Moses&#8217; deliverance (<a href="/exodus/2-1.htm">Exodus 2:1&#8211;10</a>). Later, women such as Deborah (<a href="/bsb/judges/4.htm">Judges 4&#8211;5</a>) and Esther (<a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>) further testify that God elevates those the world underestimates (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/1-16.htm">Exodus 1:16</a> exposes the clash between a death-driven kingdom and the life-giving purposes of God. Pharaoh&#8217;s decree attacks God&#8217;s covenant family at the point of promised multiplication, yet two ordinary midwives choose faithful resistance. Their obedience preserves life, sets the stage for Moses&#8217; birth, and advances God&#8217;s redemptive plan. The passage affirms the value of every child, calls believers to honor God above human authority, and demonstrates that no scheme of man can thwart the Lord&#8217;s sovereign purposes (<a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>; <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Upon the stools.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">upon the two stones. </span>It has been suggested that a seat corresponding to the modern <span class= "ital">hursee elwiladeh </span>is meant. This is a "chair of a peculiar form," upon which in modern Egypt the woman is seated during parturition. (See Lane, <span class= "ital">Modern Egyptians, </span>vol. iii. p. 142.) But it does not appear that this seat is composed of "two stones;" nor is there any distinct evidence of its employment at the time of child-birth in Ancient Egypt. The emendation of Hirsch--<span class= "ital">banim </span>for <span class= "ital">abnaim, </span>is very tempting.

In modern Egypt, he says, "two or three days before the expected time of delivery, the midwife conveys to the house the <span class="accented">kursee elwiladeh</span>, a chair of a peculiar form, upon which the patient is to be seated during the birth." A chair of the form intended is represented on the Egyptian monuments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/1-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;When you help the Hebrew</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1506;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;i&#7687;&#183;r&#238;&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
