In biblical symbolism, the east often represents the direction from which divine intervention or revelation comes. This orientation is consistent with other biblical structures, such as the Temple in Jerusalem, which also faced east. The eastward orientation can be seen as a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "Sun of Righteousness" in <a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>, bringing light and life to the world.<p><b>was also fifty cubits long.</b><br>The measurement of fifty cubits for the east side of the Tabernacle courtyard reflects the precise and orderly nature of God's instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle. A cubit is generally considered to be about 18 inches, making this side approximately 75 feet long. The number fifty in the Bible often signifies completion or fullness, as seen in the Year of Jubilee, which occurred every fifty years and was a time of liberation and restoration.
