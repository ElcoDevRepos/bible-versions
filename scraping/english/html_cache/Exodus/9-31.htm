These crops were essential to the Egyptian economy and daily life. Flax was used to make linen, a valuable textile, while barley was a staple food source. The destruction of these crops would have had a devastating impact on the Egyptian society, highlighting the severity of God's judgment. This event demonstrates God's power over nature and His ability to disrupt the economic and social structures of a nation.<p><b>since the barley was ripe</b><br>The timing of the plague is crucial. Barley ripens in Egypt around February or March, indicating that this plague occurred in the early spring. This detail helps to establish a timeline for the plagues and the Exodus narrative. The ripeness of the barley signifies that the harvest was imminent, making the destruction even more impactful as it would have been a time of expected abundance and provision.<p><b>and the flax was in bloom</b><br>Flax blooms around the same time as barley ripens, reinforcing the early spring setting. The blooming of flax indicates that it was at a vulnerable stage, susceptible to damage from the hail. This detail underscores the precision of God's judgment, as He targeted the crops at a time when their destruction would be most detrimental. The mention of flax also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's provision and the consequences of disobedience, as seen in other scriptural accounts where agricultural prosperity is linked to covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

God&#8217;s hand targeted Egypt&#8217;s economy just as He had promised (<a href="/exodus/9-14.htm">Exodus 9:14</a>).<p>&#8211; Egypt&#8217;s gods supposedly guarded agriculture, yet they were powerless (<a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>).<p>&#8211; Only in Goshen, where God&#8217;s people lived, was there protection (<a href="/exodus/9-26.htm">Exodus 9:26</a>), foreshadowing the salvation God supplies to those under His covenant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since the barley was ripe</b><p>&#8226; Barley heads out first, usually late winter/early spring.

Mummies also were swathed in linen bandages (Herod. ii. 86); and soldiers wore linen corselets (Herod. ii. 182, 3:47). Barley was grown as food for horses, as an element in the manufacture of beer, and as a material for an inferior kind of bread. The flax is "bolled"--i.e., forms its seed-vessel--towards the end of January or beginning of February, and the barley comes into ear about the same time. These facts fix the date of this plague, and help to fix the dates both of the earlier and the later ones.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The flax and the barley was smitten</span>. Flax was largely cultivated by the Egyptians, who preferred linen garments to any other (Herod. 2:37), and allowed the priests to wear nothing but linen. Several kinds of flax are mentioned as grown in Egypt (Plin. H. N. 19:1); and the neighbourhood of Tanis is expressly said to have been one of the places where the flax was produced. The flax is <span class="cmt_word">boiled</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> blossoms towards the end of January or beginning of February, and the barley comes into ear about the same time, being commonly cut in March. Barley was employed largely as the food of horses, and was used also for the manufacture of beer, which was a common Egyptian beverage. A certain quantity was made by the poorer classes into bread. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/9-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">(Now the flax</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hap&#183;pi&#353;&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6594.htm">Strong's 6594: </a> </span><span class="str2">Flax, a wick</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and barley</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ha&#347;&#183;&#347;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8184.htm">Strong's 8184: </a> </span><span class="str2">Barley</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were destroyed,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(nuk&#183;k&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Pual - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5221.htm">Strong's 5221: </a> </span><span class="str2">To strike</span><br /><br /><span class="word">since</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the barley</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#347;&#183;&#347;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8184.htm">Strong's 8184: </a> </span><span class="str2">Barley</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was ripe and the flax</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hap&#183;pi&#353;&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6594.htm">Strong's 6594: </a> </span><span class="str2">Flax, a wick</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[was] in bloom;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1469;&#1500;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(gi&#7687;&#183;&#8216;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1392.htm">Strong's 1392: </a> </span><span class="str2">The calyx of a, flower</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/9-31.htm">OT Law: Exodus 9:31 The flax and the barley were struck (Exo.
