This reflects the hierarchical relationship between Moses and Aaron, where Moses is the leader and Aaron serves under his authority. The term "my lord" is a respectful address, acknowledging Moses' leadership role. This moment occurs after Moses descends from Mount Sinai and witnesses the Israelites worshiping the golden calf. Aaron's attempt to pacify Moses highlights the tension and urgency of the situation. The plea for Moses not to be enraged can be seen as an attempt to deflect responsibility and mitigate the consequences of the people's actions. This phrase also underscores the gravity of the sin committed by the Israelites, as Aaron seeks to calm Moses' justified anger.<p><b>&#8220;You yourself know that the people are intent on evil.&#8221;</b><br>Aaron shifts some responsibility onto the Israelites, suggesting that their predisposition towards wrongdoing was evident. This reflects the broader biblical theme of human sinfulness and the tendency to stray from God's commandments. The phrase "intent on evil" indicates a deliberate choice by the people to engage in idolatry, despite having witnessed God's power and deliverance from Egypt. This echoes the recurring biblical narrative of Israel's rebellion and need for repentance. Aaron's statement can be seen as an acknowledgment of the Israelites' fallen nature, which is a theme throughout the Old Testament. It also foreshadows the need for a savior, as humanity's inclination towards sin necessitates divine intervention. This connects to the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the ultimate redeemer who addresses the problem of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the high priest of Israel.

Moses had just smashed the tablets after seeing the idol (<a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>), so the tension is high.<p>- Scripture underscores the place for measured, righteous anger: &#8220;Be angry, yet do not sin&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a>); Jesus Himself was angry at hardened hearts (<a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>). Still, a &#8220;gentle answer turns away wrath&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>). Aaron banks on this principle, similar to Abigail soothing David in <a href="/1_samuel/25-23.htm">1 Samuel 25:23-24</a>.<p>- The moment reminds us that while anger over sin is valid, God calls His servants to respond with wisdom and self-control (<a href="/proverbs/16-32.htm">Proverbs 16:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Aaron replied</b><p>- Aaron, the designated leader in Moses&#8217; absence (<a href="/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a>), must now give account. Scripture teaches heightened accountability for leaders: &#8220;From everyone who has been given much, much will be required&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>) and &#8220;Not many of you should become teachers&#8221; (<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>).<p>- Instead of owning his failure, Aaron starts with damage control. His hesitancy contrasts with Moses&#8217; earlier boldness to intercede for Israel (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-13</a>).<p>- Like King Saul excusing himself in <a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24</a>, Aaron shows how fear of people can eclipse fear of God&#8212;a warning for every believer entrusted with responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You yourself know that the people are intent on evil</b><p>- Aaron shifts blame to the congregation, echoing Adam&#8217;s deflection in <a href="/genesis/3-12.htm">Genesis 3:12</a>. Yet Scripture insists each person answers for personal choices (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<p>- His words acknowledge a hard truth: apart from God, human hearts are &#8220;deceitful above all things&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>) and &#8220;every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was altogether evil all the time&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>). The New Testament affirms, &#8220;There is no one righteous, not even one&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a>).<p>- Aaron&#8217;s statement unwittingly spotlights Israel&#8217;s need&#8212;and ours&#8212;for a mediator better than any human priest. <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a> presents Christ as that perfect intercessor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Aaron&#8217;s answer to Moses blends a soothing tone, an abdication of leadership, and an admission of the people&#8217;s sinful bent. His opening appeal tries to temper righteous anger, his reply exposes the weight leaders bear, and his blame-shifting highlights the universal pull toward evil. The verse calls us to respond to sin with both righteous zeal and personal responsibility, resting in the only flawless Mediator who can truly turn wayward hearts back to God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22-24) Aaron's conduct was really without excuse; but he attempts two pleas--the first insufficient, the second false and fatuous. (1) The people compelled him; they were "set on mischief;" they made the proposal--they would have it so. (2) He threw the gold into the furnace, and "it came out a calf," as if he had not ordered the construction of the mould. In Deuteronomy, Moses informs us that Aaron's whole conduct so angered God that God would have destroyed him but for his own intercession (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-20.htm" title="And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.">Deuteronomy 9:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let not the anger of my lord wax hot</span>.
