Despite this kinship, Edom often opposed Israel. The dismay of Edom's chiefs signifies the fear and awe that God's mighty acts instilled in Israel's enemies. Historically, Edom was located southeast of Israel, and its leaders would have been aware of the Israelites' journey and the miraculous events surrounding their exodus from Egypt. This fear foreshadows the eventual conflicts between Israel and Edom, as seen in <a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>, where Edom refuses Israel passage through their land.<p><b>trembling will seize the leaders of Moab;</b><br>Moab, like Edom, had familial ties to Israel, being descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew. The Moabites occupied land east of the Dead Sea. The trembling of Moab's leaders reflects the terror that God's power inspired among Israel's neighbors. This fear is later realized in the narrative of Balak, king of Moab, who sought to curse Israel through Balaam (Numbers 22-24). The mention of Moab here anticipates future interactions, including the story of Ruth, a Moabite woman who becomes an ancestor of King David and, ultimately, Jesus Christ.<p><b>those who dwell in Canaan will melt away,</b><br>Canaan was the land promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The phrase "melt away" indicates a complete loss of courage and strength among the Canaanites, who were aware of the Israelites' approach and the power of their God. This fear is confirmed in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>, where Rahab, a Canaanite, acknowledges the terror that has fallen on the inhabitants of the land. The conquest of Canaan under Joshua fulfills God's promise to give this land to Israel, and it serves as a type of the ultimate victory and rest found in Jesus Christ, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother.

Later history confirms this fear: Edom refused Israel passage (<a href="/numbers/20-17.htm">Numbers 20:17-21</a>) and is singled out for judgment because of its hostility (<a href="/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; God had already promised, &#8220;I will send My terror ahead of you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>), and Edom is the first nation named as experiencing that terror.<p>&#8226; The line underscores that God&#8217;s victory at the Red Sea immediately altered the political landscape;

Centuries later, the prophets still describe Moab&#8217;s leaders shaking before the LORD&#8217;s hand (<a href="/jeremiah/48-42.htm">Jeremiah 48:42-44</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse confirms that God&#8217;s redemptive acts reverberate: what He did at the sea echoed across desert borders, gripping Moabite rulers who prided themselves on strongholds like Ar (<a href="/numbers/21-28.htm">Numbers 21:28</a>).<p>&#8226; This sets the stage for the book of Ruth&#8212;where Moabites meet Yahweh&#8217;s covenant mercy&#8212;showing that fear can become an avenue for redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those who dwell in Canaan will melt away</b><p>&#8226;

This prophecy received a remarkable accomplishment when "it came to pass that all the kings of the Cannanites heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, and their heart melted, neither was their spirit in them any more" (<a href="/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/15-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1444;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_227.htm">Strong's 227: </a> </span><span class="str2">At that time, place, therefore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the chiefs</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al&#183;l&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_441.htm">Strong's 441: </a> </span><span class="str2">Familiar, a friend, gentle, a bullock, a chieftain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Edom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1491;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_123.htm">Strong's 123: </a> </span><span class="str2">The name of a condiment</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be dismayed;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#7687;&#183;ha&#774;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_926.htm">Strong's 926: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tremble inwardly, be, alarmed, agitated, to hasten anxiously</span><br /><br /><span class="word">trembling</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8216;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7461.htm">Strong's 7461: </a> </span><span class="str2">A trembling</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will seize</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1495;&#1458;&#1494;&#1461;&#1430;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;z&#234;&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
