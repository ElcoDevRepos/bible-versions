The "three-day journey" is significant, as the number three often represents completeness or divine perfection in the Bible. The wilderness is a place of testing and reliance on God, as seen in Israel's later wanderings and Jesus' temptation (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>). The journey foreshadows the greater exodus from sin through Christ.<p><b>and sacrifice to the LORD our God</b><br>Sacrifice is central to Israelite worship, signifying atonement and dedication to God. This act of worship in the wilderness underscores the importance of obedience and devotion. Sacrifices point to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The phrase emphasizes the necessity of worshiping God according to His instructions, not human convenience.<p><b>as He commands us.</b><br>This highlights the importance of divine instruction and obedience. God's commands are not arbitrary but are given for the benefit and sanctification of His people. The Israelites' adherence to God's commands prefigures the New Covenant, where believers are called to follow Christ's teachings. This obedience is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing that true worship is done in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.
