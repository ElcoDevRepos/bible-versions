The "them" refers to the inhabitants of Canaan, including the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. These nations were known for their idolatrous practices and moral corruption. The prohibition against making covenants is a safeguard to prevent the Israelites from being influenced by pagan customs and beliefs. Historically, covenants were binding agreements that often included mutual obligations and could lead to alliances that compromised religious and cultural integrity. This command underscores the importance of remaining distinct and faithful to God's laws, avoiding syncretism and the dilution of their faith.<p><b>or with their gods</b><br>The gods of the Canaanites were numerous and included deities like Baal and Asherah, who were worshipped through rituals that often involved immoral practices. The Israelites are warned against forming any agreements that would acknowledge or legitimize these false gods. This phrase highlights the exclusivity of worship that God demands, as seen in the First Commandment: "You shall have no other gods before Me" (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). Theologically, this reflects the monotheistic foundation of Israel's faith and the call to worship Yahweh alone. The warning also serves as a prophetic insight into the future struggles Israel would face with idolatry, as seen in the books of Judges and Kings. This command is a type of Christ, who fulfills the law and calls His followers to a pure and undivided devotion to God, as seen in His teachings in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being instructed in this passage.

The "Book of the Covenant" ends as it began, with a solemn warning against idolatry. (See <a href="/exodus/20-23.htm">Exodus 20:23</a>.) "Thou shalt make no covenant with them <span class="accented">nor with their gods</span>." Thou shalt not even suffer them to dwell side by side with thee in the land, on peaceable terms, with their own laws and religion, lest thou be ensnared thereby, and led to worship their idols and join in their unhallowed rites (ver. 33). The after history of the people of Israel shows the need of the warning. From the exodus to the captivity, every idolatry with which they came into close contact proved a sore temptation to them. As the author of Kings observes of the Ten Tribes" - The children of Israel did secretly those things which were not right against the Lord their God, and they built them high places in all their cities... And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree; and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the Lord carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger; for they served idols, whereof the Lord had said unto them, "Ye shall not do this thing" (<a href="/2_kings/17-9.htm">2 Kings 17:9-12</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt make no covenant with them</span>. See below, <a href="/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-15</a>. According to the forms usual at the time, a treaty of peace would have contained an acknowledgment of the gods of either nation, and words in honour of them. (See the "Treaty of Rameses II. with the Hittites," given in the <span class="accented">Records of the Past</span>, vol. 4. pp. 27-32.) This would have been equivalent to "making a covenant with their gods." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/23-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You shall make</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;i&#7733;&#183;r&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3772.htm">Strong's 3772: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut, to destroy, consume, to covenant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">no</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">covenant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;r&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1285.htm">Strong's 1285: </a> </span><span class="str2">A covenant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1462;&#1435;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">or with their gods.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#234;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">OT Law: Exodus 23:32 You shall make no covenant with them (Exo.
