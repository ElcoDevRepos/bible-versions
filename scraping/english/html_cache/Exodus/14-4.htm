The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a recurring theme in Exodus, emphasizing God's power and purpose. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the heart was seen as the center of will and decision-making. God's hardening of Pharaoh's heart demonstrates His authority over human decisions, aligning with His divine plan. This act also serves as a judgment against Pharaoh's persistent rebellion and pride, showcasing God's justice.<p><b>so that he will pursue them.</b><br>Pharaoh's pursuit of the Israelites is a pivotal moment in the Exodus narrative. Historically, the Egyptians were a dominant power, and their pursuit reflects their desire to maintain control over their former slaves. This pursuit sets the stage for the miraculous deliverance at the Red Sea, highlighting God's protection and deliverance of His people. Theologically, it underscores the theme of God leading His people into situations where His power and glory can be displayed.<p><b>But I will gain honor by means of Pharaoh and all his army,</b><br>God's intention to gain honor through Pharaoh and his army reveals His desire to demonstrate His supremacy over the gods of Egypt and the might of its military. In the ancient world, military power was often associated with divine favor. By defeating Pharaoh's army, God shows that He alone is the true God, worthy of honor and reverence. This act foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over all earthly powers, a theme echoed throughout Scripture.<p><b>and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>This statement emphasizes God's purpose in the events of the Exodus: to reveal His identity and power to the Egyptians. The knowledge of the LORD is a recurring biblical theme, often associated with His acts of judgment and salvation. The plagues and the parting of the Red Sea serve as signs to the Egyptians, challenging their polytheistic beliefs and demonstrating the LORD's uniqueness. This revelation is not only for the Israelites but also for the surrounding nations, pointing to God's universal sovereignty.<p><b>So this is what the Israelites did.</b><br>The Israelites' obedience in following God's instructions is crucial to the narrative. Their actions reflect trust in God's plan and leadership through Moses. This obedience is a model for faith and reliance on God, even in seemingly impossible situations. The Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land is a type of the Christian journey of faith, where believers are called to trust and follow God through life's challenges, assured of His deliverance and ultimate victory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart God hardens to pursue

7:3; 9:12), showing His absolute sovereignty over rulers (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>) and fulfilling His purpose (<a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; This action is judicial: Pharaoh has already resisted God through the plagues; the hardening confirms him in the path he has chosen (<a href="/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15, 32</a>).<p>&#8226; The hardening serves a larger plan&#8212;displaying God&#8217;s power and rescuing Israel&#8212;just as later judgments on Canaanite kings served God&#8217;s redemptive aim (<a href="/joshua/11-20.htm">Joshua

human resolve, yet God is directing events (<a href="/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The pursuit places Israel in an impossible position, hemmed in by desert and sea (14:2-3), so deliverance will clearly be divine (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7-11</a> recalls how the Egyptians &#8220;pursued&#8221;

(14:17)&#8212;is deliberately drawn out so that its defeat magnifies God&#8217;s supremacy (<a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Even hostile powers become instruments for proclaiming His renown (<a href="/ezekiel/28-22.htm">Ezekiel 28:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and the Egyptians will know that I am

when I stretch out My hand&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>; 10:2; 14:18).<p>&#8226; Judgment has an evangelistic edge; some Egyptians later accompany Israel (12:38), and Rahab&#8217;s confession shows the Red Sea story traveled far (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Every display of God&#8217;s power points nations to His unique identity (<a href="/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the Israelites did this</b><p>&#8220;So this is what the Israelites

(14:31).<p>&#8226; Obedience in crisis models the pattern later taught by Jesus: hearing and doing God&#8217;s commands secures life (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a> reveals God&#8217;s purposeful orchestration of events: He hardens Pharaoh&#8217;s heart, draws Egypt into pursuit, and then
