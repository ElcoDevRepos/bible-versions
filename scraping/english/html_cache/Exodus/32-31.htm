This reflects the biblical theme of mediation, where a chosen leader stands between God and His people. Moses' actions here prefigure the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The act of returning to the LORD also highlights the importance of seeking divine guidance and forgiveness after sin.<p><b>&#8220;Oh, what a great sin these people have committed!</b><br>The phrase acknowledges the gravity of the Israelites' actions. The "great sin" refers to the idolatry committed by the people when they made and worshiped the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>). This sin is significant because it violates the first two commandments given by God (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). The acknowledgment of sin is a crucial step in the process of repentance and restoration, a theme that runs throughout Scripture (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<p><b>They have made gods of gold for themselves.</b><br>This phrase highlights the specific nature of the Israelites' sin: idolatry. The making of "gods of gold" is a direct affront to the monotheistic worship of Yahweh, who had delivered them from Egypt. The use of gold, a valuable material, underscores the misplaced priorities of the people, valuing material wealth over spiritual fidelity. This act of idolatry is a recurring issue in Israel's history, leading to various judgments and calls for repentance (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). It also serves as a warning against the dangers of materialism and the worship of created things rather than the Creator (<a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt.
