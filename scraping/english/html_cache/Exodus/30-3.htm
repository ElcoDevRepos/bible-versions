Gold, being a precious metal, was often used in the tabernacle to represent purity and the glory of God. This reflects the heavenly reality, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>, where the New Jerusalem is described as being made of pure gold. The overlaying of gold also points to the value and importance of worship and sacrifice in the life of the Israelites.<p><b>the top and all the sides and horns</b><br>The altar's design, including the horns, symbolizes strength and power. Horns in biblical times were often associated with authority and might (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). The altar's horns were used for the ritual application of blood, signifying atonement and purification (<a href="/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>).
