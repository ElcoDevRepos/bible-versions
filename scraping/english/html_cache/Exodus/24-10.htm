In the context of the Old Testament, seeing God was a rare and significant event, often associated with divine revelation or covenant establishment. The "God of Israel" emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and the nation of Israel. This vision is reminiscent of other biblical encounters with God, such as Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3) and Isaiah's vision in the temple (Isaiah 6). Theologically, this moment underscores God's holiness and the privilege of being in His presence, foreshadowing the ultimate revelation of God in Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>).<p><b>Under His feet was a work like a pavement made of sapphire,</b><br>The description of the pavement as "sapphire" suggests a scene of divine majesty and purity. Sapphire, a precious stone, symbolizes beauty and value, often associated with heavenly realities. This imagery is echoed in Ezekiel's vision of God's throne, where a similar expanse is described (<a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>). The pavement under God's feet signifies His authority and the foundation of His throne, highlighting the transcendence and glory of God. In a typological sense, this can be seen as a precursor to the New Jerusalem, where the streets are made of pure gold (<a href="/revelation/21-21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>).<p><b>as clear as the sky itself.</b><br>The clarity "as the sky" conveys the purity and perfection of God's presence. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the sky was often associated with the divine realm, representing vastness and unapproachable holiness. This description emphasizes the transparency and brilliance of the divine vision, suggesting an unobstructed view of God's glory. The clear sky also symbolizes peace and order, reflecting the harmony of God's creation. This imagery connects to the New Testament, where believers are promised to see God face to face in the new creation (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>, <a href="/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and to receive the Law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron,_nadab,_and_abihu.htm">Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu</a></b><br>Aaron, the brother of Moses, and his sons, Nadab and Abihu, were part of the priestly line and were present during this divine encounter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/seventy_elders_of_israel.htm">Seventy Elders of Israel</a></b><br>Representatives of the people of Israel who accompanied Moses and Aaron to witness this theophany.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God revealed Himself to Moses and gave the Law to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/theophany.htm">Theophany</a></b><br>A visible manifestation of God to humans, in this case, described as seeing God and the sapphire pavement under His feet.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god.htm">The Holiness of God</a></b><br>The description of God&#8217;s presence with a sapphire pavement highlights His majesty and purity.

These words can scarcely mean less than that they saw with their bodily eyes some appearance of the Divine being who had summoned them to his presence for the purpose. Moses, we know, saw a "similitude of God" (<a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). Isaiah "saw the Lord sitting upon his throne "(<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>). Ezekiel saw upon the throne "the appearance of a man" (<a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>). It does not follow from <a href="/deuteronomy/4-12.htm">Deuteronomy 4:12, 15</a>, that <span class="accented">the elders</span> saw no similitude, since in that passage Moses is speaking, not to the elders, but to the people, and referring, not to what occurred at the sacrificial feast after the ratification of the covenant, but to the scene at the giving of the Ten Commandments previously (<a href="/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-18</a>). What the form was which the elders saw, we are not told; but as it had "feet," it was probably a human form. It may have been hazy, indefinite, "too dazzling bright for mortal eye" to rest upon. But it was a true "vision of God" - and, as Keil says, "a foretaste of the blessedness of the sight of God in eternity." <span class="cmt_word">There was under his feet, as it were, a paved work of a sapphire stone.</span> Rather, "and under his feet was, as it were, a work of clear sapphire." Nothing is said concerning a pavement, but only that below the feet of the figure which they saw was something, which looked as if it were made of bright blue sapphire stone, something as clear and as blue as the blue of heaven. Canon Cook supposes the actual sky to be meant; but the expression, "<span class="accented">as it were</span>, the body of heaven," or "like the very heaven," makes this impossible. A thing is not like itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/24-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and they saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1429;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yir&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
