The crossing is a pivotal moment in the Exodus narrative, symbolizing deliverance from slavery in Egypt. The "dry ground" emphasizes the supernatural intervention, as the seabed would naturally be muddy. This event is a testament to God's power and faithfulness, fulfilling His promise to deliver His people. It prefigures Christian baptism, symbolizing the passage from death to life, and is referenced in <a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>, where Paul speaks of the Israelites being "baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea."<p><b>with walls of water on their right and on their left</b><br>The imagery of "walls of water" highlights the miraculous nature of the event, as water naturally does not stand upright. This phenomenon underscores God's control over creation, reminiscent of His command over the waters in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. The walls of water also serve as a protective barrier, ensuring the safety of the Israelites as they pass through. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/psalms/77-16.htm">Psalm 77:16-20</a>, which poetically recounts the crossing. Theologically, the walls can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides a way of salvation and protection for believers. The crossing of the Red Sea is a foreshadowing of Christ's victory over sin and death, offering a path to eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the children of Israel, who were enslaved in Egypt and are now being led to freedom by Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The body of water that God miraculously parted to allow the Israelites to escape from the pursuing Egyptian army.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh's_army.htm">Pharaoh's Army</a></b><br>The Egyptian forces pursuing the Israelites, intending to bring them back into slavery.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_miracle.htm">God's Miracle</a></b><br>The divine intervention where God parts the Red Sea, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nature.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nature</a></b><br>God demonstrates His supreme power over creation by parting the Red Sea.

In the present case, the waters protected Israel on either flank--the Red Sea upon the right, the Bitter Lakes upon the left. Poetical writers, as was natural, used language still more highly metaphorical (<a href="/psalms/78-13.htm" title="He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.">Psalm 78:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-8.htm" title="And with the blast of your nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.">Exodus 15:8</a>), and spoke of the waters as "standing on an heap." Hence, some moderns have gone so far as to maintain that on this occasion the water "gave up its nature, formed with its waves a strong wall, and instead of streaming like a fluid, congealed into a hard substance" (Kalisch). But this is to turn poetry into prose, and enslave oneself to a narrow literalism. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The waters were a wall</span> - i<span class="accented">.e.</span>, a protection, a defence. Pharaoh could not attack them on either flank, on account of the two bodies of water between which their march lay. He could only come at them by following after them. The metaphor has been by some understood literally, especially on account of the expression in <a href="/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a> - "The floods stood upright as an heap;" and again that in <a href="/psalms/78-13.htm">Psalm 78:13</a> - "He made the waters to stand as an heap." But those phrases, occurring in poems, must be taken as poetical; and can scarcely have any weight in determining the meaning of "wall" here. We must ask ourselves - is there not an economy and a restraint in the exertion by God even of miraculous power? - is more used than is needed for the occasion? - and would not all that was needed at this time have been effected by such a division of the sea as we have supposed, without the fluid being converted into a solid, or having otherwise the laws of its being entirely altered. Kalisch's statement, that the word "wall" here is "not intended to convey the idea of protection, but only of hardness and solidity," seems to us the very reverse of the truth. Protection is at any rate the main idea, and any other is secondary and subordinate. <p> CHAPTER 14:23-31 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/14-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1447;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
