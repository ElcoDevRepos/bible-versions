The birth of a son in ancient Near Eastern cultures was significant, often seen as a continuation of the family line and a blessing from God. This event occurs during Moses' time in Midian, a period of preparation and transformation for his future role as the leader of the Israelites.<p><b>and Moses named him Gershom</b><br>The name "Gershom" is derived from the Hebrew root "ger," meaning "sojourner" or "foreigner." Naming in the biblical context often reflects personal experiences or divine revelations. Moses' choice of name for his son indicates his own sense of displacement and identity as a foreigner in Midian. This act of naming also foreshadows the Israelites' own experience of sojourning in Egypt and later in the wilderness.<p><b>saying, &#8220;I have become a foreigner in a foreign land.&#8221;</b><br>This statement captures Moses' feelings of alienation and exile. Having fled Egypt after killing an Egyptian, Moses finds himself in Midian, a land and culture unfamiliar to him. This experience of being a foreigner is a recurring theme in the Bible, reflecting the broader narrative of God's people living as strangers in a world that is not their ultimate home. It also prefigures the Israelites' journey and their eventual settlement in the Promised Land. Moses' experience can be seen as a type of Christ, who also lived as a foreigner in the world, bringing salvation to those who are spiritually exiled.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew by birth, raised in Pharaoh's palace, and later a fugitive in Midian.
