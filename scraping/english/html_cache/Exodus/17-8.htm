The Israelites had just experienced God's provision of water from the rock at Horeb, demonstrating His faithfulness and care. This sets the stage for the subsequent challenge they face, highlighting the ongoing journey and trials of the Israelites in the wilderness.<p><b>the Amalekites came</b><br>The Amalekites were a nomadic tribe descended from Esau's grandson Amalek. They are often depicted as perennial enemies of Israel. Their attack on the Israelites is significant as it represents the first military challenge faced by the Israelites after their exodus from Egypt. The Amalekites' hostility is seen as an embodiment of opposition to God's people, and they are later condemned in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a> for their unprovoked attack.<p><b>and attacked the Israelites</b><br>This attack was unprovoked and targeted the vulnerable, as described in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-18.htm">Deuteronomy 25:18</a>, where the Amalekites attacked those who were lagging behind. This act of aggression is seen as cowardly and treacherous. The Israelites, having just been delivered from Egypt, were not yet organized as a military force, making them susceptible to such attacks.<p><b>at Rephidim</b><br>Rephidim is a location in the Sinai Peninsula, significant as a place where the Israelites camped and experienced God's provision of water. The name Rephidim means "supports" or "rests," which is ironic given the conflict that occurs there. Geographically, it is situated between the wilderness of Sin and Mount Sinai, serving as a backdrop for God's continued guidance and protection of His people. The battle at Rephidim is a precursor to the giving of the Law at Sinai, emphasizing the need for reliance on God in both physical and spiritual battles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rephidim.htm">Rephidim</a></b><br>A location in the wilderness where the Israelites camped.

The verse sets the stage for Jehovah-Nissi&#8217;s banner of victory and teaches that God&#8217;s people should expect spiritual opposition yet rely completely on the Lord, who remains faithful from generation to generation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Then came Amalek.</span>--The Amalekites had not been previously (except in the anticipatory notice of <a href="/genesis/14-7.htm" title="And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelled in Hazezontamar.">Genesis 14:7</a>) mentioned as a nation. Their name marks them for descendants of Amalek, the grandson of Esau (<a href="/genesis/36-12.htm" title="And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.">Genesis 36:12</a>; <a href="/genesis/36-16.htm" title="Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.">Genesis 36:16</a>); and it would seem that they early became the predominant people in the Sinaitic peninsula. Balaam speaks of them as "the first of the nations" (<a href="/numbers/24-20.htm" title="And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.">Numbers 24:20</a>); and though we do lot meet with the name in the Egyptian records, yet it is probable that they were among the hostile nations whom we find constantly contending with the Egyptians upon their north-eastern frontier. Though Edomitesn they are always regarded as a distinct race, and one especially hostile to Israel (<a href="/exodus/17-16.htm" title="For he said, Because the LORD has sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.">Exodus 17:16</a>). Their present hostility was not altogether unprovoked. No doubt they regarded the Sinaitic region as their own, and as the most valuable portion of their territory, since it contained their summer and autumn pastures. During their absence in its more northern portion, where there was pasture for their flocks after the spring rains, a swarm of emigrants had occupied some of their best lands, and threatened to seize the remainder. Naturally, they would resent the occupation. They would not understand that it was only temporary. They would regard the Israelites as intruders, robbers, persons entitled to scant favour at their hands. Accordingly, they swooped upon them without mercy, attacked their rear as they were upon the march, cut off their stragglers, and slew many that were "feeble, faint, and weary" (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/25-17.htm" title="Remember what Amalek did to you by the way, when you were come forth out of Egypt;">Deuteronomy 25:17-18</a>). They then encamped in their neighbourhood, with the design of renewing the struggle on the next day. It was under these circumstances that Moses had to make his arrangements. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-16.</span> - THE WAR WITH AMALEK. The Amalekites seem to have been descendants of Amalek, the grandson of Esau (<a href="/genesis/36-12.htm">Genesis 36:12</a>). They separated themselves off from the other Edomites at an early date, and became the predominant tribe in the more northern parts of the Sinaitic peninsula, claiming and exercising a sovereignty over the whole of the desert country between the borders of Palestine and Egypt. We do not find the name Amalek in the Egyptian records; but the people are probably represented by the Mentu, with whom so many of the early Egyptian kings contended. The Pharaohs dispossessed them of the north-western portion of the mountain region; but they probably claimed the suzerainty of the central hills and valleys, which the Egyptians never occupied; and on these they no doubt set a high value as affording water and pasture for their flocks during the height of summer. When the Israelites pressed forward into these parts, the Amale-kites, in spite of the fact that they were a kindred race, determined on giving them battle. They began by "insidiously attacking the rear of the Hebrew army, when it was exhausted and weary" (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-18.htm">Deuteronomy 25:18</a>). I-laving cut off many stragglers, they attacked the main body at Rephidim, in the Wady-Feiran, and fought the long battle which the text describes (vers. 10-13). The result was the complete discomfiture of the assailants, who thenceforth avoided all contact with Israel until attacked in their turn at the southern frontier of Canaan, when, in conjunction with the Canaanites, they were victorious (<a href="/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>). A bitter and long continued enmity followed. Amalek, "the first of the nations" to attack Israel (Exodus 24:20), was pursued with unrelenting hostility (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>), defeated repeatedly by Saul and David (<a href="/1_samuel/14-48.htm">1 Samuel 14:48</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-7.htm">1 Samuel 15:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-17.htm">1 Samuel 30:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>); the last remnant of the nation being finally destroyed by the Simeonites in the reign of king Hezekiah, as related by the author of Chronicles (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-41.htm">1 Chronicles 4:41-43</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">Then came Amalek</span>.

They would hear of the threatened occupation of their precious summer pastures by the vast host of the Hebrews, and would seek to prevent it by blocking the way. Hence they are said to have "come" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to have marched into a position where they were not previously, though it was one situated within their country.
