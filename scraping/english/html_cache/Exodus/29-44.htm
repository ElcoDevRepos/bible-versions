The consecration of the Tent of Meeting and the altar signifies setting them apart for holy purposes. This act of consecration involved anointing with oil and sacrifices, symbolizing purification and dedication to God. The altar, central to the sacrificial system, was where offerings were made to atone for sin and express worship. This consecration underscores the holiness required for anything associated with God's presence, reflecting the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the need for purity in worship (<a href="/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10-11</a>).<p><b>and I will consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve Me as priests</b><br>Aaron and his sons were chosen by God to serve as priests, mediating between God and the people. Their consecration involved a detailed ritual, including washing, clothing in sacred garments, anointing, and sacrifices (<a href="/exodus/29.htm">Exodus 29:1-9</a>). This priesthood was a type of the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who mediates a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The priesthood of Aaron and his sons highlights the necessity of a divinely appointed mediator to approach God, a role perfectly fulfilled in Christ. The consecration also emphasizes the importance of divine calling and preparation for those who serve in spiritual leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>This was a sacred space where God met with Moses and the Israelites.

See <a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>, where we learn that on the first occasion of Aaron's offering sacrifice upon the brazen altar, "there came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat." Thus the altar had its miraculous sanctification, as well as the tabernacle, and was not merely consecrated by human instrumentality. <span class="cmt_word">I will sanctify also both Aaron and his</span> <span class="cmt_word">sons.</span> It would seem to follow, by parity of reasoning, that here also something more is intended than had been accomplished by the rites of consecration. The verb is in the future - "I will sanctify" - and must allude to something which has not yet taken place. Probably, sanctification of the spirit is intended - that Divine influence upon the heart which alone makes men really and truly "holy." (Compare <a href="/leviticus/21-8.htm">Leviticus 21:8, 15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/22-9.htm">Leviticus 22:9, 16</a>.) But in this case the promise must have been conditional.
