The collective response signifies a communal commitment to the covenant being established. In the context of the ancient Near East, communal decisions were often made in unison, reflecting a shared identity and purpose. This unity is significant as it contrasts with later instances of disobedience and division among the Israelites.<p><b>&#8220;We will do everything that the LORD has spoken.&#8221;</b><br>The people's declaration of obedience is a pivotal moment in the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This commitment echoes the covenantal language found in other parts of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/5-27.htm">Deuteronomy 5:27</a>, where the people express a willingness to listen and obey God's commands. The phrase foreshadows the giving of the Ten Commandments and the Law, which will define Israel's identity and relationship with God. It also reflects a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfills the law and embodies obedience to the Father.<p><b>So Moses brought their words back to the LORD.</b><br>Moses acts as the mediator between God and the people, a role that is central throughout the Exodus narrative. This mediation is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The act of bringing the people's words to God signifies the establishment of a formal covenant, akin to ancient suzerain-vassal treaties where a mediator would communicate between the sovereign and the subjects. Moses' role underscores the importance of intercession and communication in the relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, who are now a large nation, recently freed from slavery in Egypt.
