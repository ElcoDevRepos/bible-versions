In the context of the Old Testament, such direct communication was rare and highlights Moses' special role as a prophet and leader. The term "face to face" is metaphorical, as other scriptures (e.g., <a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>) clarify that no one can see God's face and live. This expression emphasizes the clarity and directness of God's communication with Moses, unlike the dreams and visions given to other prophets (<a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>).<p><b>as a man speaks to his friend</b><br>This comparison underscores the closeness and familiarity of the relationship between God and Moses. In ancient Near Eastern culture, friendship implied loyalty, trust, and mutual respect. This phrase suggests that Moses had a unique standing with God, characterized by open and honest dialogue. It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers being called friends of God through Christ (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>).<p><b>Then Moses would return to the camp</b><br>After these divine encounters, Moses would go back to the Israelite camp, indicating his role as a mediator between God and the people. This movement between the tent of meeting and the camp symbolizes Moses' dual role as both a spiritual leader and a practical leader of the people. It reflects the ongoing need for guidance and leadership among the Israelites during their wilderness journey.<p><b>but his young assistant Joshua son of Nun would not leave the tent</b><br>Joshua's presence in the tent signifies his role as Moses' apprentice and future leader of Israel. His dedication and constant presence in the tent of meeting suggest his commitment to God and his preparation for leadership. Joshua's role here foreshadows his eventual succession of Moses and his leadership in the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/1.htm">Joshua 1:1-9</a>).
