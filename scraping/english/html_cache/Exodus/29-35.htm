The priesthood is a central theme in the Old Testament, with Aaron and his descendants serving as the first high priests. This establishes the Levitical priesthood, which plays a crucial role in Israel's worship and sacrificial system. The priesthood is a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>.<p><b>based on all that I have commanded you</b><br>This emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's commands.
