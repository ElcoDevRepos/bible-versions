The concept of firstfruits is deeply rooted in the agricultural society of ancient Israel, where the first yield of the harvest was seen as a sign of God's blessing. Offering the firstfruits was an act of faith, trusting that God would provide for the rest of the harvest. This practice is connected to the broader biblical theme of giving God the first and best, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>, which encourages honoring the Lord with one's wealth and the firstfruits of all produce. The "house of the LORD" refers to the tabernacle, and later the temple, as the central place of worship and sacrifice. This offering was a way to support the Levitical priesthood and maintain the worship system established by God. Theologically, the firstfruits can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the "firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep" in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>, symbolizing His resurrection as the first of many to come.<p><b>You must not cook a young goat in its mother&#8217;s milk.</b><br>This prohibition is one of the more enigmatic commands in the Old Testament. It is repeated in <a href="/exodus/34-26.htm">Exodus 34:26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>, indicating its importance. Historically, some scholars suggest this command was given to prevent Israelites from adopting pagan Canaanite rituals, as cooking a young goat in its mother's milk may have been a fertility rite. Culturally, this command underscores the principle of separation and holiness that God required of His people, distinguishing them from surrounding nations. Theologically, it reflects a sensitivity to the natural order and the nurturing relationship between a mother and her offspring, which should not be violated. This command has also been foundational in Jewish dietary laws, leading to the separation of meat and dairy in kosher practices. While the specific reason for this command is not explicitly stated, it serves as a reminder of the broader call to holiness and obedience to God's instructions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the law given by God through Moses.

To support this theory it is suggested that the command has reference to a superstitious practice customary at the close of the harvest--a kid being then boiled in its mother's milk with magic rites, and the milk used to sprinkle plantations, fields, and gardens, in order to render them more productive the next year. But <a href="/deuteronomy/14-21.htm" title="You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you shall give it to the stranger that is in your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to an alien: for you are an holy people to the LORD your God. You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>, which attaches the precept to a list of unclean meats, is sufficient to show that the kid spoken of was boiled to be eaten. The best explanation of the passage is that of Bochart (<span class= "ital">Hierozoic. </span>pt. 1, bk. 2, Exo. 52), that there was a sort of cruelty in making the milk of the mother, intended for the kid's sustenance, the means of its destruction. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="accented">Law of first-fruits</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The first of the first-fruits</span> may mean either "the best of the first-fruits" (see <a href="/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>), or "the very first of each kind that is ripe" (<span class="accented">ib</span>, verse 13).

The outline of law put before the Israelites in the "Book of the Covenant" terminated with this remarkable prohibition. Its importance is shown - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> By its place here; and <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> By its being thrice repeated in the law of Moses (see <a href="/exodus/34-26.htm">Exodus 34:26</a>; and <a href="/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>). Various explanations have been given of it; but none is saris-factory, except that which views it as "a protest against cruelty, and outraging the order of nature," more especially that peculiarly sacred portion of nature's order, the tender relation between parent and child, mother and suckling. No doubt the practice existed. Kids were thought to be most palatable when boiled in milk; and the mother's milk was frequently the readiest to obtain. But in this way the mother was made a sort of accomplice in the death of her child, which men were induced to kill on account of the flavour that her milk gave it.
