The favor granted by the LORD is reminiscent of earlier biblical narratives where God influences the hearts of others, such as in <a href="/genesis/39-21.htm">Genesis 39:21</a>, where Joseph finds favor in the eyes of the prison warden. Theologically, this demonstrates God's sovereignty and His ability to fulfill His promises to His people, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>, where God foretells that the Israelites will leave Egypt with great possessions. The favor in the sight of the Egyptians also reflects a reversal of the Israelites' previous status as slaves, showcasing God's power to change circumstances.<p><b>that they granted their request</b><br>The Israelites' request refers to the asking of silver, gold, and clothing from the Egyptians, as instructed by God in <a href="/exodus/3-21.htm">Exodus 3:21-22</a>. This act of requesting and receiving wealth can be seen as a form of reparations for the years of slavery and oppression endured by the Israelites. It also fulfills God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would leave their place of bondage with great wealth. The Egyptians' willingness to comply may be attributed to the fear and awe instilled by the plagues, particularly the final plague, which demonstrated the power of the God of Israel.<p><b>In this way they plundered the Egyptians</b><br>The term "plundered" is significant as it conveys the idea of a victorious outcome, typically associated with warfare. However, in this context, it is achieved without violence, underscoring the miraculous nature of the event. This act of plundering fulfills God's promise and serves as a type of Christ, who, through His death and resurrection, disarmed the powers and authorities, making a public spectacle of them (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>). Theologically, it also prefigures the ultimate victory of God's people over their oppressors and the eventual inheritance of the promised land. Historically, this transfer of wealth from Egypt to Israel sets the stage for the construction of the Tabernacle, as the materials provided by the Egyptians would later be used for this purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who orchestrates the events leading to the Israelites' liberation from Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, who are enslaved in Egypt and are about to be delivered by God's mighty hand.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt, who are compelled by God to show favor to the Israelites, allowing them to leave with wealth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from slavery, though not directly mentioned in this verse, he is central to the Exodus account.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The event of the Israelites' departure from Egypt, marking a significant moment of liberation and fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_provision.htm">God's Sovereignty and Provision</a></b><br>God is in control of all circumstances and can provide for His people in unexpected ways.
