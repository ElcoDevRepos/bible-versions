Pharaoh had decreed that all Hebrew male infants be killed (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>). Moses' mother, Jochebed, hid him for three months, demonstrating her faith and courage. This act of defiance against Pharaoh's edict highlights the tension between obeying God and human authority, a theme echoed in <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>.<p><b>she got him a papyrus basket</b><br>The use of a papyrus basket is significant. Papyrus was a common material in Egypt, used for making boats, baskets, and writing material. The Hebrew word for "basket" here is "tevah," the same word used for Noah's ark (<a href="/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14</a>). This parallel suggests a theme of salvation and deliverance, as both Noah and Moses were preserved through water.<p><b>and coated it with tar and pitch</b><br>The waterproofing of the basket with tar and pitch ensured its buoyancy and protection against the waters of the Nile. This mirrors the construction of Noah's ark, which was also coated with pitch (<a href="/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14</a>). The use of these materials signifies God's provision and care in ensuring the safety of His chosen deliverer.<p><b>Then she placed the child in the basket</b><br>Jochebed's act of placing Moses in the basket was an act of faith, entrusting her child to God's providence. This moment foreshadows the future deliverance of Israel through Moses, as well as the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who was also placed in a humble setting at birth (<a href="/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>).<p><b>and set it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile</b><br>The Nile River was central to Egyptian life and culture, often associated with fertility and sustenance. By setting the basket among the reeds, Jochebed strategically placed Moses in a location where he might be discovered by someone who could protect him. This act of faith and hope is reminiscent of God's providential care, as seen in the story of Joseph, who was also placed in a foreign environment for a greater purpose (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jochebed.htm">Jochebed</a></b><br>The mother of Moses, who took a courageous step to protect her son by placing him in a basket on the Nile River.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The infant who would grow up to become the leader of the Israelites and deliver them from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nile_river.htm">The Nile River</a></b><br>A significant geographical location in Egypt, serving as the setting for Moses' early life and a symbol of both danger and deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/papyrus_basket.htm">Papyrus Basket</a></b><br>The vessel used by Jochebed to save Moses, symbolizing faith and divine protection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/reeds.htm">Reeds</a></b><br>The natural environment along the Nile where Moses was placed, providing concealment and safety.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Jochebed's actions demonstrate a profound trust in God, encouraging believers to act in faith even in dire circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection.htm">Divine Protection</a></b><br>The account illustrates God's providence and protection over His chosen ones, reminding us of His care in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courageous_parenting.htm">Courageous Parenting</a></b><br>Jochebed's bravery serves as an example for parents to protect and nurture their children in faith, trusting God with their future.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_deliverance.htm">Symbolism of Deliverance</a></b><br>The basket in the Nile is a precursor to the deliverance of Israel, symbolizing hope and salvation amidst peril.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The placement of Moses in the Nile and his subsequent discovery by Pharaoh's daughter highlight God's sovereign plan and timing.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_2_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 2:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_2_3_Faith_in_God_s_care.htm">How does Exodus 2:3 demonstrate faith in God's protection and provision?

Mineral pitch, though not a product of Egypt, was imported into the country from Mesopotamia, and was largely used for embalming (Brugsch, <span class= "ital">History of Egypt, </span>vol. i. p. 361).<p><span class= "bld">In the flags.</span>--A rank aquatic vegetation abounds on the Lower Nile, and in all the back-waters and marshy tracts connected with it. Jochebed placed her child "in the flags," that the ark might not float away down the river, and so be lost to her sight. The word used for "flag"--<span class= "ital">suph</span>--seems to be a Hebraised form of <span class= "ital">tufi, </span>a common Egyptian word, having this sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She took for him an ark of bulrushes</span>. The words translated "ark" and "bulrushes" are both of Egyptian origin, the former corresponding to the ordinary word for "chest," which is feb, <span class="accented">teba</span>, or tebat, and the latter corresponding to the Egyptian <span class="accented">kam</span>, which is the same in Coptic, and designates the papyrus plant. This is a strong-growing rush, with a triangular stem, which attains the height of from 10 to 15 feet. The Egyptian paper was made from its pith. The rush itself was used for various purposes - among others for boat-building (Plin. 'H. N.' 6:22; 7:16; Theophrast, 4:9; Pint. 'De Isid. et Osir.' &sect; 18, etc.), as appears from the monuments. It would be a very good material for the sort of purpose to which Jochebed applied it. <span class="cmt_word">She daubed it with slime and with pitch</span>. The word translated "slime" is the same as that used in <a href="/genesis/11-3.htm">Genesis 11:3</a>, which is generally thought to mean "mineral pitch" or "bitumen." According to Strabo and Dioderus, that material was largely used by the Egyptians for the embalming of corpses, and was imported into Egypt from Palestine. Boats are sometimes covered with it externally at the present day (Ker Porter, Travels, vol. 2. p. 260; Layard,'Nineveh and its Remains,' pt. 2. ch. 5.); but Jochebed seems to have used vegetable pitch- the ordinary pitch of commerce - for the purpose. Here again the Hebrew word is taken from the Egyptian. <span class="cmt_word">She laid it in the flags</span>. "Suph," the word translated "flags," is a modification of the Egyptian <span class="accented">tuff</span>, which has that meaning.
