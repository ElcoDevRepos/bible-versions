It is a day set apart for rest and worship, signifying God's provision and sovereignty. The Sabbath is a covenant sign between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>), emphasizing trust in God's provision. It foreshadows the rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>), who offers spiritual rest to believers.<p><b>that is why on the sixth day He will give you bread for two days.</b><br>This provision of manna for two days on the sixth day underscores God's miraculous provision and care for His people. It required faith and obedience from the Israelites, as they had to trust that the manna would not spoil overnight, unlike on other days (<a href="/exodus/16-20.htm">Exodus 16:20, 24</a>). This prefigures Christ as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), who provides spiritual sustenance and fulfillment.<p><b>On the seventh day, everyone must stay where he is;</b><br>The command to remain in place on the Sabbath highlights the importance of rest and reflection. It was a time to cease from labor and focus on God, reinforcing the principle of dependence on Him. This practice distinguished Israel from surrounding nations and served as a reminder of their unique relationship with God.<p><b>no one may leave his place.&#8221;</b><br>This restriction ensured that the Sabbath was observed as a day of rest and not just another day of activity. It was a practical measure to prevent work and encourage contemplation and worship. The Sabbath rest is a type of the eternal rest promised to believers, pointing to the ultimate rest in God's presence (<a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who communicates God's laws and instructions to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_sin.htm">The Wilderness of Sin</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites are currently encamped and where God provides manna.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sabbath.htm">The Sabbath</a></b><br>A day of rest instituted by God, signifying a covenant between Him and His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/manna.htm">Manna</a></b><br>The miraculous bread from heaven provided by God to sustain the Israelites in the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_gift_of_rest.htm">The Gift of Rest</a></b><br>The Sabbath is a divine gift, emphasizing the importance of rest and reliance on God's provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Observing the Sabbath requires trust and obedience, reflecting our faith in God's instructions and His care for us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/provision_and_trust.htm">Provision and Trust</a></b><br>God's provision of manna teaches us to trust Him for our daily needs and to recognize His sovereignty over our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_worship.htm">Community and Worship</a></b><br>The Sabbath fosters community and worship, as it is a time set apart for focusing on God and His goodness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_rest_in_christ.htm">Spiritual Rest in Christ</a></b><br>The Sabbath points to the ultimate rest found in Jesus, encouraging believers to find peace and rest in Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_16_29_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 16:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_16_29_Sabbath_rest_s_importance.htm">How does Exodus 16:29 emphasize the importance of observing the Sabbath rest today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Sabbath_show_God_s_provision.htm">What does "the LORD has given you the Sabbath" reveal about God's provision?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Exodus_16_29_s_rest_today.htm">How can we apply the principle of rest from Exodus 16:29 in our lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Exodus_16_29_link_to_Sabbath_law.htm">In what ways does Exodus 16:29 connect to the Fourth Commandment in Exodus 20:8-11?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Sabbath_How_does_it_deepen_bonds.htm">How does observing the Sabbath strengthen our relationship with God and others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_16_29_s_role_in_Sabbath_today.htm">How does Exodus 16:29 support the observance of the Sabbath in modern Christianity?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_rest_in_Exodus_16_29.htm">Why did God emphasize rest in Exodus 16:29, and how does it apply today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Exodus_16_29_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Exodus 16:29?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_bread_of_the_presence.htm">What is the Bread of the Presence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_did_israelites_survive_without_bread.htm">(Deut 29:6) If the Israelites lacked basic provisions like bread and wine, how did they realistically survive in the harsh desert environment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_do_many_worship_on_sunday,_not_sabbath.htm">Exodus 31:16-17 -

But generally it was held that the "place" intended was the camp, which the Israelites were forbidden to quit; and hence was derived the idea of the "sabbath day's journey," which was reckoned at six stadia - the supposed distance of the furthest bounds of the camp from its centre. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/16-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Understand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has given</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7791;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you the Sabbath;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;ab&#183;b&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
