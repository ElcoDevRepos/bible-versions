In the biblical context, the hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a recurring theme in the Exodus narrative, illustrating the struggle between divine will and human obstinacy. Theologically, it reflects the tension between God's sovereignty and human free will. The hardening of the heart is also seen as a judgment from God, as mentioned in <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17-18</a>, where Paul discusses God's purpose in raising Pharaoh to demonstrate His power.<p><b>this time as well</b><br>This suggests a pattern of behavior, as Pharaoh had previously hardened his heart during earlier plagues. The repetition emphasizes Pharaoh's persistent rebellion against God. Historically, the plagues were a direct challenge to the Egyptian pantheon, each plague targeting specific deities. Pharaoh's repeated refusal to heed God's command highlights the futility of resisting divine authority and serves as a warning against the dangers of pride and stubbornness.<p><b>and he would not let the people go</b><br>This phrase underscores Pharaoh's refusal to release the Israelites, despite the mounting pressure from the plagues. In the broader narrative, this refusal sets the stage for the eventual deliverance of the Israelites, a pivotal event in salvation history. Theologically, it prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who frees humanity from the bondage of sin. The Exodus story is often seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, with Moses as a foreshadowing of Christ as the deliverer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who repeatedly refuses to release the Israelites from slavery, despite witnessing God's power through the plagues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to demand the release of the Israelites and lead them out of Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are enslaved in Egypt and are the people God intends to deliver.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved and where God demonstrates His power through the plagues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plagues.htm">The Plagues</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments sent by God to persuade Pharaoh to release the Israelites, with the hardening of Pharaoh's heart being a recurring theme.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_a_hardened_heart.htm">The Danger of a Hardened Heart</a></b><br>Pharaoh's repeated hardening of his heart serves as a warning against resisting God's will.

Previous encounters have already shown his stubborn disposition (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>; 7:13).<p>&#8211; By naming Pharaoh first, Scripture intentionally fixes responsibility on a real historical figure, underscoring that the coming judgment is neither random nor unfair.<p>&#8211; Earlier signs and wonders had demonstrated God&#8217;s supremacy (<a href="/exodus/7-17.htm">Exodus 7:17</a>; 8:10). Yet Pharaoh&#8217;s personal response remains unchanged, emphasizing the moral accountability each leader&#8212;and by extension each person&#8212;bears before God (<a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hardened His Heart</b><p>&#8211; To &#8220;harden&#8221; is a deliberate act of resistance. Here the text states plainly that Pharaoh himself hardened his own heart, echoing earlier self-hardening moments (<a href="/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15</a>) and differing from occasions where God judicially confirms Pharaoh&#8217;s choice (<a href="/exodus/9-12.htm">Exodus 9:12</a>).<p>&#8211; This shows the coexistence of human responsibility and divine sovereignty. Pharaoh exercises real willful defiance while God remains fully in control of the unfolding plan (<a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17-18</a>).<p>&#8211; A hardened heart dulls spiritual perception, making a person less responsive to further truth (<a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-8</a>). Pharaoh&#8217;s example warns how repeated refusals can solidify into entrenched rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This Time as Well</b><p>&#8211; The phrase highlights a pattern, not an isolated lapse. Each plague is a fresh opportunity for repentance (<a href="/exodus/8-8.htm">Exodus 8:8-10, 25</a>-28). Each refusal compounds guilt.<p>&#8211; Persistence in sin often follows a downward spiral: initial resistance becomes habitual, then intractable (<a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s patience is evident; He sends sign after sign, giving space for change (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). Pharaoh&#8217;s &#8220;this time as well&#8221; underscores that divine patience, if spurned, magnifies judgment (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He Would Not Let the People Go</b><p>&#8211; The immediate issue is Israel&#8217;s freedom to worship the LORD in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>; 5:1).
