The two signs refer to the previous miracles God instructed Moses to perform: turning his staff into a serpent and making his hand leprous and then healed. These signs were meant to authenticate Moses' divine commission. The Israelites' potential disbelief reflects a recurring theme of doubt and testing God, seen throughout their wilderness journey (e.g., <a href="/exodus/17-2.htm">Exodus 17:2-7</a>). This skepticism also foreshadows the persistent unbelief that Jesus encountered during His ministry (<a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37</a>).<p><b>take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground</b><br>The Nile River was central to Egyptian life and economy, symbolizing fertility and sustenance. By instructing Moses to take water from the Nile, God was directly challenging the Egyptian deities associated with the river, such as Hapi, the god of the Nile. This act would demonstrate God's supremacy over Egyptian gods and foreshadow the plagues, particularly the first plague where the Nile turned to blood (<a href="/exodus/7-14.htm">Exodus 7:14-24</a>). The dry ground signifies the land of Egypt, which would be affected by God's judgment.<p><b>Then the water you take from the Nile will become blood on the ground.</b><br>This transformation of water into blood is a precursor to the first plague and serves as a sign of judgment. Blood in the Bible often symbolizes life (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>) and judgment (<a href="/revelation/16-3.htm">Revelation 16:3-4</a>). This miracle prefigures the ultimate judgment and redemption through the blood of Christ, who turned water into wine at Cana (<a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>), symbolizing the new covenant. The act of turning water into blood on the ground also signifies the impending judgment on Egypt, a nation that had oppressed God's people, and serves as a warning of the consequences of unbelief and disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

The pattern of disbelief despite clear evidence starts here.<p>- This clause underscores divine foreknowledge and patience&#8212;He never leaves His people without a credible witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or listen to your voice</b><p>- The &#8220;voice&#8221; refers to Moses&#8217; spoken testimony accompanying the signs. <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a> reminds us, &#8220;Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ&#8221;.<p>- When people refuse both visible signs and audible truth, they stand doubly accountable (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-19.htm">Deuteronomy 18:19</a>; <a href="/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>).<p>- God affirms Moses&#8217; authority: rejecting him equals rejecting the One who sent him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>take some water from the Nile</b><p>- The Nile was Egypt&#8217;s lifeline&#8212;economically, agriculturally, and religiously (<a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a> speaks of Pharaoh boasting, &#8220;The Nile is mine; I made it for myself,&#8221;).<p>- By using Nile water, God targets the very symbol of Egyptian strength, proving His supremacy over their idols.<p>- This step is simple and ordinary&#8212;just &#8220;some water&#8221;&#8212;showing that the Lord uses common elements to display uncommon power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>pour it on the dry ground</b><p>- Obedience involves a visible act of faith. Moses must lift the water from its source and publicly spill it onto ground that lacks life-giving moisture.<p>- The scene echoes later demonstrations, like Elijah soaking the altar before God answered with fire (<a href="/1_kings/18-33.htm">1 Kings 18:33&#8211;38</a>).<p>- God works where human ability has no sway; dry earth can&#8217;t transform water, but He can.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then the water you take from the Nile</b><p>- The repetition stresses personal participation: &#8220;you take.&#8221; Miracles often require the servant&#8217;s hand to engage (<a href="/john/2-7.htm">John 2:7</a>, servants filling jars).<p>- It is not new water; it is the same water Moses collected.

By turning Egypt&#8217;s proud river into blood on dry soil, the Lord exposes false security, demonstrates His total authority, and previews the plagues to come. The passage reminds us that God supplies sufficient evidence for faith, holds people responsible for their response, and ultimately points every miracle toward the greater redemption fulfilled in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Shall become blood.</span>--The verb is repeated in the Hebrew, which intensifies the assertion. The English equivalent of the phrase used would be, "shall assuredly become." The signs were, no doubt, selected primarily for facility of exhibition; but they may also have been intended to be significant. The change of a rod into a serpent showed that a feeble implement might become a power to chastise and to destroy. That of a healthy into a leprous hand, and the reverse, indicated that Moses's mission was both to punish and to save; while the change of water into blood suggested--albeit vaguely--the conversion of that peace and prosperity, which Egypt was enjoying, into calamity, suffering, and bloodshed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If they will not believe also</span>. "<span class="accented">Even"</span> would be a better translation than <span class="cmt_word">"also." The river</span> is of course "the Nile." See the comment on Exodus 2:3. Of the three signs given, the first would probably convince all those who were religious, well-disposed, and fair-minded; the second, acting upon their fears, would move all but the desperately wicked, who despised Jehovah and put their trust in the gods of the Egyptians (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7, 8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3, 8</a>, etc.). The third sign was for these last, who would regard the Nile as a great divinity, and would see in the conversion of Nile water into blood a significant indication that the God who had commissioned Moses was greater than any Egyptian one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/4-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">believe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1441;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;m&#238;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_539.htm">Strong's 539: </a> </span><span class="str2">To confirm, support</span><br /><br /><span class="word">even</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(gam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">these</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
