His declaration signifies the recognition of God's power and deliverance. Jethro's role as a priest suggests he was a spiritual leader, and his acknowledgment of the LORD highlights the universal recognition of God's sovereignty beyond Israel. This moment also reflects the importance of testimony and witness in the ancient Near Eastern culture, where verbal declarations were significant.<p><b>Blessed be the LORD</b><br>The phrase "Blessed be the LORD" is a common expression of praise and gratitude found throughout the Old Testament. It acknowledges God's supreme authority and benevolence. This blessing is significant as it comes from a non-Israelite, indicating the LORD's influence and reputation among other nations. It echoes similar blessings found in <a href="/genesis/14-20.htm">Genesis 14:20</a> and <a href="/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a>, where God's intervention and provision are celebrated.<p><b>who has delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh</b><br>This phrase highlights God's miraculous intervention in freeing the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. The "hand" symbolizes power and control, and God's deliverance demonstrates His superiority over the might of Egypt and its ruler, Pharaoh. This deliverance is a central theme in the Exodus narrative, showcasing God's faithfulness to His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It also prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who frees humanity from the bondage of sin.<p><b>and who has delivered the people from the hand of the Egyptians</b><br>Reiterating the deliverance emphasizes the collective salvation of the Israelites, not just Moses. It underscores the communal aspect of God's salvation plan, which is a recurring theme in Scripture. This deliverance is a foundational event for the identity of Israel as God's chosen people and serves as a type of the greater deliverance through Christ, as seen in the New Testament. The repeated mention of deliverance from the Egyptians reinforces the completeness and totality of God's saving power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jethro.htm">Jethro</a></b><br>Moses' father-in-law, a priest of Midian, who visits Moses in the wilderness and acknowledges God's deliverance of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, who delivered Israel from Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The oppressors of the Israelites, from whom God delivered His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, who resisted God's command to let the Israelites go.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_god's_deliverance.htm">Recognition of God's Deliverance</a></b><br>Jethro's declaration reminds us to acknowledge and praise God for His acts of deliverance in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_to_others.htm">Witness to Others</a></b><br>Jethro, a non-Israelite, recognizes God's power, illustrating how our testimonies can impact those outside the faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_and_worship.htm">Gratitude and Worship</a></b><br>Like Jethro, we should respond to God's work with gratitude and worship, recognizing His sovereignty and grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intergenerational_faith.htm">Intergenerational Faith</a></b><br>Jethro's acknowledgment of God's deliverance encourages us to share accounts of God's faithfulness with future generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>The deliverance from Egypt demonstrates God's control over nations and rulers, reassuring us of His ultimate authority.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_18_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 18:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_18_10_God_s_deliverance_shown.htm">How does Exodus 18:10 highlight God's deliverance from oppression and evil forces?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Jethro_s_view_on_God_s_power_in_Exodus_18_10.htm">What can we learn about God's power from Jethro's acknowledgment in Exodus 18:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_18_10_and_God_s_deliverance_link.htm">How does Exodus 18:10 connect to God's deliverance in other biblical events?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Jethro_s_praise_daily.htm">How can we apply Jethro's praise in Exodus 18:10 to our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Gratitude_s_role_in_seeing_God_s_work.htm">What role does gratitude play in recognizing God's work, as seen in Exodus 18:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_18_10_God_s_deliverance_in_Israel.htm">How does Exodus 18:10 reflect God's deliverance in the context of Israel's history?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Jethro_s_blessing_God_s_power_over_nations.htm">What does Jethro's blessing in Exodus 18:10 reveal about God's power over other nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_18_10_God_s_covenant_faithfulness.htm">How does Exodus 18:10 demonstrate God's faithfulness to His covenant with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_18.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/benefits_of_studying_theology.htm">Why did God kill Egypt's firstborn children?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_did_jethro_embrace_yahweh.htm">If Jethro was a Midianite priest (Exodus 18:1), how could he seemingly embrace Yahweh while Midianites appear as enemies in other passages?

The verse calls believers today to echo that praise, remembering that the same Lord who rescued Israel still delivers His people and deserves wholehearted worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10, 11) <span class= "bld">Jethro said, Blessed be the Lord.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">Jehovah. </span>The Midianites, descendants of Abraham by Keturah, acknowledged the true God, and the Israelites could rightfully join with them in acts of worship. But it is scarcely likely that they knew God among themselves as "Jehovah." Jethro, however, understanding Moses to speak of the supreme God under that designation, adopted it from him, blessed His name, and expressed his conviction that Jehovah was exalted above all other gods. The pure monotheism of later times scarcely existed as yet. The gods of the nations were supposed to be spiritual beings, really existent, and possessed of considerable power, though very far from omnipotent.

Kalisch takes the plural pronoun to refer to Moses and Aaron; but Aaron seems not to nave been present, since he afterwards "came" (verse 12).
