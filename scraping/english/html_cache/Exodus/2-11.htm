Moses was raised as an Egyptian prince, yet he was aware of his Hebrew heritage. This moment signifies his maturity and readiness to embrace his God-given mission. <a href="/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a> notes that Moses was about 40 years old at this time, indicating a period of preparation and growth.<p><b>he went out to his own people</b><br>Moses' decision to go out to his people reflects a conscious choice to identify with the Hebrews rather than the Egyptians. This action foreshadows his future role as a leader and deliverer of Israel. <a href="/hebrews/11-24.htm">Hebrews 11:24-25</a> highlights Moses' faith in choosing to suffer with God's people rather than enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.<p><b>and observed their hard labor</b><br>The Hebrews were subjected to harsh slavery under the Egyptians, fulfilling the prophecy given to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>. Moses' observation of their suffering stirs his compassion and sense of justice, setting the stage for his later actions. This moment is pivotal in Moses' life, as it ignites his calling to deliver his people.<p><b>He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew</b><br>This incident reveals the brutal reality of the Hebrews' oppression. The Egyptian taskmasters were known for their cruelty, and this specific act of violence against a Hebrew slave highlights the systemic injustice faced by the Israelites. Moses' reaction to this event is driven by a deep sense of righteousness and foreshadows his role as a defender of his people.<p><b>one of his own people</b><br>The repetition of "his own people" emphasizes Moses' identification with the Hebrews. Despite his Egyptian upbringing, Moses' heart is aligned with the plight of the Israelites. This connection is crucial for his future leadership, as it demonstrates his solidarity and commitment to his people.

The verse reveals God&#8217;s meticulous timing, the power of covenant identity, and the stirring of righteous compassion that will propel Moses toward his God-ordained mission of deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">In those days.</span>--Notes of time are used with considerable latitude by the sacred writers. (Comp. Genesis 38; <a href="/2_kings/20-1.htm" title="In those days was Hezekiah sick to death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus said the LORD, Set your house in order; for you shall die, and not live.">2Kings 20:1</a>.) According to the tradition followed by St. Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-23.htm" title="And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers the children of Israel.">Acts 7:23</a>), Moses was "full forty years old "when he took the step here indicated. We might have expected him to have come forward sooner; but there may have been difficulties in his so doing. It is remarkable that he does not tell us anything of his life during youth or early manhood. Later tradition was full of details (Stanley, <span class= "ital">Lectures on the Jewish Church, </span>pp. 107-9), which, however, are worthless.<p><span class= "bld">He went out unto his brethren.</span>--It is probable that Pharaoh's daughter had never concealed from Moses that he was not her own child, but one of the oppressed race. She may even have allowed him to hold communication with his family. It is not, however, a mere visit that is here spoken of, but a complete withdrawal from the palace, and renunciation of his position at the court. "By faith, Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season" (<a href="/context/hebrews/11-24.htm" title="By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;">Hebrews 11:24-25</a>). It is the first sign of that strong sympathy and tender affection for his people which characterises him throughout the narrative, and culminates in the pathetic cry, "Forgive them; and if not, blot me out of thy book" (<a href="/exodus/32-32.htm" title="Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.">Exodus 32:32</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Looked on their burthens</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>examined into their condition, watched their treatment, made himself acquainted with it by personal inspection.<p><span class= "bld">He spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew.</span>--Probably a taskmaster chastising one of the labourers, whom he accused of idling. St. Stephen regards the act as one of "oppression" and "wrong-doing" (<a href="/acts/7-24.htm" title="And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:">Acts 7:24</a>). Moses must certainly have viewed it in this light, or he would not have been so moved to indignation as to kill the Egyptian. Though not a cruel nation, the Egyptians, no doubt, like other slave-drivers, occasionally abused their power, and treated the unfortunate labourers with cruelty. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-15.</span> - FIRST ATTEMPT OF MOSES TO DELIVER HIS NATION, AND ITS FAILURE. After Moses was grown up - according to the tradition accepted by St. Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a>), when he was "full forty years old" - having become by some means or other acquainted with the circumstances of his birth, which had most probably never been concealed from him, he determined to "go out" to his brethren, see with his own eyes what their treatment was, and do his best to alleviate it. He had as yet no Divine mission, no command from God to act as he did, but only a natural sympathy with his people, and a feeling perhaps that in his position he was bound, more than any one else, to make some efforts to ameliorate what must have been generally known to be a hard lot. It is scarcely likely that he had formed any definite plans. How he should act would depend on what he should see. Thus far, his conduct deserves nothing but praise. It only perhaps a little surprises us (if St. Stephen's tradition accords with fact) that he did not earlier in his life take some steps in the direction here indicated. We are bound to recollect, however, that we know very little of the restraints under which he would have been laid - whether a severe law of etiquette, or the commands of his benefactress, may not have hampered him, and caused the long delay which strikes us as strange. Living with the court - in Tunis probably - he would have been required to make a strong effort - to break through an established routine, and strike out for himself a new and unheard-of course, if he quitted the princess's household to make a tour of inspection among the enslaved Hebrews. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews seems to consider that his act in "going out" to "look upon the burdens" of his people involved a renunciation of his court life - a refusal to be called any more the son of Pharaoh's daughter (Hebrews 11:240; a casting-in of his lot with his brethren, so as thenceforth to be a sharer in their afflictions (<span class="accented">ib. ver.</span> 24). If this were so, we can well understand a long period of hesitation before the resolve was made to take the course from which there was no retreating. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Moses was grown</span>. "When he had become a mall of vigour and intelligence" (Kalisch). He went out. The expression is emphatic, and accords with the view above exhibited - that a complete change in the life of Moses was now effected, that the court was quitted, with its attractions and its temptations, its riches and its pleasures; and the position of adopted child of a princess forfeited<span class="cmt_word">. He spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew</span>. It is not certain that this was one of the "taskmasters" (<a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>); but most probably he was either a taskmaster, or one of the officers employed by them. Such persons are on the Egyptian monuments represented as armed with long rods, said to be "made of a tough pliant wood imported from Syria" (Chabas, 'Voyage d'un Egyptien,' p. 119). It was their right to employ their rods on the backs of the idle, a right which was sure to degenerate in many cases into tyrannous and cruel oppression. We may assume that it was an instance of such abuse of power that excited the anger of Moses; "seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was <span class="accented">oppressed"</span> (<a href="/acts/7-24.htm">Acts 7:24</a>).
