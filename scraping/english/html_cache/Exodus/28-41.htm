These garments symbolize the holiness and set-apart nature of the priesthood. Aaron and his sons are chosen from the tribe of Levi, highlighting the Levitical priesthood's role in Israel's worship. The act of putting on these garments signifies a transition from ordinary life to a sacred duty, emphasizing the importance of external symbols in representing internal spiritual truths.<p><b>anoint them</b><br>Anointing with oil is a significant ritual in the Old Testament, symbolizing the Holy Spirit's presence and empowerment. It sets individuals apart for God's service, as seen in the anointing of kings and prophets. The oil used is a special blend, as described in <a href="/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-25</a>, indicating the sacredness of the act. This anointing foreshadows the anointing of Jesus Christ, the ultimate High Priest, who was anointed by the Holy Spirit at His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>).<p><b>ordain them</b><br>Ordination involves a formal ceremony of commissioning for service. In the context of the priesthood, it includes the laying on of hands, sacrifices, and offerings, as detailed in <a href="/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a>. This process underscores the seriousness of the priestly office and the need for divine approval and empowerment. The ordination of Aaron and his sons establishes a hereditary priesthood, pointing to the eternal priesthood of Christ, who is ordained by God Himself (<a href="/hebrews/5-5.htm">Hebrews 5:5-6</a>).<p><b>and consecrate them</b><br>Consecration means to make holy or set apart for a sacred purpose. This involves rituals of purification and dedication, ensuring that the priests are ceremonially clean and spiritually prepared to serve. The consecration process includes washing, clothing, anointing, and sacrifices, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/29.htm">Exodus 29</a>. This act of consecration is a type of the sanctification believers undergo through Christ, who consecrates us by His blood (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>so that they may serve Me as priests</b><br>The primary role of the priests is to serve God by mediating between Him and the people. This service includes offering sacrifices, maintaining the tabernacle, and teaching the law. The priesthood is a vital component of Israel's covenant relationship with God, ensuring that worship is conducted according to His commands. This priestly service prefigures the ministry of Jesus, our High Priest, who serves as the mediator of a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, chosen by God to be the first high priest of Israel.
