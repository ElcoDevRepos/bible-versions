It was central to Israelite worship and housed the tablets of the Ten Commandments. The Ark symbolizes God's covenant with Israel and His holiness, requiring careful handling and reverence.<p><b>with its poles</b><br>The poles were used to carry the Ark, emphasizing the need for it to be transported without direct contact, as touching the Ark was forbidden. This reflects the holiness of God and the separation between the divine and the human. The poles were to remain in the rings of the Ark, signifying readiness for movement and the transient nature of the Israelites' journey.<p><b>and mercy seat</b><br>The mercy seat was the gold cover of the Ark, with two cherubim facing each other. It was the place where God's presence would appear and where the high priest would sprinkle the blood of the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement. This act symbolized atonement for the sins of Israel, prefiguring the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is our propitiation.<p><b>and the veil to shield it</b><br>The veil separated the Holy of Holies, where the Ark was kept, from the rest of the Tabernacle. It represented the barrier between God and humanity due to sin.
