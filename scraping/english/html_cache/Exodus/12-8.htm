The immediacy of "that night" underscores the urgency and readiness required for their impending exodus. This meal was to be consumed in haste, symbolizing the swift departure from bondage. The night also holds significance as it marks the time when the Lord passed over the houses of the Israelites, sparing them from the plague of the firstborn (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12-13</a>).<p><b>Roasted over the fire</b><br>Roasting the lamb over fire, rather than boiling or eating it raw, was a specific command. Fire symbolizes judgment and purification in the Bible, and this method of cooking can be seen as a representation of the judgment that passed over the Israelites. The roasting also ensured the lamb was consumed whole, without breaking any bones, which is a type of Christ, as none of His bones were broken during His crucifixion (<a href="/john/19-36.htm">John 19:36</a>).<p><b>Along with unleavened bread</b><br>Unleavened bread, or matzah, is bread made without yeast. In the context of the Passover, it symbolizes purity and the absence of sin, as leaven often represents sin and corruption in Scripture (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>). The haste of their departure from Egypt meant there was no time for the dough to rise, further emphasizing the urgency of their escape. This bread is also a reminder of the affliction and suffering endured in Egypt, as it is referred to as the "bread of affliction" (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>).<p><b>And bitter herbs</b><br>The bitter herbs, likely including plants such as chicory or endive, were eaten to remind the Israelites of the bitterness of their slavery in Egypt. This element of the meal serves as a tangible reminder of their past suffering and the harshness of their bondage. The bitterness also points to the suffering of Christ, who bore the bitterness of sin and death on behalf of humanity. The inclusion of bitter herbs in the Passover meal is a call to remember and reflect on the cost of redemption and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are in bondage in Egypt and are about to be delivered through the Passover event.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, representing a place of bondage and oppression.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A pivotal event in Israelite history where God delivers His people from slavery, marking the beginning of their journey to the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/unleavened_bread.htm">Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>Symbolizes purity and the haste in which the Israelites had to leave Egypt, as there was no time for the bread to rise.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bitter_herbs.htm">Bitter Herbs</a></b><br>Represent the bitterness of slavery and the suffering endured by the Israelites in Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_passover_meal.htm">Symbolism of the Passover Meal</a></b><br>The Passover meal is rich in symbolism, pointing to God's deliverance and the future sacrifice of Christ.

It was also the only mode open to all the Hebrews, since the generality would not possess cauldrons large enough to receive an entire lamb. Further, the requirement put a difference between this and other victims, which were generally cut up and boiled (<a href="/context/1_samuel/2-14.htm" title="And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the meat hook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came thither.">1Samuel 2:14-15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Unleavened bread . . . bitter herbs.</span>--As partaking of the lamb typified feeding on Christ, so the putting away of leaven and eating unleavened bread signified the putting away of all defilement and corruption ere we approach Christ to feed on Him (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.">1Corinthians 5:8</a>). As for the bitter herbs, they probably represented "self-denial" or "repentance"--fitting concomitants of the holy feast, where the Lamb of God is our food. At any rate, they were a protest against that animalism which turns a sacred banquet into a means of gratifying the appetite (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20-22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Roast with fire</span>. The meat of sacrificial meals was commonly boiled by the Hebrews (<a href="/1_samuel/2-14.htm">1 Samuel 2:14, 15</a>). The command to roast the Paschal lamb is accounted for: <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> By its being a simpler and quicker process than boiling; <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> By a special sanctity being regarded as attaching to fire; <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> By the difficulty of cooking the animal <span class="accented">whole</span> unless it were roasted. Justin Martyr's statement that for roasting two wooden spits were required, placed at right angles the one to the other, and thus extending the victim on a cross, will seem to many a better ground for the direction than any of these. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">unleavened bread</span>. See below, ver. 18. <span class="cmt_word">With bitter herbs</span>. Literally, "with bitternesses." That herbs, or vegetables of some kind, are intended, there is no reasonable doubt. The Mishna enumerates endive, chicory, wild lettuce, and nettles among the herbs that might be eaten. It is a strange notion of Kurtz's, that the bitter herbs were a condiment, and "communicated a more agreeable flavour to the food."
