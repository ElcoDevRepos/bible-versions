Sold into slavery by his brothers, he rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt. His life is a testament to God's providence and sovereignty, as he was used to preserve the lineage of Israel during a severe famine. Joseph is often seen as a type of Christ, as he was betrayed by his own, suffered unjustly, and ultimately became a savior to his people.<p><b>and all his brothers</b><br>Joseph's brothers, the sons of Jacob, are the patriarchs of the twelve tribes of Israel. Their actions, including selling Joseph into slavery, set the stage for the Israelites' eventual settlement in Egypt. This phrase marks the end of an era, as the original family of Israel passes away, setting the stage for the growth of the nation in a foreign land. The brothers' reconciliation with Joseph is a powerful story of forgiveness and redemption.<p><b>and all that generation died</b><br>This phrase signifies a significant transition in the narrative of the Israelites. The death of Joseph and his brothers marks the end of the patriarchal period and the beginning of a new chapter in Israel's history. It sets the stage for the Israelites' multiplication and eventual enslavement in Egypt, as described in the following verses. This transition also highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a land not their own, where they would be enslaved and mistreated for 400 years (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>).
