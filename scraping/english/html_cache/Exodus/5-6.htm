It highlights Pharaoh's determination to maintain control over the Israelites. The timing suggests a direct reaction to the confrontation with Moses, emphasizing the tension between divine command and human authority.<p><b>Pharaoh commanded</b><br>Pharaoh, as the ruler of Egypt, held absolute power and was considered a god by his people. His command reflects his authority and the centralized power structure of ancient Egypt. This also sets the stage for the ensuing conflict between Pharaoh's will and God's plan for the Israelites' liberation.<p><b>the taskmasters of the people</b><br>Taskmasters were Egyptian overseers responsible for enforcing labor among the Israelites. Their role was to ensure that the Israelites met their quotas and maintained productivity. This reflects the oppressive conditions under which the Israelites lived, fulfilling the prophecy of their enslavement in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>.<p><b>and their foremen</b><br>Foremen were likely Israelites appointed to manage their fellow Hebrews under the taskmasters' supervision. This hierarchical structure created division among the Israelites, as some were placed in positions of authority over others. It also illustrates the complexity of their oppression, as they were forced to participate in their own subjugation.<p><b>:</b><br>The colon indicates that what follows is a direct command from Pharaoh, setting the stage for the specific instructions that would increase the Israelites' burden.

The very day Moses and Aaron delivered God&#8217;s demand (<a href="/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1-4</a>), Pharaoh reacted without delay, underscoring his hardened heart (<a href="/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13</a>).<p>&#8211; Throughout Scripture, decisive &#8220;same-day&#8221; moments mark turning points&#8212;Noah entering the ark (<a href="/genesis/7-13.htm">Genesis 7:13</a>), Israel leaving Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-41.htm">Exodus 12:41</a>), Joshua&#8217;s crossing of the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>). Each signals that God&#8217;s purposes advance on His timetable, and human rulers cannot stall His plan.<p>&#8211; For the Israelites, this timing meant their suffering intensified precisely when hope had been announced&#8212;a theme echoed in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>, where momentary affliction precedes deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pharaoh commanded</b><p>&#8211; Pharaoh&#8217;s word carried unquestioned civil authority; yet every edict he issued became a stage for God to display supremacy (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>; <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>).<p>&#8211; Like the earlier order to drown Israel&#8217;s sons (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>) and the later pursuit to the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a>), this command reveals a ruler setting himself against the Lord (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2-4</a>).<p>&#8211; Such resistance foreshadows later tyrants&#8212;Nebuchadnezzar erecting an image (<a href="/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4-6</a>) and Herod slaughtering infants (<a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>). Each time, God overturns evil decrees and vindicates His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the taskmasters of the people</b><p>&#8211; Taskmasters were Egypt&#8217;s enforcers, already infamous for &#8220;ruthlessly&#8221; oppressing Israel (<a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11-14</a>). By addressing them first, Pharaoh targets the machinery of oppression.<p>&#8211; Their presence reminds us that systemic injustice often operates through layers of authority (<a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>). God hears the groans that rise from such bondage (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>; <a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a>).<p>&#8211; The gospel later contrasts this cruelty with Christ, whose yoke is easy and burden light (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and their foremen:</b><p>&#8211; Foremen were Hebrews appointed to relay orders and meet quotas (<a href="/exodus/5-14.htm">Exodus 5:14</a>). Pharaoh deliberately squeezes them between Egyptian masters and their own people, sowing division.<p>&#8211; When the quotas prove impossible, these foremen will be beaten (<a href="/exodus/5-14.htm">Exodus 5:14-16</a>), demonstrating how oppressive systems co-opt local leadership (compare Saul&#8217;s coercion of Doeg in <a href="/1_samuel/22-17.htm">1 Samuel 22:17-19</a>).<p>&#8211; Yet God eventually calls leaders from among the oppressed&#8212;Moses here, later Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-12</a>)&#8212;showing He redeems and re-commissions the very people the world tries to break.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a> captures a pivotal moment: on the very day God&#8217;s demand is proclaimed, Pharaoh issues a counter-command. His swift order mobilizes the existing hierarchy&#8212;Egyptian taskmasters and Hebrew foremen&#8212;to tighten Israel&#8217;s chains. The verse exposes human power that resists God, systems that exploit, and leaders caught in the middle. At the same time, it sets the stage for the Lord to unveil His greater authority, assuring us that even when oppression spikes, His redemptive plan moves forward right on schedule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Taskmasters . . . officers.</span>--Three grades of officials are mentioned as employed in superintending the forced labours of the Hebrews--(1) "lords of service" (<span class= "ital">sarey massim</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> in <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm" title="Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens.

The "lords of service" were probably a small body who exercised a general superintendence, and determined the works in which the Hebrews should be employed. They were, no doubt, native Egyptians. The <span class= "ital">nogeshim,</span> or "taskmasters," were their subordinates--Egyptians like themselves--comparatively numerous, and serving as intermediaries between the "lords" and the "officers." These last were Hebrews, and engaged mainly in keeping the tale of the bricks, and seeing that the proper number was reached. Such an organisation is consonant with all that we know of the Egyptian governmental system, which was bureaucratic and complex, involving in every department the employment of several grades of officials.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-9.</span> - Rulers are not always content simply to refuse inconvenient demands. Sometimes they set to work with much ingenuity and worldly wisdom to prevent their repetition. This is especially the case where they entertain a fear of their petitioners. The Spartans removed Helots, who had earned their freedom, by the Crypteia. The massacre of St. Bartholomew was caused by the Huguenot demand for freedom of worship and the difficulty of repressing it. The Pharaoh now is not content to let things take their course, but devises a plan by which he hopes to crush altogether the aspirations of the Hebrew people, and secure himself against the recurrence of any such appeal as that which had been made to him by Moses and Aaron. The Israelites had recently been employed chiefly in brickmaking. They had had to dig the clay and temper it, to mix it with straw, and mould it into the form of bricks; but the straw had been supplied to them. The king determined that this should be no longer done; the Israelites should find the straw for themselves. It has been estimated that by this change their labour was "more than doubled." (Canon Cook.) It was a not unreasonable expectation that under this system popular meetings would cease (ver. 9); and that Moses and Aaron, not being backed up by the voice of the people, would discontinue their agitation. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The same day</span>. Pharaoh lost no time. Having conceived his idea, he issued his order at once-on the very day of the interview with the two leaders. It would be well if the children of light were as "wise" and as energetic on all occasions as the children of darkness. <span class="cmt_word">Taskmasters and officers</span>. The word translated "taskmaster" here is not the same as the expression similarly rendered in <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>; and it is thought not to designate the same class. The <span class="accented">sarey massim</span> of the former passage are thought to be general superintendents of works, few in number and of high rank, the <span class="accented">nogeshim</span> of the present place to be subordinates, numerous and inferior in position. Both of these classes were probably Egyptians. The "officers" (<span class="accented">shoterim</span>) were undoubtedly Hebrews. They were especially employed in keeping the tale of the bricks, and seeing that they reached the proper amount. Literally, the word <span class="accented">shoterim</span> means "<span class="accented">scribes</span>," and is so rendered in most passages. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">That same</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(bay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Pharaoh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">commanded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1445;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7779;aw)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6680.htm">Strong's 6680: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay charge (upon), give charge (to), command, order</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the taskmasters</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1465;&#1490;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7713;&#601;&#183;&#347;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5065.htm">Strong's 5065: </a> </span><span class="str2">To drive, to tax, harass, tyrannize</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and their foremen:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1496;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#333;&#183;&#7789;&#601;&#183;r&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7860.htm">Strong's 7860: </a> </span><span class="str2">A scribe, an official superintendent, magistrate</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/5-6.htm">OT Law: Exodus 5:6 The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters (Exo.
