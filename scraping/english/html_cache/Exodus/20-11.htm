It connects to <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where the creation account is detailed, underscoring the intentional and structured nature of God's work. The mention of "heavens and the earth" signifies the totality of creation, encompassing everything from the celestial bodies to the terrestrial realm. The inclusion of "the sea and all that is in them" highlights the comprehensive scope of God's creative act, affirming His sovereignty over all life forms and natural elements. This phrase also serves as a foundation for understanding the biblical worldview of creation, contrasting with other ancient Near Eastern creation myths by attributing creation solely to the LORD.<p><b>but on the seventh day He rested</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of divine rest, which is not due to fatigue but signifies completion and satisfaction with creation. It establishes a pattern for human rest and worship, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>, where God sanctifies the seventh day. The rest here is a cessation from creative work, setting a precedent for the Sabbath. This divine rest is a model for humanity, emphasizing the importance of rest and reflection in the rhythm of life. It also foreshadows the ultimate rest found in Christ, as discussed in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>, where believers are invited to enter God's rest through faith.<p><b>Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart as holy</b><br>This phrase highlights the sanctification of the Sabbath, marking it as a day distinct from the others. The blessing of the Sabbath indicates God's favor and the special significance of this day for His people. Setting it apart as holy underscores its purpose for rest and worship, serving as a covenant sign between God and Israel, as elaborated in <a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13-17</a>. The Sabbath is a reminder of God's creative work and His deliverance, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>, where it also commemorates the Exodus. In the New Testament, the principle of Sabbath rest is fulfilled in Christ, who offers spiritual rest and renewal, as seen in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>. The Sabbath thus becomes a symbol of the eternal rest promised to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The Creator of the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them.

Living within this pattern honors His creative authority, nurtures physical and spiritual rest, and points forward to the eternal rest secured in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth.</span>--Comp. <a href="/context/genesis/2-2.htm" title="And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.">Genesis 2:2-3</a>, and <a href="/exodus/31-17.htm" title="It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.">Exodus 31:17</a>. It is not improbable that the work of creation was made to occupy six days because one day in seven is the appropriate proportion of rest to labour for such a being as man. God might have created all things on one day had He so pleased; but, having the institution of the Sabbath in view, He prefigured it by spreading His work over six days, and then resting on the seventh. His law of the Sabbath established a conformity between the method of His own working and that of His reasonable creatures, and taught men to look on work, not as an aimless, indefinite, incessant, weary round, but as leading on to an end, a rest, a fruition, a time for looking back, and seeing the result and rejoicing in it. Each Sabbath is such a time, and is a type and foretaste of that eternal "sabbatising" in another world which "remaineth for the people of God" (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm" title="There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.">Hebrews 4:9</a>). The secondary object of the institution of the Sabbath, assigned in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm" title="And remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD your God brought you out there through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day.">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>, is in no way incompatible with this primary one. The thought of God's works in creation might well be associated in the mind of an. Israelite with the thought of His "wondrous works" in Egypt, and the recollection of the blessed peace and rest in which creation resulted, with the memory of the glad time of repose and refreshment which supervened upon the weary task work of the Egyptian bondage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</span>. Two reasons are assigned for the sanctification of the seventh day in the Pentateuch: - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The fact that the work of creation took six days, and that on the seventh God rested; and <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The further fact, that God brought the Israelites out of Egypt, and gave them a time of rest after a time of labour and toil (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>). It is not expressly said that the deliverance took place on the Sabbath, but such is the Jewish tradition on the subject. The reason here assigned must be regarded as the main reason, man's rest being purposely assimilated to God's rest, in order to show the resemblance between man's nature and God's (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), and to point towards that eternal rest wherein man, united with God, will find his highest bliss and the true end of his being. "There remaineth a rest for the people of God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/20-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[in] six</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#234;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8337.htm">Strong's 8337: </a> </span><span class="str2">Six (a cardinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the heavens</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;ma&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
