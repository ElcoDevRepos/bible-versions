Previously, Pharaoh had attempted to negotiate by allowing only the men to go or by keeping the livestock (<a href="/exodus/10-24.htm">Exodus 10:24</a>). The inclusion of flocks and herds signifies a complete release, acknowledging the Israelites' need for sacrifices and sustenance. This reflects God's power in fulfilling His promise to deliver His people completely (<a href="/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>).<p><b>just as you have said</b><br>Pharaoh's words here echo Moses' earlier requests (<a href="/exodus/10-9.htm">Exodus 10:9</a>). This phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's word through Moses, highlighting the authority and accuracy of prophetic declarations. It also demonstrates Pharaoh's reluctant submission to God's will, as he repeats the terms Moses had set forth, showing the triumph of divine over human authority.<p><b>and depart!</b><br>The command to "depart" signifies the culmination of the Exodus narrative, where the Israelites are finally freed from Egyptian bondage. This moment is pivotal in Israel's history, marking the beginning of their journey to the Promised Land. It also prefigures the spiritual liberation found in Christ, who delivers believers from the bondage of sin (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<p><b>And bless me also.&#8221;</b><br>Pharaoh's request for a blessing is significant, as it reveals a moment of vulnerability and recognition of the God of Israel's power. Despite his hardened heart, Pharaoh seeks favor from the very people he oppressed. This request can be seen as an acknowledgment of the true God, contrasting with the Egyptian pantheon. It also foreshadows the blessing to all nations through Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who brings salvation to all

flocks and herds as well</b><p>Pharaoh&#8217;s words reveal complete surrender to God&#8217;s demand. Earlier he tried to bargain&#8212;first allowing sacrifice within Egypt (<a href="/exodus/8-25.htm">Exodus 8:25</a>), then permitting only the men to leave (<a href="/exodus/10-11.htm">Exodus 10:11</a>), then insisting the livestock stay behind (<a href="/exodus/10-24.htm">Exodus 10:24</a>). Now, under the weight of the tenth plague, he grants everything. The livestock mattered for:<p>&#8226;Continued worship&#8212;Israel needed animals for the commanded sacrifices (<a href="/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/10-25.htm">Exodus 10:25&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226;Economic survival on the journey and in the land of promise (<a href="/genesis/46-32.htm">Genesis 46:32</a>; <a href="/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3&#8211;6</a>).<p>By letting the Israelites leave with their animals, Pharaoh unwittingly fulfills God&#8217;s promise to bring His people out &#8220;with great possessions&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Just as you have said</b><p>This phrase underscores that Moses&#8217; God-given terms have not changed. Pharaoh must accept them exactly. It highlights:<p>&#8226;The authority of God&#8217;s word over human power (<a href="/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1</a>).<p>&#8226;The faithfulness of Moses in speaking only what the Lord commanded (<a href="/exodus/7-2.htm">Exodus 7:2</a>).<p>&#8226;The futility of compromise with sin; true deliverance comes on God&#8217;s terms alone (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And depart!</b><p>The imperative captures the urgency in Egypt after the death of the firstborn (<a href="/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30</a>). The Egyptians &#8220;pressed&#8221; the people &#8220;to hurry and leave the land&#8221; so they themselves would not die (<a href="/exodus/12-33.htm">Exodus 12:33</a>). The exodus becomes:<p>&#8226;A literal, historic exit from bondage (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1</a>).<p>&#8226;A picture of salvation&#8212;God breaking sin&#8217;s grip and leading His people out (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>).<p>The same God who judges also provides a way of escape through obedience and the blood of the Passover lamb (<a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>; <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And bless me also</b><p>Pharaoh, once defiant, now pleads for intercession. He recognizes:<p>&#8226;The superiority of Israel&#8217;s God (<a href="/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>; <a href="/exodus/10-17.htm">Exodus 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226;His own need for mercy after experiencing judgment (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>Ironically, the oppressor asks blessing from the oppressed, fulfilling God&#8217;s word that through Abraham&#8217;s offspring &#8220;all peoples on earth will be blessed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). Moses later prays for Pharaoh at Rephidim (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8&#8211;12</a> indirectly shows continuing mercy toward Amalekites; pattern of intercession). God&#8217;s people are called to bless even former enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>; <a href="/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/12-32.htm">Exodus 12:32</a> records Pharaoh&#8217;s total capitulation to the Lord&#8217;s demands: Israel may take every person and possession, leave Egypt immediately, and even bestow a blessing on their former master. The verse showcases God&#8217;s unrivaled authority, the necessity of full obedience, the completeness of the deliverance He provides, and His intention that His redeemed people become a channel of blessing to the nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">And bless me also.</span>--Here Pharaoh's humiliation reaches its extreme point. He is reduced by the terrible calamity of the last plague not only to grant all the demands made of him freely, and without restriction, but to crave the favour of a blessing from those whom he had despised, rebuked (<a href="/exodus/5-4.htm" title="And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do you, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you to your burdens.">Exodus 5:4</a>), thwarted, and finally driven from his presence under the threat of death (<a href="/exodus/10-28.htm" title="And Pharaoh said to him, Get you from me, take heed to yourself, see my face no more; for in that day you see my face you shall die.">Exodus 10:28</a>).

Pharaoh was probably accustomed to receive blessings from his own priests, and had thus been led to value them. His desire for a blessing from Moses and Aaron, ere they departed, probably sprang from a conviction - based on the miracles which he had witnessed - that their intercession would avail more with God than that of his own hierarchy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/12-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Take</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1495;&#1435;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your flocks</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;&#1504;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1448;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#333;&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
