A covenant in biblical terms is a solemn agreement between God and His people, often involving promises and obligations. This renewal signifies God's mercy and willingness to continue His relationship with Israel despite their previous disobedience. The concept of covenant is central to the biblical narrative, beginning with God's covenant with Noah, continuing with Abraham, and later with David, ultimately finding fulfillment in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, <a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>).<p><b>Before all your people I will perform wonders</b><br>The wonders refer to miraculous acts that God will perform to demonstrate His power and presence among His people. These acts serve as signs of divine authority and are meant to inspire faith and obedience. Historically, the wonders performed during the Exodus, such as the plagues in Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea, were unparalleled demonstrations of God's power. These wonders foreshadow the miracles of Jesus, who performed signs and wonders to reveal His divine nature and mission (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>, <a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>).<p><b>that have never been done in any nation in all the world.</b><br>This emphasizes the uniqueness of God's actions on behalf of Israel, setting them apart from other nations. The historical context highlights the distinctiveness of Israel's relationship with God, who chose them as His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The phrase underscores the unprecedented nature of God's intervention in human history, which is a recurring theme in the Bible, culminating in the incarnation of Jesus Christ, an event unparalleled in its significance (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>All the people among whom you live will see the LORD&#8217;s work,</b><br>This indicates that God's actions will be visible not only to Israel but also to surrounding nations. The visibility of God's work serves as a testimony to His power and sovereignty, intended to draw others to acknowledge Him. In the biblical narrative, the surrounding nations often witnessed God's mighty acts, leading to fear and respect for Israel's God (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). This foreshadows the Great Commission, where the works of God through Christ are to be proclaimed to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>for it is an awesome thing that I am doing with you.</b><br>The term "awesome" conveys a sense of reverence and fear, reflecting the overwhelming nature of God's deeds. The historical and cultural context of the ancient Near East often involved gods who were distant and capricious, but the God of Israel is actively involved with His people, performing acts that inspire awe. This anticipates the ultimate act of God in the New Testament, where the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ are the most awe-inspiring events in salvation history (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-making God of Israel, who reveals His power and faithfulness through miraculous deeds.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who acts as the mediator between God and the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, recipients of the covenant and witnesses to God's wonders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>A divine agreement initiated by God, emphasizing His commitment to His people and their unique relationship with Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wonders.htm">Wonders</a></b><br>Miraculous acts performed by God, demonstrating His power and setting Israel apart from other nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_covenant.htm">God's Faithfulness in Covenant</a></b><br>God initiates and maintains His covenant with His people, demonstrating His unwavering faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_wonders.htm">The Power of God's Wonders</a></b><br>God's miraculous works serve as a testament to His power and a means to reveal His glory to the nations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_unique_relationship_with_god.htm">The Unique Relationship with God</a></b><br>As recipients of God's covenant, believers are called to live in a way that reflects their unique relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witnessing_to_the_nations.htm">Witnessing to the Nations</a></b><br>God's wonders are not only for the benefit of His people but also serve as a witness to the surrounding nations of His sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/anticipation_of_greater_works.htm">Anticipation of Greater Works</a></b><br>The wonders of the Old Covenant point forward to the greater works accomplished through Jesus Christ in the New Covenant.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_34_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 34:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/God_s_power_faith_in_Exodus_34_10.htm">How does God's covenant in Exodus 34:10 demonstrate His power and faithfulness?

This renewal underscores His faithfulness despite their failure (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). Like His earlier covenants with Noah (<a href="/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9</a>) and Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>), this one is initiated and guaranteed by Him. It also echoes <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, reminding Israel that obedience brings blessing and mission. The covenant sets the stage for everything that follows, assuring the people that God&#8217;s promises stand firm (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before all your people</b><p>These words highlight that what God is about to do is public and communal. The entire nation, not just Moses, will witness His actions, reinforcing that their relationship with Him is corporate (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>). Like the plagues in Egypt, the coming works will shape Israel&#8217;s identity and memory (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-2.htm">Deuteronomy 29:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will perform wonders that have never been done in any nation in all the world</b><p>The forthcoming miracles&#8212;crossing the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>), Jericho&#8217;s walls falling (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>)&#8212;will surpass anything seen before. They will confirm God&#8217;s supremacy (<a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>) and display His exclusivity (<a href="/1_kings/8-23.htm">1 Kings 8:23</a>). These wonders foreshadow the ultimate miracle of redemption through Christ, who performed works unheard of (<a href="/john/9-32.htm">John 9:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the people among whom you live will see the LORD&#8217;s work</b><p>God&#8217;s purpose goes beyond Israel; surrounding nations will observe and acknowledge His power (<a href="/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10-11</a>). Rahab, the Gibeonites, and later the Queen of Sheba (<a href="/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>) testify to this. Israel is called to be a light, revealing God&#8217;s glory so that Gentiles might turn to Him (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For it is an awesome thing that I am doing with you</b><p>&#8220;Awe&#8221; implies both wonder and holy fear.

The early church lived in similar awe after Christ&#8217;s resurrection: &#8220;Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and signs were being performed by the apostles&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-43.htm">Acts 2:43</a>). The pattern remains&#8212;God&#8217;s mighty acts invite reverent response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/34-10.htm">Exodus 34:10</a> shows God graciously renewing His covenant with a repentant people, promising unprecedented wonders that will publicly reveal His glory. These acts will deepen Israel&#8217;s faith, witness to the nations, and evoke holy awe. The verse points forward to God&#8217;s ultimate covenant fulfillment in Christ, whose redemptive work is the greatest &#8220;awesome thing&#8221; ever done for His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">I make a covenant</span>--i.e., "I lay down afresh the terms of the covenant which I am content to make with Israel.
