The act of entrusting animals to a neighbor reflects a community-based approach to property and responsibility. In biblical times, animals like donkeys, oxen, and sheep were essential for transportation, agriculture, and sustenance. The mention of these specific animals highlights their importance in daily life and economic stability. This practice underscores the communal trust and mutual dependence among neighbors, which is a recurring theme in the Mosaic Law. The law provided guidelines to ensure fairness and accountability, reflecting God's concern for justice and community harmony.<p><b>but it dies or is injured or stolen while no one is watching</b><br>This part of the verse addresses potential disputes arising from unforeseen circumstances affecting the entrusted animals. The phrase "while no one is watching" implies a situation where there are no witnesses to the event, making it difficult to ascertain responsibility. The law here anticipates such situations and provides a framework for resolving them. This reflects the broader biblical principle of justice and fairness, as seen in other parts of the Mosaic Law, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, which emphasizes the need for witnesses in legal matters. The provision for these scenarios also points to the fallen nature of the world, where accidents and theft occur, necessitating laws to maintain order and justice. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate just judge and shepherd, caring for His flock and ensuring justice is served.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_giver.htm">The Giver</a></b><br>The person who entrusts their animal to a neighbor for safekeeping.

One person places what belongs to him into another&#8217;s hands. Compare <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35</a>, where Israel is told to support a needy brother, and <a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a>, &#8220;Do not withhold good from the one to whom it is due, when it is in your power to act&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The list &#8220;donkey, ox, sheep&#8221; covers work animals and flock animals, then widens to &#8220;any other animal,&#8221; showing the principle applies broadly. <a href="/exodus/21-33.htm">Exodus 21:33-34</a> offers a similar all-inclusive approach when dealing with an injured ox.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to be cared for by his neighbor</b><p>&#8226; A neighbor receives the animal not as owner but as custodian. This is a trust, echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/22-1.htm">Deuteronomy 22:1-3</a>, where found property must be kept safe until returned.<p>&#8226; The responsibility is protective, not merely passive. <a href="/genesis/30-31.htm">Genesis 30:31-33</a> shows Jacob actively shepherding Laban&#8217;s flock; faithful care includes effort and vigilance.<p>&#8226; Jesus uses the shepherd image in <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3-4</a> to highlight personal, attentive oversight&#8212;an everyday picture of covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but it dies or is injured or stolen</b><p>&#8226; Three outcomes summarize common losses:<p>&#8211; Death (natural or accidental)<p>&#8211; Injury (partial loss of value)<p>&#8211; Theft (total loss through wrongdoing)<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/22-12.htm">Exodus 22:12</a> will specify that if an animal is stolen and the neighbor can prove it, he is not liable. The law distinguishes unavoidable events from negligence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/24-18.htm">Leviticus 24:18</a> mandates restitution when a life is taken, revealing God&#8217;s concern for equity.

When one neighbor entrusts his animals to another, God expects diligent care, truthful reporting, and respect for property even when loss occurs out of sight.
