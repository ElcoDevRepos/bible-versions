The poles, made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold, were designed to ensure that the Ark was never touched directly by human hands, preserving its sanctity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the need for separation between the divine and the profane. The Ark, representing God's presence among His people, was to be treated with utmost reverence. The use of poles also facilitated the mobility of the Ark, allowing it to be carried by the Levites as the Israelites journeyed through the wilderness. This mobility symbolizes God's guidance and presence with His people wherever they go.<p><b>they must not be removed.</b><br>The permanence of the poles in the rings signifies the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel. This command underscores the idea that God's presence and His promises are constant and unchanging. The instruction also serves as a safeguard against the Ark being mishandled or desecrated, as seen in the tragic incident involving Uzzah in <a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>, where touching the Ark led to his death. This highlights the seriousness with which God views His commands and the importance of obedience. The unremovable poles can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the unchanging mediator of the New Covenant, always present and accessible to believers, yet never to be approached casually or irreverently.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the construction of the Ark of the Covenant from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's covenant with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were to follow His commandments and carry the Ark during their journey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God gave Moses the instructions for the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the Ark.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where the Ark was housed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_instructions.htm">Reverence for God's Instructions</a></b><br>The command to keep the poles in the rings signifies the importance of adhering to God's specific instructions.

This underlines that the design of the ark came directly from the Lord (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9-10</a>).<p>- Because every detail of the tabernacle pointed to God&#8217;s holiness, permanent poles testified to His unchanging nature and to the unalterable requirements for approaching Him (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p>- Cross reference: when the tabernacle was dismantled, only the Kohathites were to handle the holy objects, &#8220;but they must not touch the holy things, or they will die&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). Fixed poles made safe transport possible without direct contact.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the rings</b><p>- The rings were not decorative; they were functional appointments God commanded (<a href="/exodus/25-12.htm">Exodus 25:12</a>). Poles inserted through rings illustrate mediation&#8212;there is always something between sinful people and God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p>- By remaining in the rings, the poles ensured readiness. Israel never knew when the cloud would lift (<a href="/numbers/9-17.htm">Numbers 9:17-19</a>). A ready ark reminded them to live in a state of obedience and watchfulness (<a href="/matthew/24-44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the ark</b><p>- The ark represented God&#8217;s throne on earth (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). Everything connected to it, including poles and rings, was set apart as &#8220;most holy&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26-29</a>).<p>- Cross reference: when David later transported the ark incorrectly on a cart, disaster struck (<a href="/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3-7</a>). The poles define the only God-approved method of movement, emphasizing reverence and submission (<a href="/psalms/89-7.htm">Psalm 89:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they must not be removed</b><p>- A non-negotiable command stresses that human convenience may never overrule divine instruction (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-32.htm">Deuteronomy 12:32</a>).<p>- Permanently attached poles safeguarded future generations from forgetting God&#8217;s pattern, just as the bronze snake was preserved until misuse required its destruction (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>).<p>- The warning anticipates the temptation to treat the ark as common furniture; keeping the poles locked in place guards against casual familiarity (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/25-15.htm">Exodus 25:15</a> teaches that God&#8217;s presence demands perpetual reverence, exact obedience, and constant readiness.
