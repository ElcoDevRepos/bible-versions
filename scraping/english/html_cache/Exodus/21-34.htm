The law required that if a person dug a pit and failed to cover it, leading to harm or loss, they were responsible for compensating the affected party. This reflects the broader biblical principle of justice and fairness, as seen in other parts of the Mosaic Law (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/24-18.htm">Leviticus 24:18-21</a>). The concept of restitution is also echoed in the New Testament, where Zacchaeus, upon his conversion, promises to repay those he has wronged (<a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>).<p><b>he must pay its owner,</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the necessity of financial compensation for loss. In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, livestock was a valuable asset, and losing an animal could significantly impact a family's livelihood. The requirement to pay the owner underscores the value placed on property rights and the importance of maintaining community harmony. This principle of compensation is consistent with the broader biblical theme of restoring what has been lost or damaged, as seen in the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25).<p><b>and the dead animal will be his.</b><br>By stating that the dead animal becomes the property of the pit owner, the law ensures that the original owner is compensated while the responsible party bears the consequence of their negligence. This transfer of ownership also serves as a deterrent against carelessness. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who takes on the consequences of sin (death) on behalf of humanity, offering restitution and reconciliation with God. This principle of substitution and bearing the burden of another is central to the message of the Gospel (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/owner_of_the_pit.htm">Owner of the Pit</a></b><br>This refers to the individual responsible for creating or leaving open a pit that causes harm.

True repentance expresses itself in tangible, measurable repair of the damage done.<p>&#8226; By commanding restitution, the Lord teaches Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that justice is more than punishment; it is restoration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he must pay its owner</b><p>&#8226; The verse specifies the direction of payment: back to the injured party. <a href="/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1&#8211;5</a> follows the same pattern for stolen sheep, scorched fields, or wandering livestock.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law refuses generic fines that enrich the state while the victim stays hurt. The loss lands on a real neighbor, so the compensation must reach that same neighbor (see <a href="/romans/13-8.htm">Romans 13:8</a>, &#8220;Owe no one anything, except to love one another&#8221;).<p>&#8226; This safeguards community harmony and prevents resentment from festering.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the dead animal will be his</b><p>&#8226; After repayment, the carcass becomes the negligent party&#8217;s property. Why?<p>&#8211; It lets the original owner walk away free of further inconvenience.<p>&#8211; It reminds the wrongdoer that his negligence still costs him; he now deals with disposal or salvage (cf. <a href="/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a>, where unusable carcasses symbolize impurity).<p>&#8211; It closes the case cleanly, barring endless disputes about shared loss.<p>&#8226; By assigning the remains to the responsible party, God enforces consequences without wasting resources&#8212;if the hide or meat can be used for another purpose, that potential belongs to the one who paid.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/21-34.htm">Exodus 21:34</a> teaches that when my actions&#8212;or inactions&#8212;harm another, God requires full restitution. Responsibility attaches to the one who caused the loss, payment goes straight to the victim, and whatever remains of the damage now belongs to the guilty party.
