Moses is often seen as a type of Christ, who also serves as a mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The direct speech from God underscores the authority and authenticity of the message.<p><b>This is what you are to tell the Israelites</b><br>God's instructions to Moses highlight the covenant relationship between God and the Israelites. The Israelites are God's chosen people, set apart to receive His laws and commandments. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's desire to communicate His will to His people, as seen throughout the Old and New Testaments.<p><b>You have seen for yourselves</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the experiential aspect of the Israelites' relationship with God. They have witnessed God's power and presence, particularly at Mount Sinai, where God manifested Himself in a tangible way (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>). This personal experience serves as a foundation for their faith and obedience.<p><b>that I have spoken to you from heaven</b><br>The reference to God speaking "from heaven" underscores His transcendence and authority. It distinguishes the divine origin of the commandments from any human or earthly source. This heavenly communication is a precursor to the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who also speaks with divine authority (<a href="/john/3-31.htm">John 3:31-34</a>).

This intermediate revelation appears to have been at once committed to writing, and in its written shape was known as "the Book of the Covenant " (<a href="/exodus/24-7.htm" title="And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD has said will we do, and be obedient.">Exodus 24:7</a>), and regarded with special veneration.<p>"The Book of the Covenant" is wanting in system and arrangement, but is not wholly unsystematic. It commences with some laws concerning the worship of God (<a href="/context/exodus/20-22.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, You have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.">Exodus 20:22-26</a>), proceeds from the Divine to the human, and treats in its second section (<a href="/context/exodus/21-1.htm" title="Now these are the judgments which you shall set before them.">Exodus 21:1-32</a>) of "the rights of persons," then concerns itself with "the rights of property" (<a href="/exodus/21-33.htm" title="And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;">Exodus 21:33</a> to <a href="/exodus/22-15.htm" title="But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.">Exodus 22:15</a>), and, finally, winds up with "miscellaneous laws" (<a href="/exodus/22-16.htm" title="And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.">Exodus 22:16</a> to <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm" title="The first of the first fruits of your land you shall bring into the house of the LORD your God. You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.">Exodus 23:19</a>), partly on things Divine, partly on things human--the things Divine being reserved to the last, so that the end of the legislation is in close harmony with the beginning. Altogether, the enactments contained in the short space of three chapters are some seventy; and the "Book of the Covenant" is thus no mere tentative sketch; but a very wonderful condensation of the essence of all the more important matters which Moses afterwards put forth by Divine inspiration in the long space of nearly forty years. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-26.</span> - THE BOOK OF THE COVENANT, (chap. 20. ver. 22, to chap. 22. ver. 23). The Decalogue is followed by a series of laws, civil, social, and religious, which occupy the remainder of ch. 20. and the whole of the three following chapters (ch. 21, 22. and 23.). It appears from ch. 24. that these laws, received by Moses on Sinai, immediately after the delivery of the ten commandments, were at once committed to writing and collected into a book, which was known as "the Book of the Covenant" (<a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>), and was regarded as a specially sacred volume. The document, as it has come down to us, "cannot be regarded as a strictly systematic whole" (Canon Cook): yet still, it is not wholly unsystematic,but aims in some degree at an orderly arrangement. First and foremost are placed the laws which concern the worship of God, which are two in number: - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Against idols; <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Concerning altars (<a href="/exodus/20-23.htm">Exodus 20:23-26</a>). <p>Then follow the laws respecting what our legal writers call "the rights of persons" - which occupy thirty-two verses of ch. 21. and fall under some twenty different heads, beginning with the rights of slaves, and terminating with the compensation to be made for injuries to the person caused by cattle. The third section is upon "the rights of property," and extends from <a href="/exodus/21-33.htm">Exodus 21:33</a>, to <a href="/exodus/22-15.htm">Exodus 22:15</a>, including some ten or twelve enactments. After this we can only say that the laws are mixed, some being concerned with Divine things (as ch. 22:20, 29, 30; and ch. 23. 10-19): others with human, and these last being of various kinds, all, however, more or less "connected with the civil organization of the state" (Kalisch). In the fourth section the enactments seem to fall under about twenty-five heads. The result is that the "Book of the Covenant" contains, in little more than three chapters, about seventy distinct laws. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven</span>. The book opened with this reminder, which at once recalled its author and declared its authority. "I, who give these laws, am the same who spake the ten commandments amid the thunders of Sinai. Reverence the laws accordingly." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/20-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
