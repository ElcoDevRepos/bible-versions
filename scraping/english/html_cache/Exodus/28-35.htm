The robe is part of the sacred vestments described in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>, designed for glory and beauty. The robe's significance is tied to the holiness required in approaching God, symbolizing the need for purity and divine appointment. The high priest's attire sets him apart, indicating his unique role as a mediator between God and the Israelites. This concept of priestly garments foreshadows the righteousness of Christ, our High Priest, who clothes believers in His righteousness.<p><b>and its sound will be heard</b><br>The sound refers to the bells attached to the hem of the robe. These bells served a practical purpose, signaling the high priest's movements within the sanctuary. The sound ensured that the priest was alive and active in his duties, providing reassurance to those outside the Holy Place. This auditory element underscores the transparency and accountability required in the priestly office. The bells can also symbolize the proclamation of God's presence and the priest's active role in intercession.<p><b>when he enters or exits the sanctuary before the LORD</b><br>The sanctuary, or Holy Place, is where the high priest performs his sacred duties. Entering and exiting the sanctuary signifies the priest's direct service to God, highlighting the solemnity and reverence required in worship. The phrase "before the LORD" indicates the presence of God, reminding us of His holiness and the need for proper preparation and conduct in His presence. This access to the sanctuary prefigures Christ's role in granting believers access to God through His sacrifice.<p><b>so that he will not die</b><br>This phrase underscores the seriousness of approaching God improperly. The high priest's life depended on adhering to God's instructions, reflecting the holiness and justice of God. The consequence of death for disobedience or negligence highlights the gravity of sin and the need for atonement. This serves as a reminder of the sacrificial system's temporary nature, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law and provided eternal access to God without fear of death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
