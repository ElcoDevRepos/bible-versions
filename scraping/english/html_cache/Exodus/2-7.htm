Her presence indicates the protective and resourceful nature of Moses' family. In the cultural context of ancient Egypt, it was unusual for a Hebrew girl to approach Egyptian royalty, highlighting Miriam's courage and quick thinking. This moment foreshadows Miriam's later role as a leader among the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20-21</a>). The interaction between a Hebrew child and Egyptian royalty also sets the stage for Moses' unique position as a bridge between two cultures.<p><b>&#8220;Shall I go and call one of the Hebrew women</b><br>This phrase suggests a strategic plan to ensure Moses' survival and connection to his Hebrew roots. The use of "Hebrew women" indicates the ethnic distinction and separation between the Hebrews and Egyptians, a recurring theme in Exodus. This separation underscores the Israelites' identity as God's chosen people, distinct from the surrounding nations. The proposal to involve a Hebrew woman also reflects the cultural practice of wet-nursing, common in ancient societies, where infants were often nursed by women other than their mothers.<p><b>to nurse the child for you?&#8221;</b><br>The act of nursing is significant both practically and symbolically. It ensures Moses' survival and maintains his connection to his biological family and heritage. This arrangement allows Moses' mother, Jochebed, to care for him during his formative years, instilling in him the faith and traditions of the Hebrews. This nurturing period is crucial for Moses' later role as the leader and deliverer of Israel. Theologically, this moment can be seen as part of God's providential plan, ensuring that Moses is raised with an understanding of his identity and mission. Moses' life, from his preservation as an infant to his leadership, can be seen as a type of Christ, who also had a miraculous preservation in infancy (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_girl.htm">The Girl (Miriam)</a></b><br>Miriam, the sister of Moses, plays a crucial role in the preservation of her brother's life.

The verse testifies that God&#8217;s providence operates through willing hearts, courageous speech, and family devotion, setting the stage for the liberator of Israel to grow up under divine protection and preparation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Then said his sister.</span>--Miriam had bided her time. She had still kept in the background, but had approached within hearing distance; and when the princess observed that the babe must be "one of the Hebrews' children," was prompt with the rejoinder, "Shall I not fetch thee then a Hebrew mother to nurse him?" If the child was to be nursed at all--if he was to be brought up--a Hebrew nurse would be the fittest.<p><span class= "bld">That she may nurse the child for thee.</span>--"For thee." Miriam divines the thought of the princess, or half divines, half anticipates it, and helps to make it take a fixed shape. She assumes that the child is to be brought up, and <span class= "ital">for the princess, </span>as her <span class= "ital">protege, </span>at any rate, if not something more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Then said his sister</span>. Miriam had watched to some purpose. She had seen everything - she had drawn near as she beheld the "maid" go down to the water's edge, and take the ark out. She had heard the words of the princess; and thereupon she promptly spoke - <span class="cmt_word">"Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women?"</span> No doubt, all had been prepared beforehand by the mother, who had selected the place and time of the exposure from a knowledge of the habits and character of the princess, had set her daughter to watch, and - so far as was possible - instructed her what she was to say. But Miriant at least carried out the instructions given her with excellent judgment and tact. She did not speak too soon, nor too late. She did not say a word too much, nor too little. "Surely," exclaimed the princess, "this is one of the Hebrews, children." "Shall I fetch thee then a Hebrew mother to nurse him? is the rejoinder. Egyptians, it is implied, cannot properly nurse Hebrews - cannot know how they ought to be treated; an Egyptian nurse would mismanage the boy - shall I fetch one of his own nation? And the princess, feeling all the force of the reasoning, answers in one short pregnant word - "<span class="cmt_word">Go</span>." "Yes," she means, "do so; that will be best." And then the result follows - "<span class="cmt_word">The maid</span> (Miriam) <span class="cmt_word">went and called the child's mother</span>." So the scheming of the loving mother, and the skilful performance of the part assigned her by the clever sister, were crowned with success - Moses' life was saved, and yet he was not separated from his natural guardian, nor given over to the tender mercies of strangers: the child went back to his own home, to his own apartment, to his own cradle; continued to be nourished by his own mother's milk; and received those first impressions, which are so indelibly impressed upon the mind, in a Hebrew family. <span class="cmt_word">Pharaoh's daughter said, "Take this child away, and nurse it for me</span>." "Take him with you - take him to your own home for a while - and there nurse him for me, as long as he needs nursing." And to mark that he is mine, and not yours - to silence inquiry - to stop the mouths of informers - "<span class="cmt_word">I will give thee thy wages</span>." Jochebed was more than content, and "<span class="cmt_word">took the child and nursed it</span>." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then his sister</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1465;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
