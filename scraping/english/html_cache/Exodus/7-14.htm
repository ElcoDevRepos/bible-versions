It underscores Moses' role as a prophet and mediator between God and the Israelites. This divine communication is foundational for the unfolding events in Exodus, as God provides guidance and instructions to Moses. The phrase also highlights the personal relationship between God and Moses, which is further emphasized in passages like <a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>, where it is said that the LORD spoke to Moses face to face.<p><b>Pharaoh&#8217;s heart is unyielding</b><br>The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a central theme in the Exodus narrative. It reflects the spiritual and moral obstinacy of Pharaoh, who is seen as a symbol of resistance against God's will. This hardening is both a divine act and a personal choice, illustrating the complex interplay between divine sovereignty and human responsibility. The unyielding heart of Pharaoh sets the stage for the plagues, which serve as judgments against Egypt's gods and demonstrate God's power. This theme is echoed in <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17-18</a>, where Paul discusses God's sovereignty in hardening whom He wills.<p><b>he refuses to let the people go</b><br>This refusal is a direct challenge to God's command and highlights Pharaoh's role as an antagonist in the narrative. The phrase underscores the central conflict of the Exodus story: the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. It also reflects the broader theme of deliverance and redemption that runs throughout the Bible, culminating in the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ. The repeated refusals of Pharaoh serve to magnify the eventual triumph of God's plan and the fulfillment of His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the nation of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is orchestrating the deliverance of His people from Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader and prophet of Israel, tasked with confronting Pharaoh and leading the Israelites out of bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened against the will of God, refusing to release the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, representing a place of oppression and idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are suffering under Egyptian bondage and awaiting deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>God's control over the events in Egypt demonstrates His ultimate authority over nations and rulers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_a_hardened_heart.htm">The Danger of a Hardened Heart</a></b><br>Pharaoh's stubbornness serves as a warning against resisting God's will and the consequences of a hardened heart.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience_and_justice.htm">God's Patience and Justice</a></b><br>Despite Pharaoh's repeated refusals, God gives multiple opportunities for repentance, showcasing His patience and justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_obedience_in_deliverance.htm">The Role of Obedience in Deliverance</a></b><br>Moses' obedience to God's command is crucial in the unfolding of God's plan for Israel's deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>The Israelites' situation reminds believers to trust in God's promises, even when circumstances seem dire.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_7_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 7:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Pharaoh_s_heart_Obedience_challenge.htm">How does Pharaoh's hardened heart in Exodus 7:14 challenge our obedience to God?

But the present miracle is different. (1) It is to be done on the largest possible scale; (2) in the sight of all the Egyptians; and (3) not as a sign, but as a "judgment." All the Nile water--whether in the main river, or its branches, or the canals derived from it, or the pools formed by its inundation or by percolation through its banks, or in artificial reservoirs, including the tanks of wood or stone attached to houses (<a href="/exodus/7-19.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand on the waters of Egypt, on their streams, on their rivers, and on their ponds, and on all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.">Exodus 7:19</a>)--is to be "turned to blood:" <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> not merely turned of a red colour, either by admixture of earthy matter or of <span class= "ital">Infusoriae,</span> but made to have all the qualities and appearance of blood, so as to become offensive, horrible, loathsome (<a href="/exodus/7-18.htm" title="And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river.">Exodus 7:18</a>). The judgment strikes the Egyptians two several blows. (1) It involves an insult to their religion, and brings it into discredit, since the Nile-god, Hapi, was a main object of worship, closely connected with Osiris, and even with Amnion, celebrated in hymns with the most extravagant titles of honour (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past,</span> vol. iv. pp. 108-110), and a frequent object of public adoration in festivals. (2) It is a great physical affliction. They are accustomed to use the Nile water for drinking, for ablutions, for the washing of their clothes, and for culinary purposes; they have great difficulty in procuring any other; they delight in the Nile water, regard it as the best in the world, are in the habit of drinking deep draughts of it continually. This is all put a stop to. They suffer from thirst, from enforced uncleanliness, from the horror of blood all about them, even in their cisterns. Again, their fish are killed. Fish was one of their principal foods, perhaps the main food of the common people; and the river was the chief source whence the fish supply was obtained, for even the Lake Moeris was an off-shoot from the river (Herod. ii. 149). Their fish supply is stopped. The punishment is retaliatory: for as they had made the Nile the means of destroying Hebrew infants (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm" title="And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.">Exodus 1:22</a>), so that Hebrew parents had loathed to drink of it, as though stained with the blood of their children, so is it now made by means of blood undrinkable for themselves. The plague lasts seven days (<a href="/exodus/7-25.htm" title="And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.">Exodus 7:25</a>), a longer time than any other; and if not so destructive as the later ones, was perhaps of all the most nauseous and disgusting. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-21.</span> - THE FIRST PLAGUE. The first miracle had been exhibited, and had failed. It had been a mere "sign," and in no respect a "judgment." Now the "judgments ' were to begin. God manifests himself again to Moses, and gives him exact directions what he is to do. He is to meet Pharaoh on the banks of the Nile, and to warn him that a plague is coming upon all Egypt on account of his obstinacy; that the waters of the Nile will be turned to blood, so that the ash will die, and the river stink, and the Egyptians loathe to drink of the water of the river (vers. 15-18). Pharaoh not yielding, making no sign, the threat is to be immediately followed by the act. In the sight of Pharaoh and his court, or at any rate of his train of attendants (ver. 20), Aaron is to stretch his rod over the Nile, and the water is at once to become blood, the fish to die, and the river in a short time to become offensive, or, in the simple and direct language of the Bible, to stink. The commands given by God are executed, and the result is as declared beforehand by Moses (vers. 20, 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pharaoh's heart is hardened</span>.
