In ancient Israel, livestock such as oxen, donkeys, and sheep were valuable assets, essential for agriculture and transportation. The law emphasizes restitution and justice, reflecting God's concern for fairness and the restoration of relationships. This principle of restitution is echoed in the New Testament, where Zacchaeus, upon his conversion, promises to repay fourfold anyone he has defrauded (<a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>).<p><b>whether ox or donkey or sheep&#8212;</b><br>These animals were central to the agrarian economy of ancient Israel. Oxen were used for plowing fields, donkeys for transportation, and sheep for wool and meat. The specific mention of these animals highlights their importance and the impact of their theft on a person's livelihood. The law's specificity underscores the need for justice in economic matters, a theme that runs throughout the Bible, including in the teachings of the prophets who often spoke against economic injustice (e.g., <a href="/amos/8-4.htm">Amos 8:4-6</a>).<p><b>he must pay back double.</b><br>The requirement to pay back double serves as both a deterrent to theft and a means of restitution. This principle of double restitution is part of the broader biblical theme of justice and restoration. It reflects God's character as just and merciful, ensuring that the victim is compensated while the offender is held accountable. This concept of restitution is seen in the New Testament as well, where believers are called to make amends and live righteously (<a href="/ephesians/4-28.htm">Ephesians 4:28</a>). The idea of paying back double can also be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He restores and reconciles humanity to God, offering more than what was lost through sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Exodus, who received the Law from God on Mount Sinai and delivered it to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the Law, God's chosen people, who were being formed into a nation with a distinct legal and moral code.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God gave the Law to Moses, including the civil and moral laws found in Exodus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/thief.htm">Thief</a></b><br>The individual who has stolen livestock and is subject to the restitution laws outlined in this passage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/livestock.htm">Livestock (Ox, Donkey, Sheep)</a></b><br>Common forms of wealth and livelihood in ancient Israel, representing significant economic value.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_restitution.htm">Principle of Restitution</a></b><br>The law requires not just the return of stolen property but additional compensation, highlighting the importance of justice and making amends.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_integrity.htm">Value of Integrity</a></b><br>This law underscores the value God places on honesty and integrity in personal and community relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The law serves to protect the community by deterring theft and ensuring that wrongs are righted, promoting social harmony.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice.htm">God's Justice</a></b><br>The requirement to repay double reflects God's justice, which is both corrective and restorative, aiming to restore relationships and trust.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/moral_accountability.htm">Moral Accountability</a></b><br>This passage reminds believers of their moral accountability before God and others, encouraging them to live righteously.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_22_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 22:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_4_s_role_in_restitution.htm">How does Exodus 22:4 emphasize the importance of restitution in Christian ethics?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_4_on_responsibility.htm">What does Exodus 22:4 teach about responsibility and accountability for one's actions?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Using_restitution_in_daily_relations.htm">How can we apply the principle of restitution in our daily relationships?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_4_Jesus_Forgiveness_link.htm">How does Exodus 22:4 connect with Jesus' teachings on forgiveness and reconciliation?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Exodus_22_4_resolve_conflicts.htm">In what ways can Exodus 22:4 guide us in resolving conflicts biblically?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_4_God_s_justice_in_property.htm">How does Exodus 22:4 reflect God's justice in property rights?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_4_insights_on_Israelite_values.htm">What does Exodus 22:4 reveal about ancient Israelite society and its values?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_4_s_modern_legal_relevance.htm">How should Exodus 22:4 be applied in modern legal systems?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_22.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_do_biblical_laws_mirror_hammurabi's.htm">Why do many biblical laws appear to be copied from earlier legal codes like the Code of Hammurabi?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_moses'_speech_traits.htm">Stephen states Moses was 'mighty in words' (Acts 7:22), but Exodus 4:10 depicts Moses as slow of speech.

If the thief still has the animal, he cannot claim ignorance or accidental involvement (<a href="/numbers/5-6.htm">Numbers 5:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The law therefore discourages hiding stolen goods; anyone caught red-handed faces immediate restitution (<a href="/job/20-18.htm">Job 20:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whether ox or donkey or sheep</b><p>By naming these three animals, the statute covers the main categories of livestock in agrarian Israel.<p>&#8226; Ox: essential for plowing and transport (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Donkey: everyday haulage and riding (<a href="/numbers/22-21.htm">Numbers 22:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Sheep: primary source of wool and meat (<a href="/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The list signals that no form of livestock theft is too small for God&#8217;s attention (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).
