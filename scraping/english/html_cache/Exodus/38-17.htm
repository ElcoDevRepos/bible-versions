The use of bronze for the bases of the posts in the tabernacle courtyard signifies a foundation of strength and durability. In the ancient Near East, bronze was a common material for tools and weapons, indicating its resilience. The tabernacle, as a place of worship and sacrifice, required a strong foundation, both physically and spiritually. The bronze bases may also remind us of the bronze altar, where sacrifices were made, pointing to the need for atonement and the judgment of sin.<p><b>the hooks and bands were silver</b><br>Silver in biblical symbolism often represents redemption and purity. The use of silver for the hooks and bands suggests the idea of connection and unity in the tabernacle's structure, as well as the purity required in approaching God. Silver was a valuable metal, indicating the preciousness of the tabernacle and its furnishings. In the context of the tabernacle, silver may also point to the redemption of the Israelites, as silver was used in the census offering (<a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>), symbolizing their atonement and belonging to God.<p><b>and the plating for the tops of the posts was silver</b><br>The silver plating on the tops of the posts adds a finishing touch of beauty and value, signifying the glory and holiness of the tabernacle. This detail highlights the importance of the tabernacle as a dwelling place for God's presence among His people. The use of silver at the top of the posts can be seen as a reflection of the heavenly, pointing upwards to God. It also serves as a reminder of the need for purity and redemption in the worship of God.<p><b>So all the posts of the courtyard were banded with silver</b><br>The banding of all the posts with silver creates a unified and cohesive structure, symbolizing the unity and order within the community of Israel as they worshiped God. This detail emphasizes the importance of holiness and redemption in every aspect of the tabernacle's construction. The consistent use of silver throughout the courtyard posts reflects the pervasive need for redemption and purity in the life of the Israelites. It also foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who purifies and unifies believers as the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary where God dwelled among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_courtyard.htm">The Courtyard</a></b><br>The outer area of the Tabernacle, enclosed by curtains and posts, where the altar of burnt offering and the bronze basin were located.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were commanded to construct the Tabernacle according to the divine specifications given to Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_materials.htm">Symbolism of Materials</a></b><br>Bronze often symbolizes judgment and strength, while silver represents redemption and purity.

In the wilderness sand, bronze resisted corrosion and supplied stability.<p>- Bronze elsewhere pictures righteous judgment:<p>&#8226; &#8220;You shall make&#8230; a bronze altar&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1&#8211;2</a>) where sin offerings were consumed.<p>&#8226; The bronze serpent lifted up for Israel&#8217;s healing (<a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>) typified sin judged.<p>&#8226; The glorified Christ appears with &#8220;feet like polished bronze refined in a furnace&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>).<p>- So, every boundary post of God&#8217;s dwelling rested on a foundation that spoke of judgment already borne. Only when sin is dealt with can fellowship begin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The hooks and bands were silver</b><p>- Hooks fastened the fine linen hangings (<a href="/exodus/26-32.htm">Exodus 26:32</a>; 38:10). Each was fashioned of silver, the metal Scripture links with purchase and redemption:<p>&#8226; At Sinai, every male Israelite paid &#8220;a half shekel according to the sanctuary shekel,&#8221; a silver ransom for his life (<a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph was sold for silver (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>); Jesus was betrayed for &#8220;thirty pieces of silver&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>), underscoring His role as the true ransom (<a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>).<p>- Practically, silver hooks held the white curtains secure; spiritually, redemption is what attaches a sinner to the righteous covering God provides.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The plating for the tops of the posts was silver</b><p>- Each capital&#8212; the exposed upper end of the post&#8212; was overlaid with silver (<a href="/exodus/38-28.htm">Exodus 38:28</a>). The courtyard border, viewed from above, gleamed with the color of redemption.<p>- The redeemed sinner is not only anchored on judgment-met (bronze) but also crowned with redemption-accomplished (silver). &#8220;You surround me with favor as with a shield&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/5-12.htm">Psalm 5:12</a>).<p>- Silver plating protected the wood beneath, a picture of how God&#8217;s saving work both beautifies and preserves the worshiper (Jude 24).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So all the posts of the courtyard were banded with silver</b><p>- A silver band (ring or fillet) encircled every post (<a href="/exodus/27-17.htm">Exodus 27:17</a>). Nothing in God&#8217;s house stood bare of redemption.<p>- The repeated silver announces equality: every approach point to God bore the same testimony&#8212;salvation is wholly of Him, never of human merit (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p>- Those united to Christ form &#8220;one new man&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>). The encircling bands hint that shared redemption binds God&#8217;s people together at the very border of His dwelling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/38-17.htm">Exodus 38:17</a> records literal building details, yet each material carries deliberate meaning. The bronze bases proclaim judgment satisfied; the silver hooks, bands, and caps proclaim redemption secured.
