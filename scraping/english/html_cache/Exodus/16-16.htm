The LORD's commands are central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel. In the context of Exodus, God is establishing His laws and guidelines for the Israelites, who are learning to trust and obey Him after their deliverance from Egypt. This command is part of God's provision and care for His people, teaching them reliance on Him.<p><b>Each one is to gather as much as he needs:</b><br>This instruction highlights God's provision and the principle of sufficiency. It reflects the idea that God provides for the needs of His people, not their greed. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches His disciples to pray for "our daily bread" (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>), emphasizing trust in God's daily provision. The gathering of manna is a test of obedience and faith, as the Israelites must trust that God will provide enough for each day.<p><b>You may take an omer for each person in your tent:</b><br>An omer is a unit of measure, approximately 2 quarts or 2 liters. This specific measurement ensures that each person receives an adequate portion, reflecting God's fairness and order. The mention of "each person in your tent" underscores the communal aspect of God's provision, as families are to gather according to their needs. This mirrors the communal sharing seen in the early church, where believers shared resources so that no one was in need (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-35</a>). The manna also serves as a type of Christ, the Bread of Life, who satisfies the spiritual hunger of all who come to Him (<a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_sin.htm">The Wilderness of Sin</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites are currently encamped, a place of testing and provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who provides for His people and gives them instructions for living.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/manna.htm">Manna</a></b><br>The miraculous bread from heaven provided by God to sustain the Israelites in the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>God provides for our needs, not our greeds.
