The twenty posts here refer to the structural supports for the courtyard's outer hangings. This number signifies completeness and order, aligning with the biblical theme of God's perfect design. The posts were likely made of acacia wood, a durable material common in the Sinai region, symbolizing strength and resilience.<p><b>and twenty bronze bases</b><br>Bronze, a metal alloy of copper and tin, was used for the bases, indicating durability and stability. In biblical symbolism, bronze often represents judgment and endurance. The use of bronze for the bases suggests a foundation that withstands trials, paralleling the steadfastness required of God's people. The bases provided a firm grounding for the posts, ensuring the courtyard's structure was secure.<p><b>and with silver hooks and bands on the posts</b><br>Silver in the Bible often symbolizes redemption and purity. The use of silver hooks and bands signifies the connection and unity of the Tabernacle's structure, reflecting the redeemed community of believers. The hooks and bands held the linen hangings in place, representing the binding of God's covenant with His people. This imagery points to the New Testament, where believers are described as being "built together" in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-22.htm">Ephesians 2:22</a>), highlighting the unity and purity found in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_courtyard.htm">The Courtyard</a></b><br>The outer area of the Tabernacle, enclosed by curtains supported by posts, where the altar of burnt offering and the bronze basin were located.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who contributed materials and labor for the construction of the Tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The detailed construction of the Tabernacle, including the posts and bases, highlights the importance of following God's instructions precisely.
