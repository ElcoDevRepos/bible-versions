The "LORD's glory" often signifies His presence and divine intervention. In the context of the Israelites' journey, it underscores God's continual guidance and provision. The glory of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often associated with His presence in the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>) and later in the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). This manifestation of glory prefigures the ultimate revelation of God's glory in Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word becomes flesh and dwells among us, and we behold His glory.<p><b>because He has heard your grumbling against Him</b><br>The Israelites' grumbling highlights their lack of faith and trust in God's provision, despite witnessing numerous miracles, such as the parting of the Red Sea. This grumbling is a recurring issue throughout their wilderness journey (<a href="/numbers/14-27.htm">Numbers 14:27</a>). It serves as a reminder of human nature's tendency to doubt and complain, even in the face of divine intervention. God's response to their grumbling is not one of immediate judgment but of provision, demonstrating His patience and mercy. This foreshadows the New Testament teaching of God's grace, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>, where God demonstrates His love for us even while we are still sinners.<p><b>For who are we, that you should grumble against us?&#8221;</b><br>Moses and Aaron, as leaders, deflect the complaints of the Israelites, emphasizing that their grumbling is ultimately against God, not them. This statement reflects the humility of Moses and Aaron, recognizing their roles as instruments of God's will rather than the source of provision. It also serves as a reminder that leaders are often the target of dissatisfaction, but the true issue lies in the people's relationship with God. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where leaders are called to serve as stewards of God's mysteries (<a href="/1_corinthians/4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>) and to lead with humility, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness.

After wrestling all night, Jacob meets God&#8217;s blessing &#8220;as the sun rose&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-31.htm">Genesis 32:31</a>). The women encounter the risen Christ &#8220;at dawn&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1</a>).<p>- Here, the night of grumbling will give way to dawn filled with provision, underscoring <a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>: &#8220;Weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will see the LORD&#8217;s glory</b><p>- &#8220;Glory&#8221; (k&#257;&#7687;&#333;d) signals God&#8217;s visible splendor&#8212;cloud, fire, unmistakable presence (<a href="/exodus/16-10.htm">Exodus 16:10</a>; 24:16-17).<p>- Israel, fresh out of Egypt, still needs convincing that Yahweh is both their Redeemer (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30-31</a>) and Sustainer (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>).<p>- The promise guarantees an encounter, not merely information. Like Isaiah, they will behold holiness and be humbled (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>); like the shepherds at Bethlehem, they will be both awed and assured (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because He has heard your grumbling against Him</b><p>- God listens&#8212;even to complaints (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>). Yet grumbling reveals distrust. <a href="/numbers/14-27.htm">Numbers 14:27</a> records the Lord asking, &#8220;How long will this wicked community grumble against Me?&#8221;<p>- His response is grace before judgment. Instead of striking the people, He supplies manna (<a href="/exodus/16-12.htm">Exodus 16:12-15</a>), echoing Jesus&#8217; future offer, &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32-35</a>).<p>- The hearing ear of God invites honest cries (<a href="/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>), but it also calls for repentant hearts (<a href="/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For who are we</b><p>- Moses and Aaron step out of the spotlight, directing honor upward. Like John the Baptist&#8212;&#8220;He must increase, I must decrease&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>)&#8212;they refuse misplaced veneration.<p>- Leaders serve as channels, not sources. Paul echoes this humility: &#8220;What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5</a>).<p>- Proper perspective guards against idolizing human instruments and keeps the congregation&#8217;s focus on God alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that you should grumble against us?</b><p>- The complaint feels horizontal, yet its true target is vertical. Rejecting God-appointed leaders equals resisting God Himself (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>).<p>- Grumbling spreads like leaven (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>) and fractures fellowship. <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a> urges believers to submit joyfully &#8220;so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you.&#8221;<p>- By exposing the misdirected grumbling, Moses educates Israel: their issue is with the Provider, not the middlemen. Recognition of this fact is the first step toward repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/16-7.htm">Exodus 16:7</a> assures Israel that at daybreak they will witness tangible evidence of God&#8217;s majesty, confirming He hears every word&#8212;even complaints. The promise of glory is tied directly to grace: instead of punishing grumblers, He feeds them. Moses and Aaron deflect attention from themselves, reminding the people that their protests are ultimately against the Lord. The passage calls believers to trade grumbling for gratitude, trust morning mercies, and keep their eyes fixed on the One whose glory satisfies every need.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the Lord.</span>--The reference here is to the manna, which "in the morning lay round about the host" (<a href="/exodus/16-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.">Exodus 16:13</a>), not to the "appearance" of <a href="/exodus/16-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.">Exodus 16:10</a>, which preceded the coming of the quails, and was not--as far as we are told--"in the morning." The "glory of God" was strikingly revealed in a gift which was not transient, but secured permanently the subsistence of the people so long as it might be necessary for them to continue in the wilderness. (Comp. the parallelism of <a href="/exodus/16-8.htm" title="And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD hears your murmurings which you murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.">Exodus 16:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/16-12.htm" title="I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak to them, saying, At even you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God.">Exodus 16:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> ? <span class="cmt_word">And in the morning then ye shall see the glory of the Lord</span>. This has been supposed to refer to the manifestation of God's presence recorded in verse 10; but the balance of the two clauses in verses 6 and 7 implies two <span class="cmt_word">similar</span> manifestations, and their arrangement shows the priority of the evening one. Now the manifestation of verse 10 preceded the coming of the quails. The manifestation which followed it, which was similar, and in the morning, was the fall of the manna. <span class="cmt_word">For that he heareth your murmurings</span>. The connection of this clause with the preceding furnishes an additional argument in favour of the exposition that "the glory of God," spoken of in this verse is the manna. <span class="cmt_word">Against the Lord</span>.
