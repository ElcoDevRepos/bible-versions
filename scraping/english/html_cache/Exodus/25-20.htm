In biblical context, cherubim are guardians of sacred spaces, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, where they guard the way to the Tree of Life. The upward spread of their wings signifies their role in elevating the holiness of the Ark of the Covenant, which they are commanded to protect. This imagery also reflects the heavenly nature of the cherubim, as they are often seen in visions of God's throne, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5-11</a>.<p><b>overshadowing the mercy seat</b><br>The mercy seat, or "kapporet" in Hebrew, is the cover of the Ark of the Covenant and represents the throne of God on earth. The cherubim's wings overshadowing the mercy seat indicate God's presence and protection over His covenant with Israel. This imagery is significant in the Day of Atonement rituals described in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, where the high priest would sprinkle blood on the mercy seat to atone for the sins of the people, symbolizing God's mercy and forgiveness. The overshadowing wings also prefigure the New Testament concept of God's grace through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the ultimate mercy seat (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>), offering atonement for humanity's sins.<p><b>The cherubim are to face each other</b><br>The positioning of the cherubim facing each other emphasizes unity and harmony in the divine presence. This arrangement suggests a continuous watchfulness and readiness to serve God, reflecting the cherubim's role as guardians of His holiness. The facing cherubim also symbolize the relational aspect of God's covenant, as they are positioned over the mercy seat where God would meet with Moses (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). This face-to-face orientation can be seen as a type of the intimate relationship between God and His people, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through the person of Jesus Christ, who reconciles humanity to God.<p><b>looking toward the mercy seat</b><br>The cherubim's gaze toward the mercy seat signifies their focus on God's presence and the centrality of His mercy in the covenant relationship with Israel. This focus highlights the importance of the mercy seat as the place where God would communicate with His people, as described in <a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>. The cherubim's attention to the mercy seat underscores the theme of divine mercy and judgment, as the mercy seat is both a place of atonement and a symbol of God's righteous rule. In Christian theology, this foreshadows the role of Jesus Christ as the mediator between God and humanity, who embodies God's mercy and provides access to His presence (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings often associated with the presence of God.

Compare <a href="/exodus/37-9.htm">Exodus 37:9</a>. It would seem that the two wings of both cherubs were advanced in front of them, and elevated, so as to overshadow the mercy seat. This was a departure from the patterns furnished by the figures of Ma (see the comment on ver. 18), since in them one wing only was elevated, and the other depressed. It is clear that in no case was any part of the Hebrew sacred furniture a mere reproduction of Egyptian models. Whatever was made use of was so transformed or modified as to acquire a new and independent character. <span class="cmt_word">Their faces</span>, etc. The words are not without difficulty; but the generally received meaning appears to be correct that the faces were bent one towards the other, but that both looked downwards, towards the mercy seat. Thus the figures, whether they were standing or kneeling, which is uncertain, presented the appearance of guardian angels, who watched over the precious deposit below - to wit, the two tables. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/25-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The cherubim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1467;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#601;&#183;ru&#183;&#7687;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
