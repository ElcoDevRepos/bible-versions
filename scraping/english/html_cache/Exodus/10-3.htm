This reflects the biblical theme of God using chosen individuals to convey His will. Their repeated visits to Pharaoh demonstrate God's patience and the opportunity for repentance. Historically, Pharaohs were seen as divine figures in Egyptian culture, making this confrontation a direct challenge to Pharaoh's perceived divinity.<p><b>&#8220;This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says:</b><br>The use of "LORD" (YHWH) emphasizes the covenantal name of God, highlighting His relationship with the Israelites. By identifying as the "God of the Hebrews," it distinguishes the God of Israel from the pantheon of Egyptian deities, asserting His supremacy. This phrase underscores the personal and national identity of the Israelites as God's chosen people.<p><b>&#8216;How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me?</b><br>This question challenges Pharaoh's pride and stubbornness, a recurring theme in the narrative. Humility before God is a central biblical principle, contrasting with Pharaoh's hard-heartedness. The call to humility is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>, which emphasizes the importance of submitting to God's authority.<p><b>Let My people go,</b><br>This command is a central motif in the Exodus narrative, representing God's demand for the liberation of His people. It signifies God's power to deliver and His commitment to His promises. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance found in Christ, who frees believers from the bondage of sin.<p><b>so that they may worship Me.</b><br>The purpose of liberation is not merely freedom from oppression but freedom to serve and worship God. Worship is a fundamental aspect of the Israelites' identity and relationship with God. This reflects the broader biblical theme that true freedom is found in serving God, as seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are called to offer themselves as living sacrifices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.
