The "wilderness" refers to the desert regions east of Egypt, a challenging terrain that required divine guidance. The route through the wilderness was not the most direct path to Canaan, but it was chosen by God to avoid immediate conflict with the Philistines (<a href="/exodus/13-17.htm">Exodus 13:17</a>). The "Red Sea" is traditionally understood as the body of water the Israelites would miraculously cross, symbolizing deliverance and foreshadowing baptism (<a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>). This journey through the wilderness also serves as a period of testing and preparation for the Israelites, paralleling Jesus' time in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<p><b>And the Israelites left the land of Egypt arrayed for battle.</b><br>The phrase "arrayed for battle" suggests that the Israelites were organized and prepared, though they were not yet a trained military force. This preparation indicates a readiness to follow God's commands and face future challenges. The departure from Egypt marks the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>) and the beginning of the nation's journey to the Promised Land. The imagery of being "arrayed for battle" also points to the spiritual battles believers face, with God as their leader and protector (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine leader and guide of the Israelites, orchestrating their journey from Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, who were enslaved in Egypt and are now being led to freedom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area through which God led the Israelites, symbolizing a place of testing and reliance on God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>A significant body of water that the Israelites would miraculously cross, marking a pivotal moment in their exodus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which the Israelites are being delivered.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_guidance.htm">Divine Guidance</a></b><br>Trust in God's leading, even when the path seems indirect or challenging.

Every detail testifies to His sovereign wisdom and unfailing care, inviting us to trust His guidance even when the road seems longer, harder, or impossible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">But God led the people about.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">led the people a circuit</span>--took them, not by the direct route, through Pelusium, past Lake Serbonis, to Rhinocolura and Gaza, but led them by the most circuitous route possible--the way of the Red Sea and the wilderness of Sinai to the Transjordanic region, the land of the Amorites, and so across Jordan to Canaan proper. The passage seems to dispose altogether of Dr. Brugsch's theory, that the "Red Sea" of the writer of Exodus was the Lake Serbonis, and that it was not until after this lake was passed that their journey was deflected to the south.<p><span class= "bld">The children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.</span>--It is generally agreed that this is a wrong translation. Very few of the Israelites can have possessed suits of armour until after the passage of the Red Sea, when they may have stripped the bodies of the slain Egyptians. Nor has the word used ever the force of "harnessed." It might mean "with their loins girded," but such an exposition would deprive the statement made of any force. Loins were always girded in preparation for a journey, and there would be no need to mention the fact. The best explanation is, that the word here means "organised," "in military order" (Saadia, Gesenius, Lee, Knobel, Cook). It was clearly necessary, to prevent confusion, that a military order should have been adopted, and there are not wanting indications that during the year of contention with Pharaoh such an organisation was introduced and proceeded with. (See <a href="/exodus/4-29.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:">Exodus 4:29</a>; <a href="/exodus/4-31.htm" title="And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked on their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.">Exodus 4:31</a>; <a href="/exodus/6-26.htm" title="These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.">Exodus 6:26</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-3.htm" title="Speak you to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:">Exodus 12:3</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-21.htm" title="Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.">Exodus 12:21</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-51.htm" title="And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.">Exodus 12:51</a>.) It must have been brought to a high pitch of perfection for the Exodus to have taken place, as it seems to have done, without serious confusion or entanglement. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God led the people about</span>. Or "led the people a circuit," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">made</span> them take a circuitous route to Canaan, <span class="cmt_word">the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by the southern wilderness, or what is now called "the wilderness of Sinai." Kalisch shows the wisdom of this course - how it gave time for the nation to be "gradually accustomed to fatigues and hardships by a long and tiresome march in the desert" - to learn obedience to their chief - and finally to be "trained to military discipline and martial, virtue by occasional expeditions against the weaker tribes of the desert." He errs, however, in ascribing the wisdom of the course taken to Moses, since Moses expressly declares that the conception was not his, but God's. <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Israel went up harnessed</span>. The word here translated "harnessed," is generally thought to mean either "with their loins girded" (Onkelos, Kimchi, Kalisch) or "in military order" (Gesenius, Lee, Knobel). Ewald, who inclines to the latter of these two senses, suggests that, strictly, it means "in five divisions" - viz., van, centre, two wings, and rearguard. The word is, apparently, a derivative from <span class="accented">khamesh</span>, "five." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/13-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;&#1501;
