In the context of Exodus, Moses often serves as the intermediary between God and the Israelites, conveying divine instructions. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's leadership during the wilderness period.<p><b>&#8216;Tomorrow is to be a day of complete rest,</b><br>The concept of rest is rooted in the creation narrative where God rested on the seventh day (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). This establishes a pattern for the Israelites, highlighting the importance of rest as a divine ordinance. It also serves as a reminder of God's provision and sovereignty, teaching reliance on Him rather than on human effort.<p><b>a holy Sabbath to the LORD.</b><br>The Sabbath is set apart as holy, indicating its sanctity and dedication to God. This day is not merely for physical rest but is a spiritual observance, a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>). It foreshadows the ultimate rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>), who fulfills the law and offers spiritual rest to believers.<p><b>So bake what you want to bake, and boil what you want to boil.</b><br>This instruction allows for preparation before the Sabbath, ensuring that the day remains free from labor. It reflects the practical aspects of observing the Sabbath, where necessary work is completed in advance. This preparation underscores the importance of intentionality in worship and rest.<p><b>Then set aside whatever remains and keep it until morning.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This directive ensures that the Israelites have enough provision for the Sabbath without gathering manna on that day. It demonstrates God's miraculous provision, as the manna would not spoil overnight on this occasion, unlike other days (<a href="/exodus/16-19.htm">Exodus 16:19-20</a>).

The absence of the article indicates that it is a new thing which is announced--if not absolutely, at any rate to those to whom the announcement is made. Much, no doubt, may be said in favour of a primaeval institution of the Sabbath (see the comment on <a href="/context/genesis/2-2.htm" title="And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.">Genesis 2:2-3</a>); and its observance in a certain sense by the Babylonians (see the first Note on <a href="/exodus/16-5.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.">Exodus 16:5</a>) is in favour of its having been known to the family of Abraham; but during the Egyptian oppression the continued observance would have been impossible, and the surprise of the elders, as well as the words of Moses, show that at this time the idea was, to the Israelites, practically a novelty.<p><span class= "bld">Bake . . .
