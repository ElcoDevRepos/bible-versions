The entrance symbolizes access to God and His holiness, where only the consecrated priests could perform their duties. This setting underscores the sacredness of the ritual and the importance of approaching God with reverence and obedience.<p><b>Aaron and his sons</b><br>Aaron, the brother of Moses, was appointed as the first high priest, and his sons were designated as priests. This priestly lineage was established by God to mediate between Him and the people of Israel. The role of the priests was crucial in maintaining the covenant relationship, and their consecration was necessary for the proper worship and service in the Tabernacle. This priesthood is a type of the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who mediates the new covenant.<p><b>are to eat the meat of the ram</b><br>The eating of the sacrificial meat was part of the ordination ceremony for the priests. This act signified their participation in the sacrificial system and their acceptance of the responsibilities of the priesthood. The ram was a symbol of substitutionary atonement, pointing forward to Christ, the Lamb of God, who would take away the sins of the world. The consumption of the meat also indicated the priests' sustenance and dependence on God's provision.<p><b>and the bread that is in the basket</b><br>The bread, likely unleavened, was part of the offerings presented during the ordination. Bread in biblical times was a staple food, symbolizing life and sustenance. In the context of the priestly ordination, it represented the priests' dedication to God and their reliance on Him for spiritual nourishment. This foreshadows the bread of life, Jesus Christ, who provides eternal sustenance to believers. The inclusion of bread in the ritual highlights the holistic provision of God for both physical and spiritual needs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, appointed as the first high priest of Israel.
