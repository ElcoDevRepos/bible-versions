The locust plague was the eighth of the ten plagues God sent to persuade Pharaoh to release the Israelites from slavery. The imagery of the land turning black emphasizes the sheer density of the locust swarm, which blocked out the sunlight. In the ancient Near East, locust plagues were feared for their destructive power, as they could devastate crops and lead to famine. This event demonstrates God's control over nature and His ability to use it as a tool for judgment.<p><b>and they consumed all the plants on the ground and all the fruit on the trees that the hail had left behind</b><br>The locusts devoured everything that the previous plague of hail had not destroyed. This highlights the cumulative nature of the plagues, each one compounding the devastation of the last. The hail had already damaged the barley and flax crops, and now the locusts finished off what remained. This relentless destruction served to demonstrate the futility of resisting God's will. The locusts' consumption of the plants and fruit also symbolizes the stripping away of Egypt's resources and prosperity, a direct challenge to the Egyptian gods associated with fertility and agriculture.<p><b>Nothing green was left on any tree or plant in all the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of the destruction. The complete absence of greenery signifies not only physical desolation but also spiritual barrenness. In biblical symbolism, green often represents life and vitality, so its absence suggests a land under judgment and devoid of blessing. This devastation would have had severe economic and social implications for Egypt, leading to food shortages and economic collapse. The thoroughness of the locusts' destruction also prefigures the comprehensive nature of God's deliverance of His people, as He leaves no part of their bondage unaddressed. This event foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who brings complete salvation and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

"It is sufficient," observes a traveller in Spain, "if these terrible columns stop half an hour on a spot, for everything growing on it--vines, olive-trees, and corn--to be entirely destroyed. After they have passed, nothing remains but the large branches and the roots, which, being underground, have escaped their voracity."<p><span class= "bld">All the fruit of the trees.</span>--Egypt was famous for its fruits, which consisted of figs, grapes, olives, mulberries, pomegranates, dates, pears, plums, apples, peaches, and the produce of the <span class= "ital">persea,</span> and the <span class= "ital">nebk,</span> or <span class= "ital">sidr.</span> The fruit of the <span class= "ital">nebk</span> would be ripe in March, and the blossom-buds of the other fruit-trees would be formed, or even opening. On the damage which locusts do to fruit-trees, see the comment on <a href="/exodus/10-5.htm" title="And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field:">Exodus 10:5</a>, and add the following:--"When the weeds in the vineyards do not supply them with sufficient nutriment, they completely strip the bark and buds off the young twigs, so that these shoots remain throughout the summer as white as chalk, without producing fresh foliage" (Pallas, <span class= "ital">Travels,</span> vol. ii., p. 425).<p><span class= "bld">Which the hail had left.</span>--See <a href="/exodus/9-25.htm" title="And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.">Exodus 9:25</a>, and comp. <a href="/context/psalms/105-32.htm" title="He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.">Psalm 105:32-33</a> :--"He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land; he smote their vines also, and their fig trees, and brake the trees of their coasts." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The land was darkened</span>. It is not quite clear whether the darkness here spoken of was caused by the locusts when they were still on the wing or after they had settled. It is a fact that the insects come in such dense clouds that while on the wing they obscure the light of the sun, and turn noonday into twilight. And it is also a fact that with their dull brownish bodies and wings they darken the ground after they have settled. Perhaps it is most probable that this last is the fact noticed. (Compare ver. 5.) <span class="cmt_word">All the fruit of the trees which the hail had left</span>. Injury to fruit by the hail had not been expressly mentioned in the account of that plague, though perhaps it may be regarded as implied in the expression - that the hail "brake every tree of the field" (ver. 25). The damage which locusts do to fruit is well known. They devour it with the green crops, the herbage, and the foliage, before setting to work upon the harder materials, as reeds, twigs, and the bark of trees. In Egypt the principal fruits would be figs, pomegranates; mulberries, grapes, olives, peaches, pears, plums, and apples; together with dates, and the produce of <span class="accented">the persea</span>, and the <span class="accented">nebk</span> or <span class="accented">sidr</span>. The fruit of the <span class="accented">nebk</span> is ripe in March. <span class="cmt_word">There remained not any green thing</span>. "It is sufficient," observes one writer, "if these terrible columns stop half an hour on a spot, for everything growing on it, vines, olive-trees, and corn, to be entirely destroyed. After they have passed, nothing remains but the large branches and the roots, which, being underground, have escaped their voracity." "Where<span class="accented">-</span>ever they settle," says another, "it looks as if fire had burnt up everything." "The country did not seem to be burnt," declares a third, "but to be covered with snow, through the whiteness of the trees and the dryness of the herbs." A fourth sums up his account of the ravages committed by locusts thus - "According to all accounts, wherever the swarms of locusts arrive, the vegetables are entirely consumed and destroyed, appearing as if they had been burnt by fire." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/10-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They covered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1438;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7733;as)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
