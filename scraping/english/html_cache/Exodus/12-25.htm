Historically, this event occurs after the Exodus from Egypt and the subsequent 40 years of wandering in the desert. The land is described as "flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>), symbolizing abundance and blessing. The entry into the land is a fulfillment of God's promise to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>that the LORD will give you</b><br>The land is a divine gift from the LORD, emphasizing God's sovereignty and faithfulness. This promise is rooted in the Abrahamic Covenant (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>), where God pledged to give Abraham's descendants the land of Canaan. The giving of the land is not based on Israel's merit but on God's grace and covenantal faithfulness.<p><b>as He promised</b><br>This highlights the reliability and trustworthiness of God's word. The promise of the land is reiterated throughout the Pentateuch, including in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a> and <a href="/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>. It underscores the theme of God's faithfulness to His promises, a central tenet in the biblical narrative.<p><b>you are to keep this service</b><br>The "service" refers to the observance of the Passover, a perpetual ordinance for the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>). This observance serves as a memorial of God's deliverance from Egypt and a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrificial death, as the Passover lamb is a type of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). The keeping of this service is an act of obedience and remembrance, reinforcing the covenant relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were enslaved in Egypt and are being led to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who promises to deliver the Israelites and give them the land of Canaan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants as an everlasting possession.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_passover.htm">The Passover</a></b><br>The service or ritual that the Israelites are commanded to keep, commemorating their deliverance from Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage and guide them to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god's_promises.htm">Faithfulness to God's Promises</a></b><br>God is faithful to fulfill His promises, as seen in His deliverance of the Israelites and the giving of the Promised Land.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/importance_of_remembrance.htm">Importance of Remembrance</a></b><br>The command to keep the Passover serves as a reminder of God's deliverance and faithfulness.
