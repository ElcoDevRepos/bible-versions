Their wings spreading upward signifies their readiness to serve and their connection to the divine realm. In the context of the Tabernacle, this imagery emphasizes the heavenly nature of the Ark of the Covenant. The upward spread of the wings also symbolizes the cherubim's role in worship and adoration of God, reflecting the heavenly worship described in <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>.<p><b>overshadowing the mercy seat</b><br>The mercy seat, or "atonement cover," was the lid of the Ark of the Covenant, where God's presence would appear. The cherubim overshadowing the mercy seat signifies protection and the sacredness of this space. This imagery connects to the concept of God's throne, as seen in <a href="/psalms/99.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>, where God is enthroned between the cherubim. The mercy seat is central to the Day of Atonement rituals (Leviticus 16), prefiguring Christ's atoning sacrifice (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>), where He becomes the ultimate mercy seat for believers.<p><b>The cherubim faced each other</b><br>The positioning of the cherubim facing each other suggests a unity and harmony in their purpose, reflecting the divine order and the cooperative nature of God's creation. This orientation also indicates their focus on the mercy seat, symbolizing the centrality of God's presence and the importance of atonement. The facing cherubim can be seen as a representation of the heavenly host's agreement and participation in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>looking toward the mercy seat</b><br>The cherubim's gaze toward the mercy seat highlights the significance of this location as the focal point of God's presence and interaction with His people. It underscores the importance of atonement and reconciliation with God, as the mercy seat was where the high priest would sprinkle the blood of the sacrifice, symbolizing the covering of sin. This anticipates the New Testament revelation of Jesus as the mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>), where He fulfills the role of both high priest and sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings often associated with the presence of God.

Angels rejoice over one sinner who repents (<a href="/luke/15-10.htm">Luke 15:10</a>), and here they continually attend the place where atonement is made.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a> reiterates this posture, indicating that the pattern did not change from design to construction&#8212;a reminder that God&#8217;s directions are not suggestions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Looking toward the mercy seat</b><p>Scripture repeats the point so we will not miss it: their eyes are fixed on mercy.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a> notes that &#8220;even angels long to look into these things,&#8221; namely the gospel&#8212;precisely what the mercy seat prefigures.<p>&#8226; The cherubim&#8217;s steady gaze invites worshipers to share their focus; <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a> tells believers to fix our eyes on Jesus, the ultimate fulfillment of the mercy seat.<p>&#8226; Their posture also conveys expectancy; every Day of Atonement they &#8220;watched,&#8221; as it were, for the blood to be applied. This anticipates Calvary, where Christ&#8217;s blood was offered once for all (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p>&#8226; By directing all attention toward the center, God teaches His people that every blessing&#8212;guidance, provision, protection&#8212;flows from His pardoning grace concentrated at that golden lid.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/37-9.htm">Exodus 37:9</a> uses the careful crafting of two golden cherubim to portray heaven&#8217;s unbroken attention to God&#8217;s redemptive plan. Wings lifted upward show readiness to serve; wings spread downward provide shelter over the place of atonement. Faces turned inward express unified worship; eyes fixed on the mercy seat highlight the centrality of grace.
