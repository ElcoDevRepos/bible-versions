The Tabernacle was a portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, and its design was given directly by God to Moses. The curtains served as a boundary, separating the sacred space from the common. This separation underscores the holiness of God and the need for purity when approaching Him. The use of curtains instead of solid walls allowed for portability, reflecting the Israelites' nomadic lifestyle during their wilderness journey.<p><b>fifteen cubits long</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Therefore, fifteen cubits would be approximately 22.5 feet or 6.75 meters. The specific dimensions of the Tabernacle and its courtyard were divinely ordained, emphasizing order and precision in worship. The number fifteen, while not as symbolically significant as other numbers in the Bible, contributes to the overall symmetry and balance of the Tabernacle's design.<p><b>with three posts and three bases</b><br>The posts and bases provided structural support for the curtains. The use of three posts and bases on this side of the courtyard may symbolize completeness or divine perfection, as the number three often represents in biblical numerology (e.g., the Trinity). The materials for the posts and bases, typically bronze or silver, were chosen for their durability and symbolic value, with bronze often representing judgment and silver redemption. The construction details highlight the importance of stability and strength in the structure that housed the presence of God, pointing to the enduring nature of His covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the Tabernacle from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where these specific instructions for its construction were given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_courtyard.htm">The Courtyard</a></b><br>The area surrounding the Tabernacle, enclosed by curtains, where the altar of burnt offering and the bronze basin were located.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were to construct the Tabernacle according to the divine instructions given to Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites were journeying and where the Tabernacle was to be set up.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/attention_to_detail_in_worship.htm">Attention to Detail in Worship</a></b><br>The specific measurements and materials for the Tabernacle highlight the importance of following God's instructions precisely.
