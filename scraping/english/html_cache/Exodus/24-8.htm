The act of taking the blood signifies the preparation for a sacred ritual. Blood was often used in sacrifices to atone for sin and to consecrate people or objects to God. This act by Moses is a precursor to the sacrificial system that would be established in the Levitical laws.<p><b>splattered it on the people</b><br>The splattering of blood on the people signifies their participation in the covenant with God. It is a physical representation of their commitment and consecration to the LORD. This act can be seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing purification and dedication. It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of being covered by the blood of Christ for the forgiveness of sins.<p><b>and said, &#8220;This is the blood of the covenant</b><br>The phrase "blood of the covenant" is significant in biblical theology. It establishes a binding agreement between God and His people, sealed with blood. This covenant is reminiscent of ancient Near Eastern treaties, where blood rituals were common. It also points forward to the New Covenant in Christ's blood, as mentioned in the Gospels during the Last Supper (e.g., <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>).<p><b>that the LORD has made with you</b><br>This emphasizes that the covenant is initiated by God, not by the people. It is a divine act of grace and commitment. The LORD's making of the covenant highlights His sovereignty and faithfulness. This covenant is part of the larger narrative of God's redemptive plan, beginning with Abraham and continuing through the history of Israel.<p><b>in accordance with all these words.&#8221;</b><br>The words refer to the laws and commandments given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai, which are detailed in the preceding chapters. This underscores the importance of obedience to God's word as part of the covenant relationship. It also highlights the comprehensive nature of the covenant, encompassing both moral and ceremonial aspects of the law. This anticipates the fulfillment of the law through Christ, who perfectly obeyed and fulfilled all righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses acts as the mediator between God and the Israelites.

Moses, acting as mediator, takes sacrificial blood&#8212;symbolizing life given&#8212;and sprinkles it first on the altar, then on the people, visibly uniting God and Israel. His declaration, &#8220;This is the blood of the covenant,&#8221; underscores that only through shed blood can sinful people enter fellowship with a holy God. The scene anticipates the ultimate covenant sealed by Christ&#8217;s blood, where He fulfills and transcends the Mosaic pattern, offering permanent atonement and calling His people to loving obedience to &#8220;all these words.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it . . . --</span>Half of the blood had been sprinkled upon the altar, which symbolised Jehovah; the other half was now sprinkled upon the people, or rather upon their representatives--the elders and others who stood nearest to Moses. Thus the two parties to the covenant, sprinkled with the blood of the same sacrifices, were brought into sacramental union. Rites somewhat similar, involving blood communion, were common throughout the East in connection with covenants (Horn. <span class= "ital">Il. iii.</span> 298, xix. 252; Herod. I. 74, iii. 8, iv. 70; Xen. <span class= "ital">Anab. ii.</span> 2, ? 9; Lucian. <span class= "ital">Toxar. </span>37; Pomp. <span class= "ital">Mel. </span>ii. 1; Tac. <span class= "ital">Ann. xii.</span> 47; &c), and were regarded as adding to their force and sacredness.<p><span class= "bld">On the people.</span>--It has been suggested (Abarbarnel) that the blood was really sprinkled on the twelve pillars which represented the people; but the words used scarcely seem to admit of such an interpretation. The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews understood the passage as declaring that the people were sprinkled (<a href="/hebrews/9-19.htm" title="For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,">Hebrews 9:19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Moses then proceeded to the final act - He took the blood from the basins, <span class="cmt_word">and sprinkled it</span> - not certainly upon all the people, who numbered above two millions - but upon their leaders and representatives, the "elders" and other chief men, drawn up at the head of each tribe, and thus brought within his reach. It has been supposed by some that he merely sprinkled the blood on the twelve pillars, as representing the twelve tribes; but, had this been the case, the expression in the text would probably have been different. We read, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, that he "sprinkled both the book, <span class="accented">and all the people"</span> (<a href="/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a>). As he sprinkled, he said, <span class="cmt_word">Behold the blood of the covenant</span>, etc. It was a common practice among the nations of antiquity to seal covenants with blood. Sometimes the blood was that of a victim, and the two parties to the covenant prayed, that, if they broke it, his fate might be theirs (Hom. <span class="accented">1l.</span> 3:298; 19:252; Leviticus 1:24; 21:45; etc.). Sometimes it was the blood of the two parties themselves, who each drank of the other's blood, and thereby contracted a blood-relationship, which would have made their breaking the covenant more unpardonable (Herod. 1:74; 4:70; Tacit. <span class="accented">Ann</span>. 12:47). Moses seems to have followed neither practice at all closely, but, adopting simply the principle that a covenant required to be sealed with blood, to have arranged the details as he thought best. By the sprinkling of both the altar and the people the two parties to the covenant were made partakers of one and the same blood, and so brought into a sort of sacramental union. <p> CHAPTER 24:9-11 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/24-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the blood,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(had&#183;d&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1818.htm">Strong's 1818: </a> </span><span class="str2">Blood, of man, an animal, the juice of the grape, bloodshed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sprinkled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1430;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiz&#183;r&#333;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2236.htm">Strong's 2236: </a> </span><span class="str2">Be here and there, scatter, sprinkle, strew </span><br /><br /><span class="word">it on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
