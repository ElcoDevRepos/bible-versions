The specific formula for this incense was given by God to Moses, emphasizing its sanctity and unique purpose. The prohibition against making a similar incense for personal use underscores the holiness of items dedicated to God. This reflects the broader biblical principle of setting apart certain things for divine purposes, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a> with the unauthorized fire offered by Nadab and Abihu.<p><b>to enjoy its fragrance</b><br>The incense was not merely a pleasant aroma but a symbol of the prayers of the people ascending to God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>. The enjoyment of its fragrance for personal pleasure would profane its sacred purpose. This highlights the importance of reverence and the proper use of what is consecrated to God, a theme that runs throughout Scripture, including the misuse of holy things in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5:1-4</a>.<p><b>shall be cut off from his people.</b><br>Being "cut off" implies a severe consequence, often understood as excommunication or even death, depending on the context. This punishment reflects the seriousness of violating God's commands regarding holiness and purity. The phrase indicates a breach of covenant relationship, similar to the consequences outlined in <a href="/leviticus/20-3.htm">Leviticus 20:3-5</a> for idolatry. It underscores the gravity of maintaining the sanctity of worship and the community's responsibility to uphold God's standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the laws and instructions from God on Mount Sinai, including the instructions for the incense.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given specific laws and instructions to follow as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where God dwelled among His people and where the incense was to be used.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron, who were responsible for performing the rituals and offerings in the Tabernacle, including the burning of incense.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/incense.htm">Incense</a></b><br>A sacred mixture of spices used in the Tabernacle, symbolizing the prayers of the people ascending to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_instructions.htm">Reverence for God's Instructions</a></b><br>The specific instructions regarding the incense highlight the importance of reverence and obedience to God's commands.

The Lord had just said, &#8220;You are to regard this incense as most holy.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Something like it&#8221; underscores that even a close imitation violates God&#8217;s boundary. The same principle appears later when Uzzah touches the ark and is struck down (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6&#8211;7</a>); near-misses still count as disobedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to enjoy its fragrance</b><p>&#8226; The incense was consecrated for worship alone, symbolizing the prayers of God&#8217;s people rising before Him (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Using it merely for personal pleasure turns what is sacred into common perfume&#8212;robbing God of glory for self-gratification (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15-16</a>, where believers themselves become &#8220;the fragrance of Christ,&#8221; not a commodity).<p>&#8226; This clause exposes motive: enjoying the scent outside the sanctuary divorces the gift from the Giver, echoing Esau trading his birthright for a meal (<a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>shall be cut off from his people</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Cut off&#8221; denotes the severest covenant penalty&#8212;removal from community and, in many contexts, death (<a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>). God defends His holiness by separating the unholy.<p>&#8226; The warning magnifies grace: Israel may approach God, but only on His terms. <a href="/hebrews/10-29.htm">Hebrews 10:29</a> asks how much worse punishment awaits those who &#8220;trample the Son of God&#8221; by treating His blood as common.<p>&#8226; This penalty protected corporate worship; unchecked profanation spreads (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>, &#8220;a little leaven leavens the whole batch&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/30-38.htm">Exodus 30:38</a> stakes out a clear boundary: God&#8217;s sacred things are never for casual use. Replicating the holy incense for personal enjoyment treats divine worship as human entertainment and incurs the ultimate covenant sanction&#8212;being cut off. The verse calls every believer to honor what God sets apart, approach Him on His terms, and treasure holiness above personal taste.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/30-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Anyone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">makes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">something like</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1502;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3644.htm">Strong's 3644: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like, as, when</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it to enjoy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;r&#238;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Hifil - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7306.htm">Strong's 7306: </a> </span><span class="str2">Accept, smell, touch, make of quick understanding </span><br /><br /><span class="word">its fragrance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">shall be cut off</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1430;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ni&#7733;&#183;ra&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3772.htm">Strong's 3772: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut, to destroy, consume, to covenant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from his people.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1497;&#1493;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;am&#183;m&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/30-38.htm">Exodus 30:38 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/30-38.htm">Exodus 30:38 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/30-38.htm">Exodus 30:38 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/30-38.htm">Exodus 30:38 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/30-38.htm">Exodus 30:38 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/30-38.htm">Exodus 30:38  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/30-38.htm">Exodus 30:38 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/30-38.htm">Exodus 30:38 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/30-38.htm">Exodus 30:38 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/30-38.htm">Exodus 30:38 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/30-38.htm">OT Law: Exodus 30:38 Whoever shall make any like that (Exo.
