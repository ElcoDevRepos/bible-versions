Silver often symbolizes redemption in the Bible, as seen in the silver shekels used for the atonement money (<a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>). The forty bases suggest a foundation of redemption upon which the Tabernacle, a dwelling place for God's presence, is established. The number forty is frequently associated with periods of testing and preparation in Scripture, such as the forty years the Israelites spent in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>).<p><b>two bases under each frame.</b><br>The structure of the Tabernacle was designed with precision, reflecting God's order and holiness. Each frame having two bases indicates stability and support, ensuring the Tabernacle's durability. This duality can symbolize the balance of justice and mercy, foundational attributes of God's character. The frames and bases together create a unified structure, much like the unity of believers in the body of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>). The meticulous design points to the care and intentionality of God in His dwelling among His people, foreshadowing the incarnation of Christ, who is both fully God and fully man, the ultimate meeting place of God and humanity (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the Tabernacle from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary used by the Israelites as a place of worship during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were on their way to the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area where the Israelites wandered for 40 years, during which the Tabernacle was constructed and used.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_silver_bases.htm">The Silver Bases</a></b><br>Part of the Tabernacle's construction, these bases provided stability and support for the frames of the sanctuary.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The detailed instructions for the Tabernacle highlight the importance of obedience to God's commands.

The detail is literal, yet the Lord often weaves spiritual threads into the fabric of physical instructions.<p>&#8226; Forty in Scripture frequently marks completeness after testing&#8212;think of Noah&#8217;s forty days of rain (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>), Israel&#8217;s forty years in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>), and Jesus&#8217; forty days of fasting (<a href="/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1-2</a>). The full count of forty sockets announces that the entire side of the sanctuary rests on a foundation that is complete, lacking nothing.<p>&#8226; Each base was solid silver, one talent apiece (<a href="/exodus/38-27.htm">Exodus 38:27</a>), a weight of roughly seventy-five pounds. Silver is the metal of redemption: every Israelite male paid a half-shekel of silver as &#8220;atonement money&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12-16</a>), a price echoed when Judas betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>), and finally transcended when we were redeemed &#8220;not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; When the north wall stood on silver, Israel saw daily that God&#8217;s dwelling place rises on redemption&#8212;not on human merit, but on a price already paid (<a href="/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>two bases under each frame</b><p>&#8220;two under each of the twenty frames&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/26-21.htm">Exodus 26:21</a>) focuses our attention on the way every single plank was secured.<p>&#8226; Two sockets received the twin tenons (<a href="/exodus/26-17.htm">Exodus 26:17</a>), locking each acacia board upright. Two is the number of witness and confirmation (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>); the support system itself testified that God&#8217;s structure would not waver (<a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Picture the balance: one base alone would tip, three would wobble, but two hold steady. In Christ we find that same pairing&#8212;grace and truth (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), faith and works in harmony (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17-22</a>), love for God and love for neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>).<p>&#8226; No frame was left without its double anchor, reminding us that every believer is personally, securely grounded in the finished work of Jesus (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/26-21.htm">Exodus 26:21</a> gives a literal construction note and a lasting theological echo.
