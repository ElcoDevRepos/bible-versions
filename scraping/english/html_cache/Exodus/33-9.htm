It symbolizes a place of divine encounter and revelation. The tent's location outside the camp signifies the separation between the holiness of God and the sinfulness of the people. This setting prefigures the tabernacle and later the temple, where God's presence would dwell among His people. Moses, as a mediator, foreshadows Christ, who enters the heavenly sanctuary on behalf of humanity.<p><b>the pillar of cloud would come down</b><br>The pillar of cloud represents God's presence and guidance for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It is a visible manifestation of God's glory and protection, similar to the Shekinah glory that filled the tabernacle and later the temple. This cloud also served as a guide, leading the Israelites by day. The descent of the cloud signifies God's willingness to meet with Moses and communicate His will, emphasizing the importance of divine guidance in the life of believers.<p><b>and remain at the entrance</b><br>The cloud remaining at the entrance of the tent indicates God's readiness to engage with Moses and His people. It serves as a barrier, signifying that only those called by God, like Moses, could enter His presence. This concept of restricted access is echoed in the Holy of Holies within the tabernacle and temple, where only the high priest could enter once a year. It underscores the holiness of God and the need for a mediator, pointing to Jesus Christ as the ultimate mediator who grants believers access to God.<p><b>and the LORD would speak with Moses</b><br>This direct communication between God and Moses highlights the unique relationship Moses had with God, described elsewhere as speaking "face to face" (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>). It underscores Moses' role as a prophet and leader, chosen to deliver God's law and guidance to Israel. This interaction prefigures the intimate relationship believers can have with God through Christ, who is the Word made flesh. It also points to the prophetic office of Christ, who reveals God's will to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central human figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the mediator between God and His people.
