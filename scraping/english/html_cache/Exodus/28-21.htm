This connection emphasizes the unity and diversity of the nation of Israel. The stones were set in the high priest's breastplate, symbolizing that the priest carried the people before God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's covenant with Israel, as seen in <a href="/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>, where Jacob blesses his sons, and in <a href="/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12</a>, where the twelve tribes are inscribed on the gates of the New Jerusalem.<p><b>each engraved like a seal</b><br>The engraving of each stone like a seal signifies permanence and authority. Seals in ancient times were used to authenticate documents and denote ownership or identity. This imagery suggests that the tribes are permanently inscribed in God's plan and purpose. The use of seals is also seen in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>, where believers are sealed with the Holy Spirit, indicating security and belonging to God.<p><b>with the name of one of the twelve tribes</b><br>Each stone bearing the name of a tribe highlights the individual identity and role of each tribe within the nation. This personalization underscores the importance of each tribe's contribution to the whole. Historically, the tribes had distinct roles and territories, as detailed in the book of Joshua. The mention of the twelve tribes also points forward to the eschatological vision in <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>, where members from each tribe are sealed, indicating their inclusion in God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_israel.htm">The Sons of Israel</a></b><br>These are the twelve sons of Jacob, whose descendants became the twelve tribes of Israel.
