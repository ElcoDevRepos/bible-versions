The chapter outlines various scenarios and the corresponding penalties. Here, the law provides an alternative to the death penalty for a man whose ox has killed someone, assuming the owner was aware of the ox's dangerous behavior. Instead of capital punishment, a financial compensation can be demanded. This reflects the principle of restitution, which is a recurring theme in the Mosaic Law, emphasizing justice and restoration over retribution. It also highlights the value of human life and the possibility of redemption through compensation.<p><b>he may redeem his life</b><br>The concept of redemption is central to biblical theology, symbolizing deliverance from danger or sin. In this legal context, it refers to the ability to save one's life through a financial payment. This notion of redemption foreshadows the ultimate redemption offered through Jesus Christ, who paid the price for humanity's sins. The idea of redeeming one's life through a substitute payment is a precursor to the New Testament's teaching on Christ's sacrificial death as a ransom for many (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>by paying the full amount demanded of him</b><br>The requirement to pay the full amount underscores the importance of justice and accountability. It ensures that the penalty is sufficient to compensate for the loss or harm caused. This principle is consistent with the broader biblical theme of justice, where the punishment must fit the crime (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>). The full payment also serves as a deterrent, encouraging individuals to take responsibility for their actions and prevent future harm. This reflects God's character as just and fair, ensuring that wrongs are righted and relationships are restored.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Exodus, who received the Law from God on Mount Sinai.

Here the Lord introduces an alternative: the aggrieved family or the governing judges may &#8220;demand&#8221; a ransom rather than the owner&#8217;s death (compare <a href="/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31</a>, where no ransom is allowed for intentional murder).<p>&#8226; The phrase signals that life is precious, justice must be served, yet mercy may be shown. Authority to set the terms does not lie with the offender but with those who suffered loss and with the judges who stand in God&#8217;s place (<a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25-26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he may redeem his life</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Redeem&#8221; means to buy back what would otherwise be lost&#8212;here, literally rescuing his own life from the legal sentence of death.<p>&#8226; This echoes earlier ransom language for Israel&#8217;s census (<a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12-16</a>) and points ahead to the ultimate redemption purchased by Christ (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5-6</a>), underscoring the Bible-wide principle that a life can be spared through an accepted substitute.<p>&#8226; Key takeaways:<p>&#8211; Personal responsibility is non-negotiable (<a href="/galatians/6-5.htm">Galatians 6:5</a>).<p>&#8211; Mercy is possible, but it never dismisses guilt; it satisfies justice through an equivalent payment (<a href="/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by paying the full amount demanded of him</b><p>&#8226; No partial settlements&#8212;&#8220;full amount&#8221; stresses complete restitution (<a href="/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The payment has a dual purpose:<p>&#8211; Compensate the victim&#8217;s family for their irreplaceable loss (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a> sets the seriousness of taking life).<p>&#8211; Uphold public justice so that negligence is never trivialized (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-20.htm">Deuteronomy 19:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical implications:<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s law balances justice and compassion, deterring recklessness while leaving room for reconciliation.<p>&#8211; The offender&#8217;s wealth cannot bargain down the price; the standard is set outside of him, mirroring the way salvation requires the exact, sufficient price paid by Christ alone (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/21-30.htm">Exodus 21:30</a> shows that when a negligent act leads to death, God&#8217;s law permits a ransom to spare the offender&#8217;s life, provided the full, just price set by rightful authorities is paid.
