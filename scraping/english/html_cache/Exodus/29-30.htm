The priesthood was passed down from father to son, ensuring continuity in the religious leadership of the Israelites. This succession underscores the importance of family lineage in maintaining the sanctity and order of worship. The concept of a priestly lineage is echoed in the New Testament with Jesus as our High Priest, who is described as being in the order of Melchizedek, a priesthood that transcends the Levitical line (<a href="/hebrews/7-17.htm">Hebrews 7:17</a>).<p><b>and enters the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness. It was a sacred space where God communicated with Moses and where the priests performed their duties. The Tent of Meeting symbolizes God's desire to dwell among His people, a theme that culminates in the New Testament with the incarnation of Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>to minister in the Holy Place</b><br>The Holy Place was the first room within the Tabernacle, containing the table of showbread, the lampstand, and the altar of incense. Only priests were allowed to enter this area to perform their sacred duties, which included maintaining the lamps, offering incense, and replacing the showbread. This ministry foreshadows the work of Christ, who serves as our mediator and intercessor before God (<a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>).<p><b>must wear them for seven days</b><br>The garments referred to are the sacred vestments worn by the high priest, which included the ephod, breastplate, robe, tunic, turban, and sash. Wearing these garments for seven days signifies a period of consecration and dedication to the Lord's service. The number seven often represents completeness and perfection in the Bible, indicating the fullness of the priest's consecration. This period of consecration parallels the complete and perfect sacrifice of Jesus, who fulfilled all righteousness on behalf of humanity (<a href="/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, appointed by God.
