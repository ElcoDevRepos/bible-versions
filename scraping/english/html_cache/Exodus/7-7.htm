Moses spent the first forty years of his life in Egypt, learning the ways of the Egyptians, and the next forty years in Midian, where he was prepared by God for his mission. This reflects a life divided into three distinct phases, each forty years long, which is a recurring theme in Scripture. The number forty often represents a time of testing or trial, as seen in the forty days of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>) and Jesus' forty days in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>).<p><b>and Aaron was eighty-three</b><br>Aaron, being three years older than Moses, highlights the importance of family lineage and leadership roles in Israelite culture. As the elder brother, Aaron's role as Moses' spokesperson (<a href="/exodus/4-14.htm">Exodus 4:14-16</a>) is significant, especially considering the cultural respect for elder siblings. Aaron's age also indicates his experience and readiness to assist Moses in leading the Israelites out of Egypt. This partnership between Moses and Aaron is a precursor to the later establishment of the Levitical priesthood, with Aaron as the first high priest (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>).<p><b>when they spoke to Pharaoh</b><br>The act of speaking to Pharaoh is a pivotal moment in the Exodus narrative. Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, was considered a god by his people, making this confrontation not just a political challenge but a spiritual one. Moses and Aaron's boldness in approaching Pharaoh demonstrates their obedience to God's command and their faith in His power. This encounter sets the stage for the subsequent plagues and the eventual liberation of the Israelites. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance found in Jesus Christ, who confronts the powers of sin and death to free humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Book of Exodus, Moses is chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.

Scripture paints Moses as uniquely prepared for this moment&#8212;trained in Egypt&#8217;s courts (<a href="/acts/7-22.htm">Acts 7:22</a>) yet molded by forty quiet years in Midian (<a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>; <a href="/acts/7-30.htm">Acts 7:30</a>). <a href="/numbers/12-3.htm">Numbers 12:3</a> underscores his humility, while <a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a> declares that no prophet in Israel would match his face-to-face fellowship with God. All of that history funnels into the single word &#8220;Moses&#8221; here, grounding the narrative in a real man with a real mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was eighty years old</b><p>&#8226; The detail is literal: by the calendar Moses has reached eighty. <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a> (attributed to Moses) admits human strength usually tops out at &#8220;seventy years, or eighty if we are strong,&#8221; highlighting that he is ministering at the edge of normal human vigor.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a> notes Moses was forty when he first felt stirred to help Israel, and <a href="/acts/7-30.htm">Acts 7:30</a> marks another forty years before the burning bush&#8212;two full generations of preparation.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s timing insists that age never limits obedience; if anything, the decades sharpen faith and deepen dependence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Aaron</b><p>Aaron steps back into focus, the brother God appointed as spokesman when Moses hesitated (<a href="/exodus/4-14.htm">Exodus 4:14-16</a>). His lineage will anchor the priesthood (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>), yet here he is simply a fellow servant standing shoulder to shoulder with Moses. The text&#8217;s equal treatment of both brothers models partnership in ministry: different gifts, one assignment (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was eighty-three</b><p>Aaron, the elder by three years (<a href="/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a>), reminds us that God may elevate one sibling above another without diminishing either. His seniority never breeds rivalry; instead, Aaron willingly echoes Moses&#8217; words before Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/7-2.htm">Exodus 7:2</a>). Later failures (<a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1-6</a>) will not erase this moment of faithful cooperation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when they spoke to Pharaoh</b><p>The phrase places both men right where God told them to be (<a href="/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>; 7:1-2). Pharaoh embodies worldly power, yet two aging shepherds confront him armed only with the word of the LORD. <a href="/hebrews/11-27.htm">Hebrews 11:27</a> credits Moses&#8217; courage to seeing &#8220;Him who is invisible,&#8221; and that same courage steadied Aaron. Their conversation with Pharaoh launches the plagues, the Exodus, and eventually the giving of the Law&#8212;all rippling from a single act of spoken obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7</a> is far more than a footnote about birthdays. It asserts that God&#8217;s call can mature for decades, that age cannot cancel usefulness, and that teamwork under God&#8217;s direction overcomes earth&#8217;s greatest thrones. Two elderly brothers, firmly committed to God&#8217;s literal promises, step into history&#8217;s spotlight precisely when the LORD says &#8220;Go,&#8221; and the world has never been the same.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Moses was fourscore years old.</span>--Compare <a href="/deuteronomy/34-7.htm" title="And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>; <a href="/acts/7-23.htm" title="And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers the children of Israel.">Acts 7:23</a>; <a href="/acts/7-30.htm" title="And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.">Acts 7:30</a>.

It is also accepted as exact by St. Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23, 30</a>). Moderns are surprised that at such an age a man could undertake and carry through a difficult and dangerous enterprise; but in Egypt one hundred and ten years was not considered a very exceptionally long life, and men frequently retained their full vigour till seventy or eighty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/7-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was eighty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#333;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8084.htm">Strong's 8084: </a> </span><span class="str2">Eighty, eightieth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years old</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Aaron</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1469;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_175.htm">Strong's 175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aaron -- an elder brother of Moses</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was eighty-three</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7969.htm">Strong's 7969: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three, third, thrice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when they spoke</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#601;&#183;r&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Verb - Piel - Infinitive construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Pharaoh.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/7-7.htm">OT Law: Exodus 7:7 Moses was eighty years old and Aaron (Exo.
