In the context of the battle against the Amalekites, Moses' raised hands symbolize intercession and dependence on God for victory. The heaviness of his hands can be seen as a metaphor for the burdens of leadership and the need for support from others. This moment underscores the importance of community and shared responsibility in fulfilling God's purposes.<p><b>they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it</b><br>The stone provided a practical solution to Moses' fatigue, allowing him to continue his role in the battle. Stones often symbolize strength and stability in the Bible, and here it serves as a foundation for Moses' endurance. This act of providing a stone reflects the supportive role of the community in leadership, as seen in other biblical narratives where leaders are supported by their followers.<p><b>Then Aaron and Hur held his hands up, one on each side</b><br>Aaron and Hur's actions demonstrate the importance of teamwork and mutual support in spiritual battles. Aaron, Moses' brother, and Hur, a leader from the tribe of Judah, represent the collaborative effort needed to achieve God's purposes. This scene foreshadows the New Testament principle of bearing one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>) and highlights the role of leaders in supporting each other.<p><b>so that his hands remained steady until the sun went down</b><br>The steadiness of Moses' hands until sunset signifies perseverance and the sustained effort required in spiritual warfare. The mention of the sun going down marks the completion of a day's battle, symbolizing the endurance needed to see God's promises fulfilled. This perseverance is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to run the race with endurance (<a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>). The victory over the Amalekites, achieved through divine intervention and human cooperation, prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

His hands, long stretched to heaven, grew weary, "heavy," feeble; he could no longer raise them up, much less stretch them out, by his own muscular energy. They sank down, and dropped by his sides. If the battle was not to be lost, it was necessary to find some remedy. Apparently, Aaron and Hur bethought themselves of an effective remedy, none being suggested by Moses.<p><span class= "bld">They took a stone.</span>--Partly to give him a certain amount of rest, but, perhaps, mainly to enable them the better to sustain his hands.

Moses, no doubt, held the rod alternately with one hand and the other, until both were so tired that he could hold them up no longer. It is this natural weariness which is expressed by the words - "his hands were heavy." When Aaron and Hut perceived this, they brought a stone for him to sit on, and then, standing one on either side of him, alternately <span class="cmt_word">supported his hands</span> until the sun set and the battle was over.
