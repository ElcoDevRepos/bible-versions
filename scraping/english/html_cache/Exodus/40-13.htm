These garments were specifically designed by divine instruction (Exodus 28) and symbolized purity, holiness, and the glory of God. The garments included the ephod, breastplate, robe, tunic, turban, and sash, each with its own symbolic meaning. The act of clothing Aaron represents the covering of sin and the righteousness required to approach God, prefiguring the righteousness of Christ that covers believers (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<p><b>anoint him</b><br>Anointing with oil was a common practice in the ancient Near East for consecrating individuals to a sacred office. The oil, often a mixture of olive oil and spices, symbolized the Holy Spirit's presence and empowerment. In Aaron's case, it marked his divine appointment and the beginning of his priestly duties. This anointing foreshadows the anointing of Jesus as the Messiah (meaning "Anointed One") and the anointing of believers with the Holy Spirit (1 <a href="/john/2-20.htm">John 2:20, 27</a>).<p><b>and consecrate him</b><br>Consecration involves setting someone or something apart for a sacred purpose. For Aaron, this meant being dedicated entirely to the service of God. The process included sacrifices and rituals that underscored the seriousness of approaching a holy God. This consecration points to the ultimate consecration of Jesus, who was set apart to fulfill the role of the perfect High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-28</a>).<p><b>so that he may serve Me as a priest</b><br>The role of the priest was to mediate between God and the people, offering sacrifices and prayers on their behalf. Aaron's service as a priest was foundational for the Levitical priesthood, which continued until the time of Christ. This priestly service is a type of Christ's eternal priesthood, as He serves as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).
