Leaven, or yeast, symbolizes sin and corruption in biblical typology, and the removal of leaven from their homes represents purification and separation from sin. The seven-day period signifies completeness and perfection, reflecting God's complete deliverance of His people. This practice is part of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which immediately follows Passover, commemorating the haste with which the Israelites left Egypt, as they did not have time to let their bread rise. This observance is a perpetual reminder of God's faithfulness and deliverance.<p><b>and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD</b><br>The seventh day culminates in a feast to the LORD, highlighting the importance of worship and thanksgiving in the life of the Israelites. This feast is not merely a communal meal but a sacred assembly dedicated to God, emphasizing His central role in their deliverance. The number seven often represents divine perfection and completion in Scripture, and the feast on the seventh day signifies the completion of God's redemptive act. This celebration foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of the Passover Lamb, offering eternal salvation and rest. The feast serves as a type of the future Messianic banquet, where believers will celebrate the ultimate victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who conveyed God's commandments, including the observance of the Feast of Unleavened Bread.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and instructed to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread as a perpetual reminder of their deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which the Israelites were delivered, symbolizing sin and oppression.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_unleavened_bread.htm">Feast of Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>A seven-day observance following Passover, commemorating the haste of the Israelites' departure from Egypt and their reliance on God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who delivered Israel and commanded the observance of this feast as a sign of His faithfulness and their consecration to Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_unleavened_bread.htm">Symbolism of Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>Unleavened bread symbolizes purity and separation from sin.
