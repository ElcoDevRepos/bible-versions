The LORD, or Yahweh, is the covenant name of God, highlighting His personal relationship with Israel. This communication underscores God's active role in the deliverance of His people, a theme consistent throughout the Exodus narrative.<p><b>to Moses and Aaron</b><br>Moses and Aaron are central figures in the Exodus story. Moses, chosen by God as the leader of the Israelites, and Aaron, his brother and spokesperson, are instrumental in the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. Their partnership is significant, as it demonstrates God's provision of leadership and support. This also prefigures the New Testament concept of apostleship, where leaders are sent with divine authority.<p><b>in the land of Egypt</b><br>The setting in Egypt is crucial, as it represents the place of Israel's bondage and suffering. Egypt, a powerful and advanced civilization, is often symbolic of worldly power and oppression in biblical literature. The historical context of the Israelites' enslavement sets the stage for God's redemptive acts. This location also foreshadows the greater deliverance from sin and death through Jesus Christ, as Egypt is a type of the world from which believers are delivered.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is about to deliver His people from slavery in Egypt.

After nine crushing plagues (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;11</a>), the narrative pivots to the climactic Passover instructions.<p>&#8226; Scripture often marks turning points with similar words&#8212;&#8220;Now the word of the LORD came&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>), &#8220;Now after John was arrested&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14</a>).

We can trust the Bible&#8217;s chronology because &#8220;the word of the LORD is flawless&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The Berean Standard Bible renders the covenant name YHWH as &#8220;the LORD.&#8221; This is the same &#8220;I AM WHO I AM&#8221; who spoke from the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>).<p>&#8226; His unchanging character undergirds the entire Passover story (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).
