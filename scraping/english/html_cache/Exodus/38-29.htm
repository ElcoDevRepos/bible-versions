The wave offering, a type of peace offering, involved the presentation of materials to God, symbolizing dedication and consecration. Bronze, a durable metal, represents judgment and endurance, as seen in the bronze serpent (<a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>) and the bronze altar (<a href="/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>). The use of bronze in the Tabernacle signifies the need for purification and atonement before approaching God.<p><b>totaled 70 talents</b><br>A talent was a unit of weight used in ancient times, approximately 75 pounds or 34 kilograms. Seventy talents of bronze would be a substantial amount, indicating the generosity and commitment of the Israelites in contributing to the Tabernacle's construction. The number 70 often symbolizes completeness or a large, significant quantity in Scripture, as seen in the 70 elders of Israel (<a href="/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>) and the 70 nations listed in <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>.<p><b>and 2,400 shekels</b><br>A shekel was a smaller unit of weight, roughly equivalent to 0.4 ounces or 11 grams. The specific mention of 2,400 shekels highlights the precision and care in accounting for the materials used in the Tabernacle. This meticulous record-keeping reflects the importance of stewardship and integrity in handling resources dedicated to God's service. The detailed accounting also underscores the transparency and accountability in the community's offerings, ensuring that all contributions were used appropriately for the sacred purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who contributed materials for the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where God dwelled among His people during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wave_offering.htm">Wave Offering</a></b><br>A type of offering presented before the Lord, symbolizing the dedication of the materials for sacred use.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_generosity.htm">The Importance of Generosity</a></b><br>The Israelites' contributions of bronze and other materials highlight the importance of giving willingly and generously to the work of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_use_of_resources.htm">God's Provision and Use of Resources</a></b><br>God provided the necessary resources for the Tabernacle through the people, demonstrating that He equips His people to fulfill His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_wave_offering.htm">Symbolism of the Wave Offering</a></b><br>The wave offering signifies dedication and consecration, reminding believers to dedicate their resources and talents to God's service.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_involvement_in_god's_work.htm">Community Involvement in God's Work</a></b><br>The construction of the Tabernacle was a communal effort, illustrating the importance of unity and collaboration in the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_stewardship.htm">Faithfulness in Stewardship</a></b><br>The careful accounting of the materials used for the Tabernacle serves as a model for faithful stewardship of God's resources.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_38_29_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 38:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_38_29_Generosity_s_role.htm">How does Exodus 38:29 illustrate the importance of generosity in God's work?
