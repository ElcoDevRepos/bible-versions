The timing also emphasizes the immediacy of Jethro's observations and advice.<p><b>Moses took his seat to judge the people</b><br>Moses' role as a judge was crucial in maintaining order and justice among the Israelites. This reflects the theocratic leadership structure where Moses acted as both a spiritual and civil leader. The act of sitting to judge signifies authority and the formal nature of his role. This prefigures Christ as the ultimate judge, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>, where all judgment is entrusted to the Son.<p><b>and they stood around him</b><br>The people standing around Moses indicates their dependence on his wisdom and leadership. It also reflects the communal nature of Israelite society, where disputes were settled publicly. This can be compared to the New Testament church, where believers are encouraged to seek wise counsel and resolve conflicts within the community (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>).<p><b>from morning until evening</b><br>This phrase highlights the overwhelming burden on Moses, as he was the sole judge for a large population. It underscores the need for delegation and shared leadership, which Jethro later advises. This situation foreshadows the establishment of a more structured judicial system in Israel, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9-18</a>, and points to the need for leaders to rely on others, a principle echoed in the New Testament with the appointment of deacons in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egyptian bondage.

Rulers in these ages were sometimes even called "judges," as were those of Israel from Joshua to Samuel, and those of Carthage at a later date (<span class= "ital">suffetes</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Ability to judge was thought to mark out a person as qualified for the kingly office (Herod. i. 97). Moses, it would seem, had, from the time that he became chief of his nation, undertaken the hearing of all complaints and the decision of all causes. He held court days from time to time, when the host was stationary, and judged all the cases that were brought before him. No causes were decided by any one else. Either it had not occurred to him that the duty might be discharged by deputy, or he had seen reasons against the adoption of such an arrangement. Perhaps he had thought his countrymen unfit as yet for the difficult task. At any rate, he had acted as sole judge, and had, no doubt, to discharge the duty pretty frequently. Knowing that there was much business on hand, he did not allow the visit of his near connection to interfere with his usual habits, but held his court just as if Jethro had not been there.<p><span class= "bld">The people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.</span>--So great was the number of causes, or so difficult were they of decision, that Moses was occupied the whole day in deciding them. Following the usual Oriental practice, he began early in the morning, and found himself compelled to continue until nightfall. It is not clear whether his "sessions" were always of this length, or whether on this occasion the ordinary time was exceeded. Some have suggested that the division of the Amalekite spoil would naturally have led to disputes, and so to complaints.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-26.</span> - JETHRO'S ADVICE TO MOSES, AND ITS ADOPTION. The office of ruler in ancient times, whether exercised by a king, a prince, or a mere chieftain, was always understood to include within it the office of judge. In the Greek ideal of the origin of kingly government (Herod. 1:96), the able discharge of judicial functions marks the individual out for sovereignty. The successors of Moses, like the chief rulers of Carthage, bore the title of "Judges" (<span class="accented">shophetim, suffetes</span>). Moses, it appears, had from the time when he was accepted as leader by the people (<a href="/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29-31</a>), regarded himself as bound to hear and decide all the causes and complaints which arose among the entire Israelite people. He had net delegated his authority to any one. This can scarcely have been because the idea had not occurred to him, for the Egyptian kings ordinarily decided causes by judges nominated <span class="accented">ad hoc</span>. Perhaps he had distrusted the ability of his countrymen - so recently slaves - to discharge such delicate functions. At any rate, he had reserved the duty wholly to himself (ver. 18). This course appeared to Jethro unwise. No man could, he thought, in the case of so great a nation, singly discharge such an office with satisfaction to himself and others. Moses would "wear himself away" with the fatigue; and he would exhaust the patience of the people through inability to keep pace with the number of cases that necessarily arose. Jethro therefore recommended the appointment of subordinate judges, and the reservation by Moses of nothing but the right to decide such cases as these judges should, on account of their difficulty, refer to him (ver. 22) On reflection, Moses accepted this course as the best open to him under the circumstances, and established a multiplicity of judges, under a system which will be discussed in the comment on verse 25. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the morrow</span>. The day after Jethro's arrival. <span class="cmt_word">Moses sat to judge the people</span>.
