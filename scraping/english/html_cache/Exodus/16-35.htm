This period of forty years represents a time of testing and reliance on God's provision. The number forty is significant in the Bible, often associated with periods of trial and preparation, such as the forty days of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). Manna symbolizes God's faithfulness and the necessity of spiritual sustenance, foreshadowing Jesus as the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>).<p><b>until they came to a land where they could settle</b><br>This phrase indicates the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to settling in the Promised Land. The land where they could settle refers to Canaan, a land promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This transition marks the fulfillment of God's promise and the end of their dependence on manna, as they would now rely on the produce of the land. It signifies a new chapter in Israel's history, moving from divine provision in the wilderness to a life of abundance in the land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>).<p><b>they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan</b><br>The cessation of manna at the border of Canaan underscores the completion of God's promise to bring the Israelites to the Promised Land. This event is recorded in <a href="/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>, where the manna stopped the day after they ate the produce of the land. The border of Canaan represents the threshold of a new beginning, where the Israelites would transition from a miraculous provision to a natural one, relying on the land's resources. This shift also highlights the importance of faith and obedience as they prepared to conquer and inhabit the land God had given them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/manna.htm">Manna</a></b><br>A miraculous food provided by God to sustain the Israelites during their 40-year journey in the wilderness.

Every morning&#8212;except the Sabbath&#8212;the flaky, sweet bread lay on the ground (<a href="/exodus/16-14.htm">Exodus 16:14-21</a>).<p>- The period also corresponds to a generation, underlining how completely the Lord sustained His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-3</a>).<p>- Nothing about manna was symbolic only; it was literal food that kept roughly two million people alive. Its taste and appearance are detailed (<a href="/exodus/16-31.htm">Exodus 16:31</a>; <a href="/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7-9</a>), inviting us to trust the straightforward biblical record.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until they came to a land where they could settle</b><p>&#8220;until they came to a land where they could settle&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>b).<p>- God never designed the wilderness as a permanent home; the goal was the land sworn to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; 26:3; 28:13).<p>- &#8220;A land flowing with milk and honey&#8221; promised rest, security, and harvests they did not plant (<a href="/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-11</a>).<p>- Manna served as a visible guarantee: if the Lord could feed them in a barren desert, He could certainly establish them in a fruitful land (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-21.htm">Deuteronomy 1:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-24.htm">Psalm 78:24-25</a>).<p>- The detail that manna lasted &#8220;until&#8221; they could settle shows God times His gifts perfectly.

That first bite of local food signaled a new chapter of normal provision.<p>- God&#8217;s faithfulness did not stop; it simply changed form&#8212;from daily miracles to seasonal harvests. His care is steady, though the methods vary (<a href="/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-33</a>).<p>- The border language hints at inheritance.

Manna&#8217;s cessation celebrated promise fulfilled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a> records a literal, forty-year miracle that ended exactly when Israel stepped onto Canaan&#8217;s soil.

He does not say that it had ceased to be given. We know that in fact it did not cease till the Jordan was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua, and Canaan was actually reached (<a href="/context/joshua/5-10.htm" title="And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.">Joshua 5:10-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of Israel did eat manna forty years</span>. Kalisch observes that the actual time was not forty full years, but about one month short of that period, since the manna began after the fifteenth day of the second month of the first year (verse 1) and terminated just after Passover of the forty-first year (<a href="/joshua/5-10.htm">Joshua 5:10-12</a>). It may be added that Mesas cannot have written the present passage later than about the eleventh month of the fortieth year (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-3.htm">Deuteronomy 1:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>; <a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>); when the manna had continued thirty-nine years and nine months. <span class="cmt_word">Until they came to a land inhabited</span>. Kalisch translates "the land of their habitation," or "which they were to inhabit," remarking that they had reached inhabited countries, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, those of Sihon and Og, much earlier. But the words will not bear this rendering. What the writer intends to note is, that the manna continued all the time they were in the wilderness, until they reached inhabited territory, and then further (in the next clause), that it lasted after that, until they came to the borders of Canaan. He does not say that it even then left off. He writes exactly as Moses might be expected to have written towards the close of his life. A later writer would, as Canon Cook observes, have been more specific. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/16-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
