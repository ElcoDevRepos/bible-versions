In the context of the Exodus narrative, this highlights the direct involvement of God in establishing His covenant with Israel. The tablets, containing the Ten Commandments, symbolize God's law and His authority. This divine authorship sets the tablets apart from other ancient legal codes, such as the Code of Hammurabi, which were humanly devised. The notion of God directly crafting the tablets also prefigures the New Covenant, where God's law is written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p><b>and the writing was the writing of God</b><br>This phrase further emphasizes the divine nature of the commandments. The writing being God's own signifies the perfection and holiness of the law. It reflects the idea that God's word is eternal and unchanging, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>, "Your word, LORD, is eternal; it stands firm in the heavens." The divine writing also points to the authority and authenticity of the commandments, which were meant to guide the moral and spiritual life of the Israelites. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), embodying the perfect revelation of God.<p><b>engraved on the tablets</b><br>The engraving signifies permanence and durability, indicating that God's law is meant to be lasting and unalterable. In ancient times, engraving on stone was a common method for preserving important texts, suggesting the enduring significance of the commandments. This permanence is echoed in the New Testament, where Paul speaks of believers as "letters from Christ...written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts" (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>). The engraving also connects to the idea of God's law being internalized by His people, a theme that runs throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to receive the Law on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where Moses received the Ten Commandments from God, a place of divine revelation and covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tablets.htm">The Tablets</a></b><br>Stone tablets inscribed by God Himself, containing the Ten Commandments, representing God's covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine author of the Law, who directly inscribed His commandments on the tablets, signifying His authority and holiness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were waiting at the base of Mount Sinai while Moses received the Law.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority.htm">Divine Authority</a></b><br>The fact that the tablets were the work of God underscores the divine authority and perfection of His Law.
