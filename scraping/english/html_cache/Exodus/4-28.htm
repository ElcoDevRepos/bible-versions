This phrase highlights the importance of communication and obedience in God's plan. Moses is acting as a prophet, a role that involves receiving and delivering God's messages. Aaron, his brother, is chosen by God to be Moses' spokesperson (<a href="/exodus/4-14.htm">Exodus 4:14-16</a>), which underscores the theme of partnership in ministry. This moment foreshadows the prophetic tradition in Israel, where prophets are God's mouthpieces (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). The relationship between Moses and Aaron also prefigures the New Testament concept of the body of Christ, where different members have different roles (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>and all the signs He had commanded him to perform</b><br>The signs refer to the miraculous acts God empowered Moses to perform to validate his divine commission (<a href="/exodus/4.htm">Exodus 4:1-9</a>). These include turning a staff into a serpent, making a hand leprous and then healing it, and turning water from the Nile into blood. These signs serve as evidence of God's power and authority, intended to convince both the Israelites and Pharaoh of Moses' legitimacy as God's messenger. The use of signs is a recurring biblical theme, seen in the ministries of Elijah and Elisha (<a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>, <a href="/2_kings/2-14.htm">2 Kings 2:14</a>) and ultimately in the miracles of Jesus Christ, which authenticate His divine nature and mission (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>). The signs also symbolize God's control over creation, a theme that runs throughout the Exodus narrative, culminating in the plagues and the parting of the Red Sea.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew prophet chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.
