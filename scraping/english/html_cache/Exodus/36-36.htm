This duality points to the incarnation of Jesus, who is fully God and fully man.<p><b>along with gold hooks</b><br>The gold hooks were functional, used to hang the curtains of the tabernacle.

The silver sockets foreshadow the redemptive footing on which the greater, final veil-opener&#8212;Jesus&#8212;would stand (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/36-36.htm">Exodus 36:36</a> shows that the veil&#8217;s posts, overlay, hooks, and bases were all crafted exactly as God commanded.
