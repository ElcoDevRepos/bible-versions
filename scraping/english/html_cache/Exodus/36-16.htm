The number five often symbolizes grace in biblical numerology, suggesting that the Tabernacle, as a dwelling place for God, is a manifestation of His grace among His people. The act of joining these curtains reflects the meticulous care and divine order in the construction of the Tabernacle, emphasizing the importance of following God's specific instructions. This unity can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the unity of believers in Christ, as the Church is often described as the body of Christ, joined together in faith and purpose.<p><b>and the other six into another</b><br>The number six is often associated with humanity and imperfection, as man was created on the sixth day. The separation of the curtains into two sets, one of five and one of six, may symbolize the distinction between divine grace and human imperfection. This division could also represent the separation between the holy and the common, a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God's holiness is set apart from the sinfulness of humanity. The careful construction and division of the Tabernacle's elements highlight the need for order and reverence in worship, pointing to the ultimate reconciliation and perfection found in Jesus Christ, who bridges the gap between God and man.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_curtains.htm">The Curtains</a></b><br>Part of the Tabernacle's structure, made of fine linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, symbolizing the beauty and holiness of God's dwelling.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who contributed materials and labor for the construction of the Tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>The joining of the curtains into sets symbolizes the unity of God's people, each with unique roles and contributions, working together for a common purpose.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>The meticulous following of God's design for the Tabernacle highlights the importance of obedience in our walk with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_among_his_people.htm">God's Presence Among His People</a></b><br>The Tabernacle represents God's desire to dwell among His people, reminding us of His continual presence in our lives today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_worship.htm">Preparation for Worship</a></b><br>Just as the Tabernacle was prepared for worship, we are called to prepare our hearts and lives as living temples for God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_36_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 36:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_36_16_God_s_provision_proof.htm">How does Exodus 36:16 demonstrate God's provision for the Israelites' needs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Teamwork_lessons_from_Exodus_36_16.htm">What can we learn about teamwork from the construction process in Exodus 36:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_36_16_s_link_to_obedience_theme.htm">How does Exodus 36:16 connect to the broader theme of obedience in Exodus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Exodus_36_16_today.htm">In what ways can we apply the principles of craftsmanship from Exodus 36:16 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Tabernacle_s_design_God_s_order.htm">How does the tabernacle's construction in Exodus 36:16 reflect God's order and design?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_36_16_Community_s_role_in_God_s_work.htm">How does Exodus 36:16 reflect the importance of community in achieving God's work?
