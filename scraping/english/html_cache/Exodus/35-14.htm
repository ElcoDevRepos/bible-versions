It was crafted from pure gold, as described in <a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-40</a>, and was placed in the Holy Place. The light from the lampstand represented the illumination of God's truth and wisdom, guiding the Israelites in their spiritual journey. The menorah's design, with its seven branches, is often seen as a symbol of perfection and completeness, reflecting God's perfect nature.<p><b>with its accessories</b><br>The accessories of the lampstand included tongs and trays, which were also made of pure gold. These tools were used for maintaining the lampstand, ensuring that the light remained constant. The meticulous care required for these accessories highlights the importance of maintaining spiritual vigilance and purity in worship. This attention to detail underscores the reverence and dedication expected in the service of God.<p><b>and lamps</b><br>The lamps on the menorah were filled with oil and provided light within the Tabernacle. Each lamp was carefully tended to ensure it burned continuously, symbolizing the perpetual presence of God among His people. The continuous light can be seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ, who declared Himself the "light of the world" in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, offering spiritual illumination and guidance to all who follow Him.<p><b>and oil for the light</b><br>The oil used in the lamps was pure olive oil, a symbol of the Holy Spirit in biblical typology. The oil's role in keeping the lamps burning signifies the sustaining power of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers. Just as the oil enabled the lampstand to provide light, the Holy Spirit empowers and enlightens Christians to live according to God's will. The use of olive oil also connects to the anointing practices in the Old Testament, where oil was used to consecrate priests and kings, pointing to the anointing of Jesus as the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is conveying God's instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are called to contribute materials and skills for the building of the Tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where God would dwell among His people during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lampstand.htm">Lampstand (Menorah)</a></b><br>A key piece of furniture in the Tabernacle, symbolizing God's light and presence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_light.htm">Symbolism of Light</a></b><br>The lampstand represents God's presence and guidance.

The people are now gathering materials for what God has revealed.<p>- Literally, this is the seven-branched menorah, hammered from a single talent of pure gold&#8212;no symbolic shortcut, no cheaper alloy (cf. <a href="/exodus/37-17.htm">Exodus 37:17</a>). The precision underscores that God decides how He will be worshiped.<p>- Spiritually, the menorah foreshadows the true Light. In <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, Jesus says, &#8220;I am the Light of the world.&#8221; <a href="/revelation/1-12.htm">Revelation 1:12-13</a> pictures Him standing among seven lampstands, affirming that what began in the tabernacle finds its fullness in Christ.<p>- The church also carries this lampstand imagery: <a href="/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a> warns that unfaithfulness can cause a lampstand to be removed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for light</b><p>- The lampstand&#8217;s purpose is practical: it &#8220;for light.&#8221; God requires light in His dwelling because He is light (<a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>).<p>- Darkness never belongs in the holy place. In <a href="/psalms/18-28.htm">Psalm 18:28</a> David testifies, &#8220;You, O LORD, light my lamp; my God illumines my darkness.&#8221;<p>- Jesus echoes this calling to believers in <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>, urging us not to hide our light but to let it shine so that others glorify the Father. The tabernacle&#8217;s constant glow models continuous witness.<p>- Obedience here is simple: God says, &#8220;Provide light,&#8221; and the people supply what He asks. We learn that worship involves both receiving revelation and responding in practical service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with its accessories and lamps</b><p>- &#8220;Accessories&#8221; include tongs, trays, snuffers, and wick trimmers (see <a href="/exodus/25-38.htm">Exodus 25:38</a>). These tools prevent soot and maintain steady flames.<p>- Nothing in God&#8217;s house is haphazard. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a> reminds believers, &#8220;Let all things be done decently and in order.&#8221;<p>- By listing every small item, Scripture shows that details matter. <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a> teaches that faithfulness in little things precedes greater trust from God.<p>- The separate &#8220;lamps&#8221; (individual cups atop each branch) distribute light widely; in <a href="/numbers/8-2.htm">Numbers 8:2</a> Aaron is told to set them &#8220;so that they illuminate the area in front.&#8221; Likewise, each believer contributes unique but cooperative witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and oil for the light</b><p>- The lamps are useless without pure olive oil. <a href="/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20</a> commands oil &#8220;clear, pressed,&#8221; symbolizing the Holy Spirit&#8217;s flawless supply (cf. <a href="/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1-6</a> where oil runs continually, declaring, &#8220;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit&#8221;).<p>- <a href="/leviticus/24-1.htm">Leviticus 24:1-4</a> requires the lamps to burn continually &#8220;from evening till morning,&#8221; portraying unceasing dependence on the Spirit, not sporadic bursts of self-effort.<p>- In <a href="/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a> the wise virgins bring extra oil, illustrating readiness for the Bridegroom. The lesson traces back to this tabernacle mandate: keep the oil stocked.<p>- Practically, the people&#8217;s contributions of oil show that fellowship with God always costs something&#8212;time, resources, devotion&#8212;but the resulting light blesses the whole camp.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/35-14.htm">Exodus 35:14</a> highlights a real golden lampstand, its tools, its lamps, and the pure oil required to keep it burning. God insists on specific obedience, continual light, careful maintenance, and Spirit-supplied fuel. The menorah points to Christ, the church, and every believer called to shine faithfully in a dark world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - For <span class="cmt_word">the candlestick</span>, its <span class="cmt_word">furniture</span>, and its <span class="cmt_word">lamps</span>, compare <a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-39</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/35-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the lampstand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1465;&#1512;&#1463;&#1447;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;n&#333;&#183;ra&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4501.htm">Strong's 4501: </a> </span><span class="str2">A chandelier</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for light</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3974.htm">Strong's 3974: </a> </span><span class="str2">A luminous body, luminary, light, brightness, cheerfulness, a chandelier</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with its accessories</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;&#1462;&#1430;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#234;&#183;le&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3627.htm">Strong's 3627: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something prepared, any apparatus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and lamps</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1461;&#1512;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1425;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#234;&#183;r&#333;&#183;&#7791;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5216.htm">Strong's 5216: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lamp, light</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and oil</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1502;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;e&#183;men)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8081.htm">Strong's 8081: </a> </span><span class="str2">Grease, liquid, richness</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for the light;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3974.htm">Strong's 3974: </a> </span><span class="str2">A luminous body, luminary, light, brightness, cheerfulness, a chandelier</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/35-14.htm">Exodus 35:14 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/35-14.htm">Exodus 35:14 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/35-14.htm">Exodus 35:14 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/35-14.htm">Exodus 35:14 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/35-14.htm">Exodus 35:14 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/35-14.htm">Exodus 35:14  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/35-14.htm">Exodus 35:14 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/35-14.htm">Exodus 35:14 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/35-14.htm">Exodus 35:14 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/35-14.htm">Exodus 35:14 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/35-14.htm">OT Law: Exodus 35:14 The lampstand also for the light (Exo.
