The Passover lamb was to be eaten entirely, with nothing left until morning, symbolizing the completeness of God's deliverance. This requirement ensured that the sacrifice was not wasted and that the community was involved in the observance. The lamb represents Christ, the Lamb of God, whose sacrifice is sufficient for all, yet must be personally appropriated.<p><b>they are to share with the nearest neighbor</b><br>This directive emphasizes community and fellowship, reflecting the communal nature of Israelite society. Sharing the lamb with a neighbor not only ensured that the commandment was fulfilled but also fostered unity and mutual support. This principle of sharing and community is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to bear one another's burdens and share in the Lord's Supper.<p><b>based on the number of people,</b><br>The number of people determined the sharing of the lamb, ensuring that everyone had enough to eat. This practical approach highlights God's concern for order and provision. It also prefigures the inclusivity of the Gospel, where salvation through Christ is available to all, regardless of number or status.<p><b>and apportion the lamb accordingly.</b><br>The careful apportioning of the lamb underscores the importance of stewardship and responsibility in God's commands. Each person was to receive a portion, symbolizing the personal nature of salvation. This mirrors the New Testament teaching that each believer must personally partake in the sacrifice of Christ, the true Passover Lamb, for redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

None are overlooked, none receive less than needed, and none are burdened with more than they can consume (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-12.htm">2 Corinthians 8:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Salvation&#8217;s provision is measured yet abundant&#8212;sufficient for all who will partake (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35-37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and apportion the lamb accordingly</b><p>Finally, households must &#8220;apportion the lamb accordingly.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The lamb is central: &#8220;Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>).

God commands that households too small for an entire lamb join with neighbors so every individual is fed precisely and none of the sacrifice is wasted. This practical guideline reveals His heart: He provides exactly what His people need, invites them to care for one another, ensures orderly participation, and foreshadows the perfect Lamb, Jesus Christ, whose one sacrifice is more than sufficient for all who come to the table.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">If the household be too little for the lamb.</span>--There would be cases where the family would not be large enough to consume an entire lamb at a sitting. Where this was so, men were to club with their neighbours, either two small families joining together, or a large family drafting off some of its members to bring up the numbers of a small one. According to Josephus (<span class= "ital">Bell.

Usage in course of time fixed the minimum number at ten. (Joseph. <span class="accented">Bell</span>. <span class="accented">Jud.</span> 6:9, &sect; 3.) The whole family, men, women and children participated. The lamb was generally slain between the ninth hour (3 p.m.) and the eleventh (5 p.m.). <span class="cmt_word">Let him and his neighbour take it according to the number of the souls</span>. If there were a household of only five, which could not possibly consume the lamb, any large neighbouring family was to send five or six of its number, to make up the deficiency. <span class="cmt_word">Every man according to his eating</span>, etc. It is difficult to see what sense our translators intended. The real direction is that, in providing a proper number of guests, consideration should be had of the amount which they would be likely to eat. Children and the very aged were not to be reckoned as if they were men in the vigour of life.
