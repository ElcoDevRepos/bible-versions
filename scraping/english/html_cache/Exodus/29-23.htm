Bread is a staple in the ancient Near Eastern diet, symbolizing life and nourishment. Biblically, bread often signifies God's provision, as seen in the manna provided in the wilderness (Exodus 16). This offering of bread is part of the ordination process, signifying the priests' dependence on God for their spiritual and physical needs.<p><b>one cake of bread made with oil</b><br>The cake made with oil signifies anointing and the presence of the Holy Spirit. Oil is frequently used in the Bible for anointing, symbolizing the setting apart of individuals for God's service (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). The inclusion of oil in the bread highlights the sanctification and empowerment of the priests for their holy duties. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the Anointed One, filled with the Holy Spirit (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<p><b>and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread</b><br>Unleavened bread is significant in the biblical narrative, particularly in the context of the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>). It symbolizes purity and the absence of sin, as leaven is often associated with corruption and sin (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>). The use of unleavened bread in the consecration ceremony underscores the need for holiness and purity in those who serve before the Lord. This points to Jesus Christ, who is sinless and pure, the ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p><b>that is before the LORD</b><br>The phrase "before the LORD" indicates the presence of God and the sacredness of the offering. It emphasizes that the consecration ceremony is conducted in the sight of God, who is the ultimate authority and witness. This setting apart of the priests is not merely a human ritual but a divine ordinance. It reflects the idea that all service and worship are ultimately directed to God, who is holy and deserving of reverence. This aligns with the New Testament teaching that believers are to live their lives as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is receiving instructions from God on how to consecrate Aaron and his sons as priests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>The first priests of Israel, who are being consecrated for their service to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The sacred place where God dwells among His people and where the consecration ceremony takes place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is giving these specific instructions for worship and consecration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_basket_of_unleavened_bread.htm">The Basket of Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>A collection of bread items used in the consecration ceremony, symbolizing purity and dedication to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_bread.htm">Symbolism of Bread</a></b><br>The use of unleavened bread in the consecration ceremony symbolizes purity and separation from sin.

By presenting it &#8220;along with&#8221; the sacrificial portions (v. 22), Moses demonstrated that the priests&#8217; service rested on God&#8217;s complete provision (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>).<p>&#8226; A loaf symbolizes daily sustenance. The fact that it is set apart for the ordination shows the priest must depend on the Lord first, then serve the people (<a href="/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>; <a href="/john/21-13.htm">John 21:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The loaf was literally placed in the hands of Aaron and his sons during the wave offering (<a href="/leviticus/8-27.htm">Leviticus 8:27</a>). This act publicly affirmed that their ministry would be fueled by what God supplies, not by human ingenuity (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One cake of bread made with oil</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;cake&#8221; is a richer bread mixed with oil (<a href="/exodus/29-2.htm">Exodus 29:2</a>). Oil throughout Scripture points to consecration and the Spirit&#8217;s enabling presence (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Combining flour and oil in a single cake teaches that God fuses the human and the divine in priestly service&#8212;ordinary grain infused with anointing (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>).<p>&#8226; This cake was literally eaten by the priests after the ceremony (<a href="/exodus/29-32.htm">Exodus 29:32</a>). Consuming it signified internalizing God&#8217;s anointing so ministry flows from within (<a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And one wafer</b><p>&#8226; The wafer, a thin, crisp piece, rounds out the trio of breads. Its lightness contrasts with the loaf and the cake, reminding the priests to walk in humility and simplicity (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Three distinct shapes&#8212;loaf, cake, wafer&#8212;underscore the completeness of God&#8217;s provision: sustenance, anointing, and humility (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Each piece was waved before the LORD, then burnt or eaten as directed (<a href="/leviticus/8-28.htm">Leviticus 8:28&#8211;29</a>). The act placed their whole future ministry squarely under divine ownership (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the basket of unleavened bread that is before the LORD</b><p>&#8226; All three breads came from one basket, set &#8220;before the LORD,&#8221; indicating they were prepared ahead of time and kept in His presence (<a href="/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>). Ministry starts in worship, not in human planning (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39&#8211;42</a>).<p>&#8226; Unleavened bread stresses purity&#8212;no yeast of sin or false teaching (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7&#8211;8</a>). The priests were to serve without corruption (<a href="/malachi/2-6.htm">Malachi 2:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the basket remained before the LORD, every subsequent priest could see that holiness is not optional; it is the environment of all true service (<a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/29-23.htm">Exodus 29:23</a> commands that a loaf, a cake with oil, and a wafer be taken from the basket of unleavened bread and presented during the priestly ordination. Literally, these breads formed part of a wave offering that inaugurated Aaron and his sons. Spiritually, the loaf points to God&#8217;s sustaining provision, the oil-rich cake to His empowering consecration, and the wafer to humble dependence. All three came from a basket kept before the LORD, emphasizing purity and constant worship as the foundation of ministry. Together they declare that every priest&#8212;then and now&#8212;serves by God&#8217;s supply, under His anointing, and in His holy presence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">The basket . . . that is before the Lord.</span>--Comp. <a href="/exodus/29-3.htm" title="And you shall put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.">Exodus 29:3</a>.
