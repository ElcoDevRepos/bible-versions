His response sets the stage for the ensuing conflict between God and the Egyptian deities. In ancient Egypt, Pharaoh was considered a god-king, embodying divine authority. His reply reflects his perceived supremacy and the challenge to his authority posed by Moses and Aaron.<p><b>&#8220;Who is the LORD</b><br>Pharaoh's question reveals his ignorance of Yahweh, the God of Israel. In the polytheistic culture of Egypt, where numerous gods were worshiped, the LORD was unknown to Pharaoh. This question underscores the spiritual blindness and arrogance of Pharaoh, who does not recognize the sovereignty of the God of Israel. It also foreshadows the revelation of God's power through the plagues.<p><b>that I should obey His voice</b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to obey highlights the theme of rebellion against divine authority. In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings were expected to heed the commands of their gods. Pharaoh's defiance is not just against Moses and Aaron but against the LORD Himself. This sets up a narrative of divine judgment and deliverance.<p><b>and let Israel go?</b><br>The demand to release the Israelites is central to the Exodus story. Israel's bondage in Egypt is symbolic of sin and oppression, and their liberation is a type of salvation. The request for freedom is not merely a political or social issue but a theological one, as it involves God's covenant with Abraham and His promise to make Israel a great nation.<p><b>I do not know the LORD,</b><br>Pharaoh's ignorance of the LORD is both literal and spiritual. In the biblical narrative, knowing God implies a relationship and acknowledgment of His authority. Pharaoh's statement reflects his spiritual state and sets the stage for God to demonstrate His power and make His name known through the plagues and the eventual Exodus.<p><b>and I will not let Israel go.&#8221;</b><br>Pharaoh's refusal is a direct challenge to God's command. This obstinacy is a recurring theme in the narrative, leading to the hardening of Pharaoh's heart and the subsequent plagues. It illustrates the conflict between human will and divine purpose, and the lengths to which God will go to fulfill His promises to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, representing the epitome of earthly power and authority.
