In the context of the Israelites entering the Promised Land, it reflects God's wisdom in allowing them to grow in strength and numbers before fully occupying the land. This gradual approach can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual growth, where believers are transformed over time rather than instantaneously. It also highlights God's patience and strategic planning.<p><b>I will drive them out ahead of you</b><br>God promises to actively participate in the removal of the current inhabitants of the land. This divine intervention underscores the belief that God is sovereign and directly involved in the affairs of His people. Historically, the Canaanites were known for their fortified cities and military prowess, making divine assistance crucial for the Israelites. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God fighting for His people, as seen in other passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/1-30.htm">Deuteronomy 1:30</a> and <a href="/joshua/23-9.htm">Joshua 23:9</a>.<p><b>until you become fruitful</b><br>The term "fruitful" suggests not only population growth but also spiritual and material prosperity. It implies that the Israelites needed to develop the capacity to manage and sustain the land they were to inherit. This concept of fruitfulness is echoed in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where God commands humanity to be fruitful and multiply, indicating a return to the original blessing and purpose for humanity.<p><b>and possess the land</b><br>Possession of the land is a central theme in the covenant between God and Israel. It signifies the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The land is not just a physical territory but a place where the Israelites can live out their covenant relationship with God. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate rest and inheritance believers find in Christ, as discussed in <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>, where the Promised Land is seen as a type of the eternal rest found in Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker of the promise, emphasizing His sovereignty and plan for the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's promise, tasked with taking possession of the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, inhabited by various nations that God promises to drive out.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_of_canaan.htm">Nations of Canaan</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the land that God will gradually remove to make way for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_timing_is_perfect.htm">God's Timing is Perfect</a></b><br>Trust in God's timing, as He knows what is best for us.
