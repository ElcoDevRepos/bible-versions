The "great power" refers to the parting of the Red Sea and the subsequent destruction of the Egyptian army. This event is a demonstration of God's sovereignty and might, serving as a pivotal moment in Israel's history. It is a fulfillment of God's promise to deliver His people from bondage (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). The power displayed here is a testament to God's ability to intervene in human history and alter the natural order for His purposes.<p><b>that the LORD had exercised over the Egyptians,</b><br>The Egyptians were the oppressors of the Israelites, and God's actions against them were both a judgment and a deliverance. This phrase underscores the divine retribution against Pharaoh and his army, who had defied God's command to let His people go (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>). The plagues and the final destruction at the Red Sea serve as a warning against resisting God's will. This event is also a type of Christ's victory over sin and death, as God delivers His people from slavery, just as Christ delivers believers from the bondage of sin.<p><b>the people feared the LORD</b><br>The fear mentioned here is one of reverence and awe, not terror. It reflects a recognition of God's holiness and power. This reverence is a foundational aspect of the Israelites' relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom." This fear leads to obedience and worship, setting the stage for the covenant relationship that will be established at Mount Sinai.<p><b>and believed in Him</b><br>This belief signifies trust and faith in God's promises and His ability to fulfill them. It marks a turning point for the Israelites, who had previously doubted and complained (<a href="/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11-12</a>). Their faith is now strengthened by witnessing God's deliverance. This belief is essential for their identity as God's chosen people and is echoed in the New Testament, where faith in God is central to the Christian life (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p><b>and in His servant Moses.</b><br>Moses is affirmed as God's chosen leader and prophet. His role as mediator between God and the people is solidified through this event. Moses is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The people's belief in Moses is crucial for the journey ahead, as he will lead them through the wilderness and deliver God's laws. Moses' leadership is validated by the signs and wonders performed through him, establishing his authority and the divine origin of his mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the Israelites, who were enslaved in Egypt and led out by Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who demonstrated His power and faithfulness by delivering the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt, particularly the army that pursued the Israelites and was defeated at the Red Sea.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The servant of God and leader of the Israelites, chosen to lead them out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The body of water that God miraculously parted to allow the Israelites to escape from the pursuing Egyptian army.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god.htm">The Power of God</a></b><br>Recognize and trust in God's mighty power to deliver and protect His people, as demonstrated in the miraculous events at the Red Sea.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_and_reverence.htm">Fear and Reverence</a></b><br>Develop a healthy fear and reverence for the Lord, acknowledging His authority and sovereignty over all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_leadership.htm">Faith in Leadership</a></b><br>Understand the importance of trusting in God's appointed leaders, as the Israelites did with Moses, while discerning their alignment with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witnessing_god's_works.htm">Witnessing God's Works</a></b><br>Reflect on personal experiences of God's intervention and allow these to strengthen your faith and commitment to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/belief_and_obedience.htm">Belief and Obedience</a></b><br>Emphasize the connection between belief in God and obedience to His commands, as seen in the Israelites' response to God's deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_14_31_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 14:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_14_31_God_s_power_daily_faith.htm">How does Exodus 14:31 demonstrate God's power and inspire your daily faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_do_you_fear_the_LORD_today.htm">What does "feared the LORD" mean in the context of your life today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_deepen_faith_like_Israel_s.htm">How can you "believe in the LORD" more deeply, as Israel did here?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Exodus_14_31_to_Daniel_in_the_lions_den.htm">Connect Exodus 14:31 with another Bible story showing God's deliverance.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Israelites_trust_to_today.htm">How can you apply the Israelites' trust in God to current challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_14_31_God_s_power_over_all.htm">How does Exodus 14:31 demonstrate God's power and authority over nature and nations?

The spirit of the nation was effectually broken for the time; and it was not till after several reigns, and an interval of anarchy, that there was a revival. The king himself probably despaired of effecting anything against a foe that was supernaturally protected; and the army, having lost the flower of the chariot force, on which it mainly depended for success, desired no further contest. The Israelites, as will be seen further on, in their rapid march to Sinai avoided the Egyptian settlements, and having once reached the Sinaitic region, they were beyond the dominion of Egypt, and for forty years quite out of the path of Egyptian conquest. The episode in the life of the nation begun by the descent of Jacob into Egypt now terminated, and a fresh beginning was made. In the open air of the desert, cut off from all other races, admitted to close communion with Jehovah, the people entered upon that new and higher existence which culminated in the teaching of the prophets, in the noble struggles of Ezra and Nehemiah, and in the memorable stand on behalf of religious truth and national independence which was made by the Maccabees.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Israel saw that great work</span>. The "work" was, at the least, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the (almost) entire destruction of that arm of the service - the chariot force-on which the Egyptian kings mainly relied for success in all their wars; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the defeat and disgrace of the Egyptian king himself, in an expedition for which he was alone responsible, involving permanent discredit to his military capacity, and naturally tending to shake his authority over his subjects. It secured the Israelites from further persecution, mainly by the reminiscences which it left behind, but partly also by removing them to a distance from the natural course of Egyptian warlike or commercial movement. Though Egypt had mining establishments in the Sinaitic peninsula, at Wady-Magharah and Sarabit-el-Khadim, yet as these were avoided by the Israelites on their way to Sinai, and never afterwards approached, there naturally was no collision between them and the Pharaonic garrisons at those sites. Still more remote were they during their wanderings from the Egyptian military route, which proceeded along the coast from Pelusium to Gaza, and then ran northwards through the Shephelah. Thus the Passage of the Red Sea brought one phase in the life of the people to an end, and was the commencement of another. It separated them from Egypt until the time came when their king would hold communication with its monarch on equal terms (<a href="/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>). It secured their independence, and raised them at once into a nation. It further caused them to exchange the artificial life of a bureaucratical and convention-loving community for the open space and untrammelled freedom of the desert. It thus rejuvenated and reinvigorated the race, and enabled them to enter on that career of conquest which culminated in the Kingdom - may we not say the Empire? - of David. some writers have supposed that the blow to the Egyptian power was greater than here represented. They believe the entire warrior caste or class to have taken part in the expedition, and to have been destroyed in the Red Sea Thus they describe the calamity as "the total annihilation of the whole military force of the Egyptians" (Kalisch). They also believe the Pharaoh to have perished with his host. To the present writer it seems that the former opinion is contrary both to the text of Scripture, and to the after course of Egyptian history, for it is agreed on all hands that Egypt continued nearly as powerful as before, while the latter he regards as at least exceedingly doubtful. <a href="/psalms/86-15.htm">Psalm 86:15</a>, is quoted as asserting it;
