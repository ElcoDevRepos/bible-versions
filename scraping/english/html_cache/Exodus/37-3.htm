Gold, a symbol of purity and divinity, was used extensively in the Tabernacle, reflecting the holiness and majesty of God. The use of gold also points to the wealth and resources that the Israelites had, likely acquired from the Egyptians during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>). The number four often represents universality or completeness in the Bible, suggesting the comprehensive nature of God's covenant with His people.<p><b>for its four feet</b><br>The mention of "four feet" indicates the practical design of the Ark of the Covenant, allowing it to be carried. The feet would have been part of the structure that supported the Ark, ensuring stability and mobility. This design reflects the need for the Ark to be portable as the Israelites journeyed through the wilderness. The Ark's mobility symbolizes God's presence with His people wherever they go, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>).<p><b>two rings on one side and two on the other</b><br>The placement of the rings on either side of the Ark allowed for poles to be inserted, facilitating its transport. This method of carrying the Ark underscores the reverence and care required in handling sacred objects, as later emphasized in the incident with Uzzah (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>). The symmetry of the design reflects the order and precision that God commands in worship and service. This balance can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly embodies both grace and truth (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), and whose sacrifice allows believers to approach God with reverence and awe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the Ark of the Covenant.

Bezalel obeys the earlier blueprint (<a href="/exodus/25-12.htm">Exodus 25:12</a>), showing that God&#8217;s directions are not suggestions but commands meant to be followed precisely (cf. <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>).<p>&#8211; Gold speaks of purity and worth, reminding the people that everything connected to God&#8217;s presence deserves the best (cf. <a href="/revelation/21-21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>).<p>&#8211; Casting, rather than hammering, creates rings that are uniform and strong, stressing permanence&#8212;God&#8217;s instructions endure (cf. <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for its four feet</b><p>&#8211; The Ark rested on feet, keeping the sacred chest from sitting directly on the ground; holiness is never to be treated as common (cf. <a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>).<p>&#8211; The feet allow space so that the poles could slide through the rings without scraping the floor, reducing the risk of accidental touch (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8211; God designed practical safeguards that reflect His care for both His glory and His people&#8217;s safety (cf. <a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>two rings on one side</b><p>&#8211; Balance matters; two rings distribute weight evenly so the Ark travels steady through the wilderness (cf. <a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>).<p>&#8211; The detail signals teamwork: priests on each side share the load, illustrating body ministry within the covenant community (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s presence goes with His people, not behind them; the rings enable forward motion, pointing to a God who leads (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/1-30.htm">Deuteronomy 1:30&#8211;33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and two on the other</b><p>&#8211; Symmetry underscores order; God is not the author of confusion (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p>&#8211; Having the same number of rings on each side eliminates favoritism and highlights unity between tribes bearing the Ark (cf. <a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8211; Every movement of the Ark required all four rings, teaching that God&#8217;s purposes advance when His people operate together in obedience (cf. <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/37-3.htm">Exodus 37:3</a> shows meticulous obedience to God&#8217;s design: four cast-gold rings placed at the Ark&#8217;s feet&#8212;two on each side&#8212;guarantee secure, balanced, and reverent transport of God&#8217;s throne among His people. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s holiness demands our best, His instructions deserve exact attention, and His presence travels with a united, obedient community.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/37-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he cast</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1465;&#1443;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;&#7779;&#333;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
