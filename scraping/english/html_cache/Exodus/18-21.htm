The selection of "capable men" emphasizes the need for individuals with the necessary skills and wisdom to lead effectively. This principle of selecting qualified leaders is echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>, where the apostles instruct the early church to choose men full of the Spirit and wisdom to oversee certain tasks.<p><b>God-fearing, trustworthy men who are averse to dishonest gain.</b><br>The criteria for leadership include being "God-fearing," which implies a reverence and respect for God's laws and commands. Trustworthiness is crucial for maintaining integrity and justice.

It reflects an organized approach to leadership that can be seen in other parts of the Bible, such as the division of labor among the Levites in <a href="/numbers/3.htm">Numbers 3</a>.

This divinely endorsed structure safeguards justice, nurtures people, and enables sustained ministry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Provide out of all the people able men.</span>--This was the gist of Jethro's advice. It seems somewhat surprising that it should have been needed. In Egypt, as in all other settled governments, while the king was the fountain of justice, it was customary for him to delegate the duty of hearing causes to officials of different ranks, who decided in this or that class of complaints. In Arabia a similar practice no doubt prevailed. Jethro himself had his subordinates, the head men of the various clans or families, who discharged judicial functions in "small matters," and thereby greatly lightened the burthen which would otherwise have rested upon his shoulders. His advice to Moses was simply that he should adopt this generally established system--one which belongs to a very early period in the history of nations.<p>Jethro's definition of "able men"--men, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>fitted to exercise the judicial office--is interesting. He requires them to be (1) God-fearing, (2) truthful, and (3) men of integrity. The second and third requirements would approve themselves to men of all times and countries. The first would generally be deemed superfluous. But it really lies at the root of all excellence of character, and is the point of greatest importance.<p><span class= "bld">Rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds</span>.--An organisation of the entire people on a decimal system is implied in the arrangement suggested. Such an organisation may not improbably have existed at the same in connection with the march and the encamping. See the Comment on <a href="/exodus/13-18.htm" title="But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 13:18</a>.) Jethro thought that it might be utilised for judicial purposes. One an out of ten might be competent to judge in "small matters." If either party were dissatisfied, there might be an appeal to the "ruler of fifty"--from him the "ruler of an hundred," and then to the "ruler<p>Of a thousand." In all ordinary disputes this would suffice, and the contest would not require to be carried further.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Able men</span>. Literally, "men of might" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of capacity or ability - men competent for the office of judge; who are further defined to be, such as possess the three qualities of piety, veracity, and strict honesty, or incorruptness. Jethro's conception of the true judicial character leaves little to be desired. If among every ten Israelites there was one such person, the moral condition of the nation cannot have been so much depressed by the Egyptian servitude as is sometimes represented. <span class="cmt_word">Place such over</span> <span class="cmt_word">them to be rulers of thousands,</span> etc. A decimal organisation naturally presents itself to men's minds as the simplest in a simple state of society, and was probably already in use among the Arab tribes with whom Jethro was familiar. The graduated series - rulers of tens, of fifties, of hundreds, and of thousands, implies a power of three-fold appeal, from the "ruler of ten" to the "ruler of fifty" - from him to the "ruler of a hundred" - and from him to the "ruler of a thousand." Whether there was an appeal from the last-named to Moses, is doubtful.
