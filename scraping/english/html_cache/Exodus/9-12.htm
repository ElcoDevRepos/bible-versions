In the context of the plagues, it shows God's sovereignty over human affairs. The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a recurring theme in Exodus, emphasizing God's control and the fulfillment of His purposes. This hardening can be seen as a judicial act, where God confirms Pharaoh in his own stubbornness. It also serves to demonstrate God's power and glory, as seen in <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17-18</a>, where Paul discusses God's right to show mercy or harden whom He wills. Theologically, this raises questions about free will and divine sovereignty, which have been debated throughout church history.<p><b>and he would not listen to them</b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to listen to Moses and Aaron is a direct result of his hardened heart. This stubbornness is a key factor in the narrative, leading to the escalation of plagues. It highlights the spiritual blindness and pride that can prevent individuals from responding to God's message. In a broader biblical context, this can be compared to the parables of Jesus, where those who have hardened hearts are unable to perceive the truth (<a href="/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14-15</a>). Pharaoh's resistance serves as a warning against the dangers of pride and disobedience to God's commands.<p><b>just as the LORD had said to Moses</b><br>This phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's word and His foreknowledge. God had previously informed Moses that Pharaoh would not easily let the Israelites go (<a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>). This assurance to Moses is a reminder of God's omniscience and the certainty of His plans. It also serves to strengthen Moses' faith and resolve, knowing that the unfolding events are part of God's divine plan. This theme of prophecy and fulfillment is prevalent throughout Scripture, reinforcing the reliability and authority of God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who demonstrates His power and sovereignty over Egypt and its gods.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened by God, leading to his refusal to release the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, and the setting for the plagues that demonstrate God's power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plagues.htm">The Plagues</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments on Egypt, designed to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of all events, including the hearts of rulers and nations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/human_responsibility.htm">Human Responsibility</a></b><br>While God hardens hearts, individuals are still responsible for their responses to God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment_and_mercy.htm">Divine Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>Understand that God's judgments serve a purpose in His redemptive plan, often leading to opportunities for repentance and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_call.htm">Obedience to God's Call</a></b><br>Like Moses, we are called to obey God's instructions, even when facing opposition or hard-heartedness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_a_hardened_heart.htm">The Danger of a Hardened Heart</a></b><br>Guard against hardening your heart to God's voice, remaining open and responsive to His leading.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_9_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 9:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_12_God_s_control_over_Pharaoh.htm">How does Exodus 9:12 demonstrate God's sovereignty over Pharaoh's heart?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Insights_on_God_s_justice_in_Exodus_9_12.htm">What can we learn about God's justice from Exodus 9:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_12_Romans_9_17-18_link.htm">How does Exodus 9:12 connect to Romans 9:17-18 about God's purpose?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Exodus_9_12_on_daily_trust.htm">How should understanding God's control in Exodus 9:12 affect our daily trust?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Exodus_9_12_s_lesson_today.htm">How can we apply the lesson of divine sovereignty from Exodus 9:12 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_harden_Pharaoh_s_heart_6.htm">Why did God harden Pharaoh's heart in Exodus 9:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Does_divine_hardening_negate_free_will.htm">Does God hardening hearts contradict free will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_12_God_s_love_and_mercy.htm">How does Exodus 9:12 align with God's nature of love and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_harden_pharaoh's_heart_if_free_will.htm">If God created humans with free will, why does He harden Pharaoh&#8217;s heart (Exodus 9:12)?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_exodus_32_align_with_aaron's_role.htm">How does the portrayal of Aaron's role in Exodus 32 align with other biblical depictions of him, and does it reveal inconsistencies across different texts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/if_god_hardened_pharaoh's_heart,_why_blame_him.htm">If Exodus 14:17 says God hardened Pharaoh&#8217;s heart, how can Pharaoh be held responsible for his actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_harden_hearts.htm">Why does God cause people's hearts to harden?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Exodus 9:12 Mean</div><b>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh&#8217;s heart</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereign action is front-and-center. Long before the plagues began, the LORD told Moses, &#8220;I will harden his heart&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>; 7:3). <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17-18</a> echoes the same truth: &#8220;Therefore God has mercy on whom He wants to have mercy, and He hardens whom He wants to harden.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The hardening does not make Pharaoh a puppet; it confirms him in the rebellion he already loves. Earlier verses show Pharaoh hardening his own heart (<a href="/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15, 19</a>). <a href="/joshua/11-20.htm">Joshua 11:20</a> offers a parallel instance where God&#8217;s hardening of Canaanite kings sealed a judgment they had earned.<p>&#8226; By hardening Pharaoh, the LORD magnifies His glory. &#8220;I raised you up&#8230;that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth&#8221; (<a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>).

Spurning prophetic warning is a hallmark of hardened hearts (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>; <a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>).<p>&#8226; Pharaoh&#8217;s refusal is persistent: after the frogs (<a href="/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15</a>), after the gnats (8:19), after the hail (9:34). The pattern underlines that miraculous signs alone cannot soften a will that resists God.<p>&#8226; This deafness illustrates a sobering principle: when people continually reject truth, God may hand them over to deeper deception (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>).

Pharaoh&#8217;s hardened heart, his refusal to listen, and the perfect consistency of God&#8217;s forecasts all weave into a single tapestry that exalts the LORD&#8217;s power and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh.</span>--The judicial punitive hardening of Pharaoh's heart by God Himself now began.
