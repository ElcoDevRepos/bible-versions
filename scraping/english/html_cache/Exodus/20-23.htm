In the context of the ancient Near East, polytheism was prevalent, with many cultures worshiping a pantheon of gods. The Israelites, having recently been delivered from Egypt, would have been familiar with Egyptian deities. This command underscores the monotheistic nature of the Israelite faith, setting it apart from surrounding nations. Theologically, this reflects the first commandment, "You shall have no other gods before Me," reinforcing the idea that God alone is worthy of worship. This exclusivity is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus affirms the greatest commandment is to love God with all one's heart, soul, and mind (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).<p><b>you are not to make for yourselves gods of silver or gold.</b><br>This prohibition against creating idols of silver or gold addresses the common practice of crafting physical representations of deities. In ancient cultures, such idols were often made from precious metals, signifying their importance and the wealth of the worshipers. The Israelites are warned against this practice, as it contradicts the nature of God, who is spirit and cannot be contained or represented by material objects. This command is further elaborated in the second commandment, which forbids the making of graven images. The New Testament continues this theme, with Paul warning against idolatry in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14</a>. Theologically, this points to the sufficiency and supremacy of God, who does not require physical representation, and foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who is the image of the invisible God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God who delivered the Israelites from Egypt and gave them the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are receiving the Law at Mount Sinai.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments and other laws for the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, who received the Law from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The act of worshiping idols or false gods, which is strictly prohibited by God in this commandment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/exclusive_worship.htm">Exclusive Worship</a></b><br>God demands exclusive worship.

Gods of silver and gods of gold are specially forbidden, because it was to idolatry of this kind that the Israelites were specially inclined. The golden calf is no isolated phenomenon. Molten images of gods, generally of silver, sometimes of gold, were objects of worship to Israel throughout the ages which preceded the Captivity. Jeroboam set up molten images at Dan and Bethel (Kings 14:9; <a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm" title="And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.">2Kings 17:16</a>). Baal was worshipped under the semblance of a molten image (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-2.htm" title="For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.">2Chronicles 28:2</a>) as were probably Ashtaroth, Chemosh, and Moloch. The animal worship of the Egyptians had no attractions for the Hebrews; they did not offer to images of stone or marble, like the Assyrians or the Greeks; much less was it their habit to "bow down to stocks," like so many of the heathen nations around them. The "molten image," generally completed by a certain amount of graving, was the form of idol which had most charms for them, and the more precious the material the more satisfied were they to worship it. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/30-22.htm" title="You shall defile also the covering of your graven images of silver, and the ornament of your molten images of gold: you shall cast them away as a menstruous cloth; you shall say to it, Get you hence.">Isaiah 30:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-17.htm" title="They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, You are our gods.">Isaiah 42:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-14.htm" title="Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.">Jeremiah 10:14</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-2.htm" title="And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.">Hosea 13:2</a>, &c.). Occasionally indeed they overlaid wood or stone with plates of gold or silver, to produce an idol (<a href="/habakkuk/2-19.htm" title="Woe to him that said to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the middle of it.">Habakkuk 2:19</a>); but such images were at once less common and held in less account. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not make with me gods of silver</span>, etc. This is a repetition, in part, of the second commandment, and can only be accounted for by the prohibition being specially needed. The first idea of the Israelites, when they considered that Moses had deserted them, was to make a golden calf for a god. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/20-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You are not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to make</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;a&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#363;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural &#124;
