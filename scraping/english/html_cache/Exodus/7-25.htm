This period allowed the Egyptians to experience the full impact of the first plague, the turning of the Nile into blood. It also provided time for Pharaoh to reconsider his stance against letting the Israelites go, highlighting God's patience and the opportunity for repentance.<p><b>after the LORD had struck the Nile.</b><br>The Nile River was central to Egyptian life, serving as a source of sustenance, transportation, and economic prosperity. By striking the Nile, God demonstrated His power over the Egyptian gods, particularly Hapi, the god of the Nile. This act was a direct challenge to the Egyptian belief system and a demonstration of God's supremacy. The striking of the Nile can also be seen as a type of judgment, foreshadowing the ultimate judgment and deliverance found in Jesus Christ. The plagues, beginning with the Nile, serve as a precursor to the final deliverance of God's people, paralleling the deliverance from sin through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who demonstrates His power and sovereignty over creation and the gods of Egypt through the plagues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>God's chosen leaders to confront Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
