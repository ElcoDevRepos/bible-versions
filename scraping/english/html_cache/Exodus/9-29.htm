Moses, as the leader of the Israelites, acts as God's spokesperson. This interaction highlights the ongoing confrontation between God's representative and the Egyptian ruler, emphasizing the theme of divine authority versus human authority.<p><b>When I have left the city</b><br>Moses' departure from the city signifies a physical and symbolic separation from the Egyptian center of power. It underscores the distinction between the Israelites and the Egyptians, as well as the sanctity of Moses' mission. The city, likely Pi-Ramesses or another major Egyptian city, represents the heart of Pharaoh's domain.<p><b>I will spread out my hands to the LORD</b><br>The act of spreading out hands is a gesture of prayer and supplication, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. It signifies Moses' reliance on divine intervention. This posture is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22</a>, where Solomon spreads his hands in prayer at the dedication of the temple.<p><b>The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail</b><br>This promise of cessation of the plague demonstrates God's control over nature, contrasting with the Egyptian gods who were believed to govern natural phenomena. The plagues serve as judgments against the gods of Egypt, as seen in <a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>, where God executes judgment on all the gods of Egypt.<p><b>so that you may know that the earth is the LORD&#8217;s</b><br>This statement underscores the central theme of the Exodus narrative: the demonstration of God's sovereignty over all creation. It echoes the declaration in <a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>, "The earth is the LORD&#8217;s, and everything in it."

"The city" is probably Tanis (Zoan). We may gather from the expression of this verse, and again of verse 33, that Moses and Aaron did not live in the city, but in the country with the other Israelites. When it was necessary for them to have an interview with the king, they sought the city: when their interview was over they quitted it. To obtain for Pharaoh a speedy accomplishment of his wish, Moses undertakes to pray for the removal of the plague as soon as he is outside the city walls. <span class="cmt_word">That thou mayest know that the earth is the Lord's</span>. The phrase used is ambiguous. It may mean either "that the <span class="accented">earth</span> is Jehovah's," or "that the land (of Egypt) is his." On the whole, perhaps the former rendering is the best. The other plagues sufficiently showed that Egypt was Jehovah's; this, which came from the open heaven that surrounds and embraces the whole world, indicated that the entire earth was his.
