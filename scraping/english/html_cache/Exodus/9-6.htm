In the context of the plagues, it underscores God's sovereignty and power over creation. The plagues were a direct challenge to the Egyptian gods, demonstrating that the God of Israel was the true God. This phrase also emphasizes the fulfillment of God's word, as He had previously warned Pharaoh through Moses about the impending plague on the livestock.<p><b>All the livestock of the Egyptians died,</b><br>This part of the verse indicates the severity of the plague. The death of all Egyptian livestock would have had devastating economic and social impacts, as livestock were essential for agriculture, transportation, and religious sacrifices. This plague specifically targeted the Egyptians, further demonstrating God's ability to distinguish between His people and their oppressors. The death of the livestock can also be seen as a judgment against the Egyptian god Apis, who was depicted as a bull and symbolized fertility and strength.<p><b>but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died.</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine protection over the Israelites, showcasing God's covenant faithfulness. It serves as a sign of distinction between the Egyptians and the Israelites, reinforcing the theme of God's chosen people. This protection is a precursor to the Passover, where God would again distinguish between the Israelites and Egyptians. The preservation of Israelite livestock also ensured that they had the necessary resources for their journey out of Egypt and for future sacrifices to God. This distinction is a type of Christ, who provides salvation and protection to those who belong to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who demonstrates His power and sovereignty over Egypt and its gods through the plagues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, who acts as God's messenger to Pharaoh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened against letting the Israelites go.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt, who suffer the consequences of Pharaoh's hardened heart.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, living in Egypt, who are protected by God during the plagues.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God demonstrates His supreme power over nature and the false gods of Egypt.

Whatever He promises, He performs&#8212;no delays, no revisions.<p>&#8226; Here the fulfillment highlights God&#8217;s supremacy over Pharaoh, whose earlier boasts and counter-magic had failed (<a href="/exodus/8-18.htm">Exodus 8:18&#8211;19</a>). The Lord alone controls life and death.<p>&#8226; Believers can rest in the same certainty today: &#8220;Not one of all the good promises the LORD had made to the house of Israel failed; everything was fulfilled&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the livestock of the Egyptians died</b><p>&#8226; Totality of judgment: every horse, donkey, camel, cattle, sheep, and goat in Egyptian fields fell (<a href="/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>). <a href="/psalms/78-48.htm">Psalm 78:48</a> later recalls that &#8220;He abandoned their cattle to the hail and their livestock to bolts of lightning.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Economic ruin: animals pulled plows, transported goods, and provided food; losing them crippled agriculture and commerce (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-31.htm">Deuteronomy 28:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Religious defeat: Egyptians revered bovine deities such as Apis and Hathor.
