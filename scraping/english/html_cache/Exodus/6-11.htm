Pharaoh, as the king of Egypt, was considered a god by his people, making this directive a confrontation between the God of Israel and the gods of Egypt. Historically, Pharaohs were seen as divine rulers, and this sets the stage for the ensuing plagues, which demonstrate the power of the God of Israel over the Egyptian deities. This phrase also highlights Moses' role as a prophet and mediator, a type of Christ who would later serve as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>to let the Israelites go</b><br>The demand for the Israelites' release is central to the narrative of Exodus. It signifies God's intention to fulfill His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob by delivering their descendants from bondage. Theologically, this liberation prefigures the salvation offered through Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from the bondage of sin. The Israelites' exodus from Egypt is a foundational event in Jewish history, symbolizing freedom and God's faithfulness.<p><b>out of his land</b><br>The phrase "out of his land" underscores the complete separation God intends for His people from Egypt, a land associated with idolatry and oppression. This separation is not just physical but spiritual, as God calls His people to be distinct and holy. The land of Egypt, with its rich archaeological history, was a place of great power and wealth, yet it was not the land promised to the descendants of Abraham. This call to leave Egypt foreshadows the Christian call to leave behind the world and its ways, seeking a heavenly homeland as described in <a href="/hebrews/11-16.htm">Hebrews 11:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central human figure in this passage, Moses is chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.

The first asked only for permission to enter the wilderness, much of which was within the limits of Egypt; the second was a demand that the Israelites should be allowed "to go out of the land." Such is the way of Providence generally. If we refuse a light cross, a heavier cross is laid on us. If we will not close with the Sybil on the first occasion, she offers us a worse bargain on the second.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Out of his land</span>.

The children of Israel are to be let go altogether "out of the land." So generally, if God lays a light burthen upon us and we refuse it, we may expect him to exchange our light burthen for a heavier one. We had better accept the first cross he offers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/6-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Pharaoh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Egypt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;r&#257;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4714.htm">Strong's 4714: </a> </span><span class="str2">Egypt -- a son of Ham, also his descendants and their country in Northwest Africa</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to let the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">go out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#238;&#183;&#353;al&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Conjunctive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his land.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8217;ar&#183;&#7779;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/6-11.htm">OT Law: Exodus 6:11 Go in speak to Pharaoh king (Exo.
