This tent was set up outside the camp as a place where Moses would meet with God, symbolizing a separation from the sin of the people (<a href="/exodus/33-7.htm">Exodus 33:7</a>). The tent served as a precursor to the Tabernacle, which would later be constructed as a more permanent dwelling place for God's presence among the Israelites. Moses' actions here foreshadow Christ's role as the mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>all the people would stand at the entrances to their own tents</b><br>The people's act of standing at their tent entrances signifies respect and reverence for Moses' role as their leader and mediator. This communal act of standing also reflects a shared acknowledgment of the importance of Moses' communication with God. In ancient Near Eastern culture, standing was a common posture of respect and attentiveness, similar to how one might stand in the presence of a king or dignitary.<p><b>and watch Moses until he entered the tent</b><br>The Israelites' watching Moses indicates their awareness of the significance of his meetings with God. This act of watching can be seen as a form of participation in the sacred event, even from a distance. It highlights the people's dependence on Moses for guidance and revelation from God. This scene can be connected to the anticipation of the coming Messiah, who would enter into the presence of God on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>). Moses' role here is a type of Christ, who would ultimately fulfill the role of mediator and intercessor for all people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the mediator between God and His people.

This was a literal, physical location where he regularly sought the LORD.<p>- His habit of leaving the camp communicated several truths:<p>&#8226; Holiness is separate from sin (<a href="/bsb/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a> shows Israel&#8217;s recent idolatry).<p>&#8226; Leadership begins with personal communion with God (compare <a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>; <a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>).<p>- The word &#8220;whenever&#8221; signals consistency. Moses did not seek God sporadically; he modeled steadfast devotion, echoing principles later seen in <a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the people would stand at the entrances to their own tents</b><p>- The entire congregation responded physically, rising and standing. Their posture showed reverence, much like Israel standing to hear the Law read in <a href="/nehemiah/8-5.htm">Nehemiah 8:5</a>.<p>- Remaining at &#8220;their own tents&#8221; kept order in the camp while still allowing participation. It mirrors God&#8217;s design that worship involves both community and personal responsibility (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p>- This scene underscores corporate sensitivity to God&#8217;s movements: when the leader sought the LORD, the people instinctively acknowledged it (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/12-16.htm">1 Samuel 12:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And watch Moses until he entered the tent</b><p>- Their eyes followed Moses because he was their mediator (<a href="/exodus/20-19.htm">Exodus 20:19</a>). Watching reflected dependence: as Moses went in, they trusted he would intercede (<a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a>).<p>- The focus on Moses foreshadows the ultimate Mediator, Christ, whom believers &#8220;fix their eyes on&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<p>- Waiting &#8220;until he entered&#8221; suggests anticipation of divine disclosure. A similar hush falls before God speaks in <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a> and <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11-13</a>.<p>- The verse, taken literally, paints a vivid picture of a people learning a rhythm of expectancy whenever fellowship with God was pursued.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/33-8.htm">Exodus 33:8</a> portrays a daily scene where Moses&#8217; steady pursuit of God drew communal attention, respect, and expectation. His outward walk to the tent highlighted separation unto holiness; the people&#8217;s standing displayed reverence; their watchfulness revealed reliance on their mediator. Together, these actions teach the necessity of consistent leadership prayer, collective sensitivity to God&#8217;s presence, and expectant faith that God will speak when sought.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">When Moses went out . . . all the people rose up.</span>--As a mark of respect and reverence.
