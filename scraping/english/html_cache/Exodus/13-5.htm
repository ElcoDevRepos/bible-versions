The mention of these specific groups highlights the diverse inhabitants of Canaan at the time. Historically, these tribes were known for their fortified cities and advanced cultures. Theologically, the conquest of these peoples symbolizes God's judgment on their idolatry and immorality, as well as His faithfulness to Israel. The presence of these nations also sets the stage for Israel's future challenges in maintaining purity and faithfulness to God amidst pagan influences.<p><b>the land He swore to your fathers that He would give you,</b><br>This part emphasizes the covenantal promise God made to the patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It underscores God's faithfulness and the certainty of His promises. The land is not just a geographical location but a tangible sign of God's enduring covenant. This promise is reiterated throughout Genesis (e.g., <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 15</a>:18-21) and serves as a foundation for Israel's identity and hope.<p><b>a land flowing with milk and honey&#8212;</b><br>This description paints a picture of abundance and prosperity. "Milk and honey" symbolize fertility and the richness of the land, indicating that it is a place where the Israelites can thrive. This phrase is used multiple times in the Pentateuch to describe the Promised Land (e.g., <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>, <a href="/numbers/13-27.htm">Numbers 13:27</a>). It contrasts with the Israelites' experience in Egypt and the wilderness, highlighting the blessings awaiting them.<p><b>you shall keep this service in this month.</b><br>The "service" refers to the observance of Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which commemorate Israel's deliverance from Egypt. This command underscores the importance of remembering God's salvation and maintaining a distinct identity as His people. The timing "in this month" refers to the month of Abib (later called Nisan), marking the beginning of the religious calendar for Israel. This observance is a perpetual reminder of God's mighty acts and a call to faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The

The other two were the Perizzites and the Girgashites, which seem to have been the least important. The most important were the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites; and these are consequently almost always placed first. At the time of the Exodus, and for many centuries afterwards, the actually most powerful nation would seem to have been that of the Hittites.
