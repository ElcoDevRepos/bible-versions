The Levites were later set apart for religious duties and service in the Tabernacle, and eventually the Temple. This lineage is significant as it establishes Moses' priestly heritage, foreshadowing his role as a mediator between God and the Israelites. The Levites did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes, emphasizing their unique role in Israelite society. This connection to the tribe of Levi also prefigures the priesthood of Christ, who serves as the ultimate High Priest.<p><b>married a Levite woman</b><br>Marriage within the same tribe was common in ancient Israel, often to preserve tribal identity and inheritance. The Levite woman here is Jochebed, who is later named in <a href="/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a>. This union highlights the continuity of the Levitical line and the preservation of God's chosen people. The marriage of two Levites underscores the importance of maintaining religious and cultural identity, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. This also points to the sanctity of marriage and family as foundational to God's covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_the_house_of_levi.htm">The Man of the House of Levi</a></b><br>This refers to Amram, who is later identified as the father of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

Some years before the Pharaoh issued his edict for the general destruction of the Hebrew male children, Amram of the tribe of Levi, had married Jochebed, his kinswoman (<a href="/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a>). They had already had two children - Miriam, a daughter, born probably soon after the marriage, and Aaron, a son, born some twelve years later. Soon after the issue of the edict, Jochebed gave birth to her third child, a son, who therefore came under its terms. Knowing as she did what fate was in store for him, if his existence became known to the Egyptians, she "hid him three months." Then, despairing of being able to keep him concealed much longer, she devised the plan related in vers. 3-4, which proved successful. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There went a man</span>.
