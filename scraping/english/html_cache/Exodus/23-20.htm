The "angel" here is often interpreted as a theophany, a manifestation of God Himself, or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ, known as a Christophany. This aligns with other instances in the Old Testament where the "Angel of the Lord" speaks as God (e.g., <a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a>, <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-6</a>). The angel's role is to lead and protect, emphasizing God's active involvement in the journey of the Israelites. The use of "Behold" serves as a call to attention, underscoring the importance of the message.<p><b>to protect you along the way</b><br>Protection is a central theme in the wilderness journey of the Israelites. This divine protection is not merely physical but also spiritual, safeguarding the Israelites from external threats and internal rebellion. The journey through the wilderness was fraught with danger, including hostile nations and harsh environmental conditions. This promise of protection reassures the Israelites of God's constant presence and care, similar to the protective pillar of cloud and fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>).<p><b>and to bring you to the place I have prepared</b><br>The "place" refers to the Promised Land, Canaan, which God had promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This promise is a continuation of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. The preparation of the land signifies God's sovereignty and foreknowledge, ensuring that the land is ready for the Israelites' arrival. This also foreshadows the New Testament promise of Jesus preparing a place for believers (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>), drawing a parallel between the physical journey to Canaan and the spiritual journey to eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel.htm">Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger sent by God to guide and protect the Israelites.

This verse invites believers today to trust the same faithful Lord who still protects, leads, and brings His people safely into all He has promised.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>THE PROMISES OF GOD TO ISRAEL, IF THE COVENANT IS KEPT.</span><p>(20-33) The Book of the Covenant terminates, very appropriately, with a series of promises. God is "the rewarder of them that diligently seek him." He chooses to "reward men after their works," and to set before them "the recompense of the reward." He "knows whereof we are made," and by what motives we are influenced. Self-interest, the desire of our own good, is one of the strongest of them. If Israel will keep His covenant, they will enjoy the following blessings :--(1) The guidance and protection of His angel till Canaan is reached; (2) God's help against their adversaries, who will, little by little, be driven out; (3) the ultimate possession of the entire country between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea on the one hand, the Desert and the Euphrates on the other; (4) a blessing upon their flocks and herds, which shall neither be barren nor cast their young; and (5) a blessing upon themselves, whereby they will escape sickness and enjoy a long term of life. All these advantages, however, are conditional upon obedience, and may be forfeited.<p>(20) <span class= "bld">I send an Angel before thee.</span>--Kalisch considers Moses to have been the "angel" or "messenger;" others understand one of the created angelic host. But most commentators see in the promise the first mention of the "Angel of the Covenant," who is reasonably identified with the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, the Eternal Son and Word of God. When the promise is retracted on account of the sin of the golden calf, it is in the words, "<span class= "ital">I </span>will not go up with thee" (<a href="/exodus/33-3.htm" title="To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the middle of you; for you are a stiff necked people: lest I consume you in the way.">Exodus 33:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-31.</span> - THE REWARDS OF OBEDIENCE. God always places before men" the recompense of the reward." He does not require of them that they should serve him for nought. The "Book of the Covenant" appropriately ends with a number of promises, which God undertakes to perform, if Israel keeps the terms of the covenant. The promises are: - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That he will send an angel before them to be their guide, director, and helper (vers. 20 - 23). <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he will be the enemy of their enemies (ver. 22), striking terror into them miraculously (ver. 27), and subjecting them to other scourges also (ver. 28). <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That he will drive out their enemies "by little and little" (ver. 30), not ceasing until he has destroyed them (ver. 23).  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/23-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_595.htm">Strong's 595: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">am sending</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1444;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#333;&#183;l&#234;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an angel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4397.htm">Strong's 4397: </a> </span><span class="str2">A messenger, of God, an angel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">before you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1428;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;ne&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
