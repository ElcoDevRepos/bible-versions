The context is Jethro's advice to Moses to delegate responsibilities to capable men, which reflects an early form of organized governance. This system ensured continuous access to justice, preventing Moses from being overwhelmed. It highlights the importance of constant and fair judgment, a principle echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>, where judges are instructed to judge fairly and without partiality.<p><b>they would bring the difficult cases to Moses,</b><br>This reflects a hierarchical structure in decision-making, where complex or significant matters were escalated to Moses. It underscores Moses' role as the ultimate human authority and mediator, prefiguring Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). This system ensured that Moses could focus on matters requiring divine insight or wisdom, akin to how Christ intercedes for believers.<p><b>but any minor issue they would judge themselves.</b><br>This delegation of authority allowed for efficient governance and empowered leaders within the community. It reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and responsibility, as seen in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>). By handling minor issues, these leaders maintained order and justice, fostering a sense of community and shared responsibility.
