His role is reminiscent of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity. Moses' leadership is crucial at this moment of crisis, demonstrating the importance of faith and obedience to God's appointed leaders.<p><b>Do not be afraid.</b><br>Fear is a common human response to danger, but throughout Scripture, God frequently commands His people not to fear (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). This command is a call to trust in God's power and faithfulness, reminding believers that God is sovereign over all circumstances.<p><b>Stand firm</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the need for faith and patience. The Israelites are instructed to remain steadfast and trust in God's deliverance. This mirrors <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>, where believers are encouraged to stand firm in the face of spiritual battles, relying on God's strength.<p><b>and you will see the LORD&#8217;s salvation,</b><br>The concept of salvation is central to the biblical narrative. Here, it refers to physical deliverance from the Egyptians, but it also foreshadows the spiritual salvation offered through Jesus Christ. The LORD's salvation is a demonstration of His power and grace, fulfilling His promises to His people.<p><b>which He will accomplish for you today;</b><br>This assurance highlights God's active role in delivering His people. It underscores the immediacy and certainty of God's intervention. The phrase "for you" emphasizes God's personal care and commitment to His covenant people.<p><b>for the Egyptians you see today,</b><br>The Egyptians represent the oppressive forces from which God is delivering the Israelites. Historically, Egypt was a powerful nation, and its army was formidable. This context underscores the miraculous nature of the impending deliverance.<p><b>you will never see again.</b><br>This promise signifies a complete and final deliverance from their oppressors. It is a prophetic declaration of God's victory over the enemies of His people. This mirrors the ultimate victory over sin and death achieved through Christ's resurrection, where believers are assured that their spiritual enemies will be defeated once and for all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egyptian bondage.

So long as we have means of resistance put in our power, with a reasonable prospect of success, it is our duty to use them--to exert ourselves to the uttermost, to make all possible efforts. God, for the most part, "helps those who help themselves." But there are occasions when we can do nothing--when all must be left to Him. (Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/20-17.htm" title="You shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand you still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.">2Chronicles 20:17</a>.) Under these circumstances, our duty and our true wisdom is to wait patiently, quietly, courageously.

Moses knew that the pursuit of Israel by the host of the Egyptians was a part of the counsel of God, and was to tend in some way or other to the promotion of God's honour and glory (ver. 4). He had sufficient faith to believe in a deliverance the nature of which it is not likely that he could anyway conjecture. Whether hail would fall from heaven and destroy them (<a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>); or the earth gape and swallow them up (<a href="/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a>); or the angel of death smite them all in the night (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>); or any other strange form of destruction come upon them, he did not know; but he concluded from what had been revealed to him, that God was about to vindicate his own honour without the aid of man. Hence his words - <span class="cmt_word">Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord</span> - which assigned to the Israelites a mere passive attitude of expectation. <span class="cmt_word">For the Egyptians</span>, etc. The order of the words in the original favours the marginal rendering, which is to be adopted with one slight change.
