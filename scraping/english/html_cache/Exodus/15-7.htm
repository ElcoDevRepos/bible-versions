In the context of <a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>, this refers to the Egyptians who pursued the Israelites after their escape from slavery. The overthrow of adversaries is a recurring theme in the Bible, demonstrating God's protection and deliverance of His people. This can be seen in other instances such as the defeat of the Canaanites (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>) and the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10</a>). The term "adversaries" can also be understood spiritually, representing the forces of evil that oppose God's purposes.<p><b>by Your great majesty</b><br>The majesty of God refers to His supreme authority and glory. In the context of the Exodus, God's majesty was displayed through the miraculous parting of the Red Sea and the subsequent destruction of the Egyptian army. This event is a testament to God's unparalleled power and serves as a reminder of His ability to accomplish His will. The majesty of God is a central theme throughout Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/93.htm">Psalm 93:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>, where God's glory and authority are exalted.<p><b>You unleashed Your burning wrath</b><br>The concept of God's wrath is often associated with His justice and holiness. In the Exodus narrative, God's wrath was directed against the Egyptians for their oppression of the Israelites and their defiance of His commands. The "burning" aspect of God's wrath emphasizes its intensity and consuming nature. This is consistent with other biblical accounts where God's wrath is depicted as a consuming fire (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). It serves as a warning of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God.<p><b>it consumed them like stubble</b><br>The imagery of stubble being consumed by fire illustrates the complete and swift destruction of the Egyptians. Stubble, being dry and brittle, burns quickly and thoroughly, symbolizing the ease with which God can execute judgment. This metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe the fate of the wicked (<a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>, <a href="/malachi/4.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>). It underscores the futility of opposing God and the certainty of His judgment against those who resist His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

The word &#8220;overthrew&#8221; pictures a violent hurling down&#8212;God personally toppled the strongest military force on earth.<p>&#8226; This is not a metaphor; it is the actual collapse of chariots and horsemen, proving God&#8217;s promises in <a href="/exodus/6-1.htm">Exodus 6:1</a> and confirming later truths such as <a href="/deuteronomy/33-27.htm">Deuteronomy 33:27</a> (&#8220;He drives out the enemy before you&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Every &#8220;adversary&#8221; of God&#8217;s people is ultimately God&#8217;s adversary; <a href="/psalms/92-9.htm">Psalm 92:9</a> echoes, &#8220;Your enemies, LORD&#8230; will perish.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The victory gives Israel confidence for future battles (<a href="/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10</a> recalls this Red Sea defeat).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by Your great majesty</b><p>The method of victory is God&#8217;s sheer grandeur.
