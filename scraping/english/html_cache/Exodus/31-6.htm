His selection highlights the importance of divine appointment in the work of God. The tribe of Dan, to which Oholiab belongs, is one of the twelve tribes of Israel, often associated with craftsmanship and artistry. This choice underscores the inclusivity of God's work, as Dan is not one of the leading tribes like Judah or Levi. The name Oholiab means "Father's tent," which is fitting given his role in constructing the Tabernacle, the dwelling place of God among His people. This appointment also reflects the biblical principle that God equips those He calls, providing them with the necessary skills and abilities to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>I have also given skill to all the craftsmen,</b><br>God's provision of skill to the craftsmen emphasizes His sovereignty and involvement in the details of the Tabernacle's construction. This divine endowment of skill is a reminder that all talents and abilities are gifts from God, meant to be used for His glory. The craftsmen's skills are not merely natural talents but are enhanced by God's Spirit, indicating that spiritual empowerment is essential for accomplishing God's work. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where spiritual gifts are given to believers for the edification of the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>).<p><b>that they may fashion all that I have commanded you:</b><br>The purpose of the skills given to the craftsmen is to execute God's specific instructions for the Tabernacle. This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands and the precision required in following His plans. The detailed instructions for the Tabernacle, found in earlier chapters of Exodus, reflect the holiness and order of God. The Tabernacle itself is a type of Christ, symbolizing God's presence among His people and foreshadowing the incarnation of Jesus, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).

Earlier, the LORD singled out Bezalel from Judah (<a href="/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2-3</a>), yet here He reaches into Dan to supply a complementary helper.<p>- This pairing models the way the body of Christ functions with varied members, as Paul later highlights in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18-21</a>.<p>- Oholiab&#8217;s appointment affirms that ministry involves teamwork; even Moses needed Aaron (<a href="/exodus/4-14.htm">Exodus 4:14-16</a>), and Bezalel needed Oholiab.<p>- Scripture later repeats Oholiab&#8217;s name to emphasize God&#8217;s endorsement (<a href="/exodus/35-34.htm">Exodus 35:34</a>), reminding us that every servant known by heaven is significant, even if less famous on earth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have also given skill to all the craftsmen</b><p>The LORD is the source of every ability. He does not merely command excellence; He supplies it.<p>- Bezalel, Oholiab, and &#8220;all the craftsmen&#8221; receive their artistry from God, paralleling how the Spirit later empowered Hiram of Tyre for Solomon&#8217;s temple work (<a href="/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13-14</a>).<p>- This gifting extends beyond leaders to &#8220;all,&#8221; echoing <a href="/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6-8</a>, where every believer receives grace-gifts for service.<p>- Because the talent is God-given, the work cannot be divorced from worship; skill becomes an act of praise (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That they may fashion all that I have commanded you</b><p>The end goal is obedience.

Their creativity operates within clear revelation, much like Noah building the ark &#8220;according to all that God had commanded him&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>).<p>- The phrase ties skill to stewardship; talents are entrusted for specific kingdom purposes, a truth Jesus later teaches through the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<p>- Successful completion ensures the tabernacle becomes the meeting place where God dwells among His people (<a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45-46</a>), pointing ahead to Christ, &#8220;the Word who became flesh and tabernacled among us&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/31-6.htm">Exodus 31:6</a> reveals a God who calls people by name, equips them with Spirit-breathed abilities, and directs those abilities toward obedient service. Oholiab&#8217;s selection shows that every tribe and person matters; the shared gifting of all craftsmen highlights God as the fountain of skill; and the purpose clause roots every talent in fulfilling divine command. When we recognize our abilities as gifts to advance God&#8217;s revealed will, we walk in the same pattern set at the foot of Sinai.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach.</span>--It has been observed above (see the first Note on the chapter) that Bezaleel's work was general, Aholiab's, special.

In the original, however, nothing is said of engraving, and the true meaning seems to be that Aholiab had the charge of the textile fabrics needed for the sanctuary, and directed both the weaving and the embroidery, but did not intermeddle in other matters. (See Note on <a href="/exodus/38-23.htm" title="And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.">Exodus 38:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Of the tribe of Dan.</span>--The tribe of Dan is among the most undistinguished; but it produced two great artists--Aholiab, the skilful maker of the textile fabrics of the tabernacle, and Hiram, the master workman employed in the ornamentation of Solomon's temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-14.htm" title="The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of engraving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with your cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David your father.">2Chronicles 2:14</a>).<p><span class= "bld">All that are wise hearted.</span>--On the expression "wise hearted," see Note 1 on <a href="/exodus/28-3.htm" title="And you shall speak to all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister to me in the priest's office.">Exodus 28:3</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Aholiab</span> appears to have had the entire charge of the textile fabrics, both woven and embroidered (<a href="/exodus/38-23.htm">Exodus 38:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the tribe of Ban</span>.
