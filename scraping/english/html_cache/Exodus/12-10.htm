The urgency of the command reflects the immediacy of their departure. In a broader biblical context, this instruction emphasizes the importance of obedience and trust in God's timing. The prohibition against leaving any of the lamb until morning signifies the completeness of the sacrifice, which is a type of Christ, the Lamb of God, whose sacrifice is complete and sufficient for salvation (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The command also underscores the need for readiness and faith, as the Israelites were to be prepared to leave at a moment's notice.<p><b>before the morning you must burn up any part that is left over.</b><br>The requirement to burn any leftovers ensures that the sacrifice remains holy and is not profaned by decay or misuse. This practice of burning remains is consistent with other sacrificial laws found in Leviticus, where offerings not consumed by the priests were to be burned (<a href="/leviticus/7-17.htm">Leviticus 7:17</a>). The act of burning signifies purification and the complete dedication of the offering to God. In a typological sense, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's complete and unblemished sacrifice, which leaves nothing lacking in the atonement for sin. The burning of leftovers also symbolizes the finality and totality of God's deliverance, as the Israelites were to leave nothing behind in Egypt, just as believers are called to leave their old lives behind in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

Israel was to consume the lamb entirely the same night, just as they had been told to apply its blood the same evening (<a href="/exodus/12-7.htm">Exodus 12:7</a>). Partial obedience would have betrayed distrust. <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> reminds us to be &#8220;doers of the word,&#8221; not half-hearted responders.<p>&#8226; Urgency and readiness. The people were to eat &#8220;with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>). They needed to be poised for God&#8217;s immediate deliverance. In <a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35</a> Jesus urges, &#8220;Be dressed for service and keep your lamps burning.&#8221; Both scenes call God&#8217;s people to live in expectant preparation.<p>&#8226; Trust in daily provision. Leaving nothing for morning forced the Israelites to rely on God for the next day&#8217;s food, much like the daily gathering of manna in <a href="/exodus/16-19.htm">Exodus 16:19-20</a>. <a href="/matthew/6-34.htm">Matthew 6:34</a> echoes the same faith principle: &#8220;Do not worry about tomorrow.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>before the morning you must burn up any part that is left over</b><p>The second half commands, &#8220;before the morning you must burn up any part that is left over.&#8221; This directive highlights:<p>&#8226; Purity of worship. Anything not eaten was not to decay or become common; it had been set apart for a sacred purpose. Similar language appears in <a href="/exodus/29-34.htm">Exodus 29:34</a> and <a href="/leviticus/7-17.htm">Leviticus 7:17</a>, where leftover sacrificial meat is burned to avoid defilement.<p>&#8226; Finality of redemption. Once the blood had shielded the households and the meat had been eaten, nothing more was needed. <a href="/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a> affirms, &#8220;For by one sacrifice He has made perfect forever those who are being sanctified.&#8221; Burning the remainder portrayed a finished, sufficient act.<p>&#8226; Foreshadowing of Christ. The Passover lamb pointed to Jesus, &#8220;the Lamb of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). Just as no part of the lamb was left to corruption, so God &#8220;will not let Your Holy One see decay&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>; <a href="/acts/2-27.htm">Acts 2:27</a>). The completeness of the lamb&#8217;s consumption anticipates the completeness of Christ&#8217;s atoning work.<p>&#8226; Separation from Egypt. Destroying leftovers eliminated any temptation to carry the lamb&#8217;s meat on the journey as ordinary rations. In like manner, <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a> calls believers to &#8220;come out from among them and be separate.&#8221; The meal was a one-night, God-ordained statement of breakaway deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/12-10.htm">Exodus 12:10</a> commands Israel neither to save nor discard casually the Passover lamb. Consuming it fully that night and burning what remained taught them complete, prompt obedience, reliance on God&#8217;s daily care, worship free from corruption, and a clean break from their old life in Egypt. The verse ultimately points us to the perfect, once-for-all sacrifice of Christ, whose redeeming work leaves nothing unfinished and calls believers to live in ready, wholehearted devotion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Ye shall let nothing of it remain.</span>--That there might be neither profanation nor superstitious use of what was left.
