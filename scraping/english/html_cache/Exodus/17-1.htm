The term "congregation" emphasizes their unity as a people chosen by God. This collective movement underscores the communal nature of their journey and their shared experiences and challenges.<p><b>left the Desert of Sin</b><br>The Desert of Sin is a geographical area located between Elim and Mount Sinai. The name "Sin" is not related to the English word for wrongdoing but is likely derived from a Semitic root. This desert was part of the Israelites' wilderness journey, a period marked by testing and reliance on God's provision. The departure from this location signifies a transition in their journey towards the Promised Land.<p><b>moving from place to place as the LORD commanded</b><br>This indicates that the Israelites' journey was not random but directed by divine guidance. The LORD's command was often communicated through the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night, symbolizing God's presence and leadership. This obedience to divine direction is a recurring theme in their wilderness wanderings, highlighting the importance of following God's guidance.<p><b>They camped at Rephidim</b><br>Rephidim is a significant stop in the Israelites' journey, located in the Sinai Peninsula. It is here that they faced a lack of water, leading to a crisis of faith and reliance on God. Rephidim is also the site of the battle with the Amalekites, where Moses' raised hands, supported by Aaron and Hur, led to Israel's victory, symbolizing the power of intercession and divine support.<p><b>but there was no water for the people to drink</b><br>The lack of water at Rephidim presents a test of faith for the Israelites, who had previously experienced God's miraculous provision of water at Marah and Elim. This situation foreshadows the recurring theme of grumbling and testing God, which is addressed in the New Testament as a warning against unbelief. The absence of water also sets the stage for God's miraculous provision through Moses striking the rock, a type of Christ as the spiritual Rock providing living water.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_sin.htm">The Wilderness of Sin</a></b><br>A desert region the Israelites traveled through after leaving Egypt.

From El Markha there are three modes of reaching the Wady Feiran, where Rephidim is placed by most critics. One route (the shortest) is from the northern part of El Markha by Wady Shellal and Wady Magharah, where there was an important Egyptian settlement. This the Israelites would probably have avoided. Another, from the central part of El Markha, leads through the Wady Seih Sidreh to Magharah, and would, therefore, have been equally inconvenient. The third is circuitous, but has the advantage of being very open, and therefore suitable for a vast host. It passes through the whole of El Markha, and then, skirting the mountain, enters Wady Feiran at its south-western extremity. The probability seems on the whole to be that the Israelites pursued this last route.<p><span class= "bld">After their journeys.</span>--We find from <a href="/context/numbers/33-12.htm" title="And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.">Numbers 33:12-13</a>, that Rephidim was reached from the wilderness of Sin by three journeys--from Sin to Dophkah, from Dophkah to Alush, and from Alusb to Rephidim. The distance by the route which we have supposed the Israelites to have taken is about fifty miles.<p><span class= "bld">Rephidim </span>means <span class= "ital">rests, </span>or <span class= "ital">resting-places, </span>and is an appropriate name for the central part of the Wady Feiran--the most fertile spot in the whole peninsula, where there is usually abundant water, rich vegetation, and numerous palm-trees. (Lepsius, <span class= "ital">Tour from Thebes to Sinai, </span>pp. 21, 37; Stanley, <span class= "ital">Sinai and Palestine, </span>pp. 40, 41.) According to Dean Stanley, "the oldest known tradition of the peninsula" identifies Rephidim with Paran--the seat of an early bishopric--undoubtedly the same word with Feiran.<p><span class= "bld">There was no water.</span>--Though Feiran is usually watered by a copious stream, there have been occasions when the brook has been dried up. Graul found it dry in March, 1858. (Stanley, p. 40, Note 3.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - THE SECOND MUMURING FOR WATER. When the Israelites had come to Rephidim which was probably in the Wady Feiran, near its junction with the Wady Esh-Sheikh, complaint arose, not, as at Marah (<a href="/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23</a>), that there was no drinkable water, but that there was no water at all. Water had been expected, and consequently no supply had been brought; but none was found. Violent murmurs arose, and the people were ready to stone their leader (ver. 4), who had, they considered, brought them into the difficulty. As usual, Moses took his grief to God, and laid it before him, with the result that God gave miraculous relief. Moses was bidden to take his rod, and go with the elders to a particular rock known as "the rock in Horeb" (ver. 6), and there strike the rock, and water would flow forth. This he did, and a copious stream welled out, which furnished abundant drink to the whole multitude. In remembrance of the murmuring, he called the place Massah (trial) and Meribah (quarrel). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From the wilderness of Sin</span>. See the comment on Exodus 16:1. The sandy coast tract (El Murka) was probably quitted in lat. 28&deg; 42' nearly, and the Wady Feiran entered on at its south-western extremity. Two stations, Dophkah and Alush, lay between the Sin wilderness and Rephidim, as we learn from <a href="/numbers/33-12.htm">Numbers 33:12, 13</a>. It is impossible to locate these places with exactness. <span class="cmt_word">After their journeys</span>.
