This partnership highlights the importance of community and support in fulfilling God's mission. Aaron's role as a communicator is significant, as he becomes the first high priest, foreshadowing Christ as our ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The phrase underscores the importance of obedience and faithfulness in delivering God's message accurately. This moment is pivotal as it marks the beginning of the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>).<p><b>And Moses performed the signs before the people,</b><br>Moses performs miraculous signs to authenticate his divine commission, including turning a staff into a serpent, making his hand leprous, and turning water from the Nile into blood (<a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2-9</a>). These signs serve as a testament to God's power and presence, reassuring the Israelites of His commitment to their deliverance. The signs prefigure the miracles of Jesus, who also performed signs to validate His divine authority (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>).
