The speaker is Moses, acting as a prophet and leader, conveying God's direct instructions. The title "the God of Israel" emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and the Israelites, reminding them of their unique identity and obligations. This context is crucial as it follows the incident of the golden calf, where the Israelites broke their covenant by idolatry.<p><b>&#8216;Each of you men is to fasten his sword to his side,</b><br>The command to arm themselves signifies preparation for a serious and solemn task. The sword is a symbol of judgment and authority, often used in Scripture to denote divine retribution (e.g., <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>). This act of fastening the sword indicates readiness to execute God's judgment, highlighting the gravity of the situation.<p><b>go back and forth through the camp from gate to gate,</b><br>The instruction to move throughout the camp suggests a thorough and comprehensive action, ensuring that the judgment is carried out without partiality. The mention of "gate to gate" implies a systematic approach, covering the entire community. This reflects the seriousness of the sin and the need for a complete purging of idolatry from among the people.<p><b>and slay his brother, his friend, and his neighbor.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the severity of the command, as it involves executing those close to them. It highlights the cost of sin and the necessity of prioritizing obedience to God over personal relationships. This mirrors Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a> about the cost of discipleship. The drastic measure serves as a deterrent against future idolatry and underscores the holiness required by God.
