Despite their sin, God reaffirms His promise to lead them to the Promised Land, showing His faithfulness and mercy. The "place I described" refers to Canaan, a land promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This directive underscores the leadership role of Moses as God's chosen mediator and guide for the Israelites.<p><b>Behold, My angel shall go before you.</b><br>The mention of "My angel" indicates divine guidance and protection. This angel is often interpreted as a theophany, a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ, who leads and protects God's people (<a href="/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20-23</a>). The angel's presence reassures the Israelites of God's continued commitment to His covenant, despite their rebellion. This divine guidance is a recurring theme, as seen in the pillar of cloud and fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>).<p><b>But on the day I settle accounts,</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of divine justice and accountability. It implies that while God is merciful, He is also just and will hold people accountable for their actions. The "day I settle accounts" can be seen as a foreshadowing of future judgment, both immediate and eschatological. This reflects the biblical principle that sin has consequences, as seen in the eventual punishment of the Israelites who rebelled (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>).<p><b>I will punish them for their sin.&#8221;</b><br>God's promise to punish sin highlights His holiness and the seriousness of idolatry. The immediate context refers to the punishment of those who participated in the golden calf incident, which included a plague (<a href="/exodus/32-35.htm">Exodus 32:35</a>). This serves as a warning to the Israelites and a reminder of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). Theologically, it points to the need for atonement and the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who bore the punishment for sin on behalf of humanity (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them to the Promised Land.
