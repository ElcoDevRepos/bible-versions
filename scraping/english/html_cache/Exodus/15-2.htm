In the context of <a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>, this is part of the Song of Moses, sung after the Israelites' miraculous escape from Egypt through the Red Sea. The term "strength" signifies God's power and might, which delivered them from their enemies. "Song" indicates a response of worship and gratitude. This duality of strength and song is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/118-14.htm">Psalm 118:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>, where God is similarly praised for His deliverance and protection.<p><b>and He has become my salvation</b><br>This phrase reflects the transformation of God's deliverance into personal salvation. In the historical context, the Israelites experienced physical salvation from slavery and imminent death. Theologically, this prefigures the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from sin and death. The concept of God as salvation is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/43-11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>, where God is recognized as the sole source of salvation.<p><b>He is my God, and I will praise Him</b><br>Here, the declaration "He is my God" signifies a personal acknowledgment and acceptance of God's sovereignty and authority. This personal claim is significant in the cultural context of the ancient Near East, where multiple deities were worshiped. The commitment to praise God is an act of worship and devotion, reflecting a heart of gratitude and reverence. This sentiment is echoed in <a href="/psalms/63.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>, where the psalmist expresses a deep longing and commitment to worship God.<p><b>my father&#8217;s God, and I will exalt Him</b><br>This phrase connects the present generation with the faith of their ancestors, acknowledging the continuity of God's covenantal relationship with His people. "My father&#8217;s God" refers to the God of the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promises across generations. The act of exalting God is a response to His faithfulness and mighty acts, as seen in other biblical passages like <a href="/psalms/145.htm">Psalm 145:1</a>, where exalting God is a central theme of worship. This connection to the patriarchs also underscores the importance of heritage and tradition in the faith journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal presence and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_the_israelites.htm">Moses and the Israelites</a></b><br>The people who sang this song of praise after their deliverance from Egypt and the crossing of the Red Sea.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea_crossing.htm">The Red Sea Crossing</a></b><br>A miraculous event where God parted the sea, allowing the Israelites to escape from the pursuing Egyptian army.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The oppressors of the Israelites, representing bondage and sin from which God delivers His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_song_of_moses.htm">The Song of Moses</a></b><br>A song of victory and praise, celebrating God's deliverance and power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_strength_and_song.htm">God as Strength and Song</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the source of our strength in times of trouble and our joy in times of victory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/salvation_as_a_personal_experience.htm">Salvation as a Personal Experience</a></b><br>Understand that salvation is not just a historical event but a personal reality for each believer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/praise_as_a_response_to_deliverance.htm">Praise as a Response to Deliverance</a></b><br>Cultivate a heart of worship and gratitude, acknowledging God's work in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_faithfulness.htm">Generational Faithfulness</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of passing down the knowledge and worship of God to future generations, as Moses refers to "my father&#8217;s God."<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/exalting_god_in_all_circumstances.htm">Exalting God in All Circumstances</a></b><br>Commit to exalting God not only in times of triumph but also in everyday life, recognizing His sovereignty and goodness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_15_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 15:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_The_LORD_is_my_strength.htm">How can "The LORD is my strength" influence your daily challenges and decisions?

It is here used on account of the rhythm.<p><span class= "bld">He is become my salvation.</span>--Heb,, <span class= "ital">he has been to me for salvation: i.e., </span>"he has saved me out of the hand of Pharaoh." The beauty and force of the passage causes Isaiah to adopt it into one of his most glorious poems, the "joyful thanksgiving of the faithful for the mercies of God," contained in his twelfth chapter. (See <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm" title="The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.">Exodus 15:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I will prepare him an habitation.</span>--So Onkelos and Aben-Ezra; but Jarchi, the Targums of Jerusalem and Jonathan, the LXX., and Vulg., with most moderns, translate, "I will glorify him." It is a strong objection to the rendering of the Authorised Version that Moses is not likely to have had the idea of preparing God a habitation until the revelation of God's will on the subject was made to him on Sinai (Exodus 25-27). The law of parallelism also requires such a meaning as "glorify" to correspond with the "exalt" of the next clause.<p><span class= "bld">My father's God.</span>--"Father" here, by a common Hebrew idiom, stands for "forefathers" generally. (Comp. Note on <a href="/exodus/3-6.htm" title="Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look on God.">Exodus 3:6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is my strength and song</span>. Literally, "My strength and song is Jah." The name <span class="accented">Jah</span> had not previously been used. It is commonly regarded as an abbreviated form of Jehovah, and was the form generally used in the termination of names, as Abijah, Ahaziah, Hezekiah, Zedekiah, Mount Moriah, etc. It takes the place of "Jehovah" here, probably on account of the rhythm. <span class="cmt_word">He is become my salvation</span>. Literally, "He has been to me for salvation," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "He has delivered me out of the hand of Pharaoh and his host, and so saved me from destruction." <span class="cmt_word">I will prepare him a habitation</span>. This translation seems to have come originally from the Targum of Onkelos, who paraphrases the single word of the text by the phrase "I will build him a sanctuary." The meaning is a possible one: but most modern commentators prefer to connect the verb used with a root meaning "beautiful," and translate "I will glorify him." (So Gesenius. Rosenmuller, Knobel, Kalisch, Cook. The LXX have <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">glorificabo</span>.
