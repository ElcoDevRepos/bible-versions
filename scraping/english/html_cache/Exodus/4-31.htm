Their belief is a pivotal moment, as it marks the beginning of their journey from slavery to freedom. This faith is reminiscent of Abraham's belief in God, which was counted to him as righteousness (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>). It also foreshadows the necessity of faith in the New Testament, where belief in Jesus Christ is central to salvation (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>And when they heard that the LORD had attended to the Israelites</b><br>The phrase highlights God's active involvement and concern for His people. This divine attention is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to be with their descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>). It also reflects God's covenant faithfulness, as He remembers His covenant and acts on behalf of the Israelites. This divine attention is echoed in the New Testament, where God is portrayed as a caring Father who knows the needs of His children (<a href="/matthew/6-8.htm">Matthew 6:8</a>).<p><b>and had seen their affliction,</b><br>God's awareness of the Israelites' suffering in Egypt underscores His compassion and justice. This mirrors God's earlier statement to Moses at the burning bush, where He declares that He has seen the misery of His people (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). The theme of God seeing and responding to human suffering is prevalent throughout Scripture, culminating in the person of Jesus Christ, who is moved with compassion for the afflicted (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>).<p><b>they bowed down and worshiped.</b><br>The response of the Israelites is one of reverence and submission to God. Bowing down is a physical act of worship, indicating humility and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. This act of worship is a precursor to the worship practices that will be established in the Mosaic Law. It also points forward to the worship of God in spirit and truth, as emphasized by Jesus in <a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>.

Abram &#8220;believed the LORD&#8221; in <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>; the Israelites &#8220;believed in the LORD and in His servant Moses&#8221; after the Red Sea in <a href="/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a>.<p>&#8226; In every age, belief is the doorway to deliverance. <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> reminds us that &#8220;without faith it is impossible to please God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their belief rested on God&#8217;s revealed word through Moses, showing that genuine faith is never blind; it is a reasoned response to God&#8217;s promises (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When they heard that the LORD had attended to the Israelites</b><p>Hearing that the Lord had &#8220;attended&#8221; (visited, regarded) His people stirred fresh hope.<p>&#8226; Earlier, God said, &#8220;I have surely visited you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>). That same language of divine visitation appears when Zechariah rejoices, &#8220;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine attendance means covenant faithfulness: He &#8220;remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, Christ&#8217;s promise, &#8220;I am with you always&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>), is the ultimate evidence that God still attends to His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Had seen their affliction</b><p>God&#8217;s awareness is personal and compassionate. He told Moses, &#8220;I have surely seen the affliction of My people&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a> affirms, &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous and His ears are inclined to their cry.&#8221;<p>&#8226; When oppressed Israel realized that God truly saw their misery, despair turned to worship.<p>&#8226; The same assurance sustains believers facing trials: &#8220;We do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They bowed down and worshiped</b><p>Faith that hears and knows God&#8217;s care culminates in adoration.<p>&#8226; Bowing is the natural posture before majesty; Moses would later hurry to bow when God&#8217;s glory passed by (<a href="/exodus/34-8.htm">Exodus 34:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Worship acknowledges God&#8217;s character and works&#8212;something Israel repeats after Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-27.htm">Exodus 12:27</a>) and that heaven mirrors as elders &#8220;fall down before Him&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/4-10.htm">Revelation 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; True worship is both inward reverence and outward expression, the rightful response whenever God unveils His saving hand (<a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a> shows a beautiful progression: faith sparked by God&#8217;s word, hope ignited by His visitation, comfort born of His compassionate sight, and heartfelt worship as the fitting response. The verse assures believers that the Lord still speaks, attends, sees, and therefore deserves our humble adoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people believed</span>. This ready faith stands in strong contrast with the ordinary incredulous temper of the Israelitish people, who were "a faithless and stubborn generation" - a generation that "believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation" (<a href="/psalms/78-22.htm">Psalm 78:22</a>). It would seem that under the pressure of affliction - having, humanly speaking, no hope - the stubborn spirit of the people had given way, and they were content to look to Jehovah and accept his promises, and believe in his messengers, notwithstanding their natural scepticism. No doubt the novelty of miracles helped to produce this state of feeling; and the fact that they were not called upon at present for any active exertion made acquiescence in what Moses put before them easier. <span class="cmt_word">When they heard that the Lord had visited</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when the message contained in <a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a> was delivered to them. And that he had looked upon their affliction. Compare <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>. They bowed their heads. Rather "they bowed down" (Kalisch), or "inclined themselves." And worshipped. Some understand an act of respect and ho-mage done to Moses and Aaron, in token of their acceptance by the people as leaders; but, though the words employed are sometimes used in this sense, the context is opposed to their having this sense in this place. "When the people heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel they bowed down and worshipped." Whom? Surely, the Lord. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/4-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and [they]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
