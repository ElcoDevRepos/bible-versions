In the context of <a href="/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19</a>, the increasing volume of the shofar signifies the intensifying presence of God on Mount Sinai. This auditory cue would have been a powerful reminder to the Israelites of God's holiness and the seriousness of the covenant being established. The shofar is also used in other biblical contexts, such as the fall of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>) and the Year of Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>), symbolizing liberation and divine action.<p><b>Moses spoke</b><br>Moses, as the mediator between God and the Israelites, plays a crucial role in this narrative. His speaking indicates his unique position to communicate directly with God, a role that prefigures Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). Moses' leadership and prophetic role are central to the unfolding of God's plan for Israel, and his communication with God here underscores the direct relationship and responsibility he bears.<p><b>and God answered him in the thunder</b><br>The thunder represents God's powerful and awe-inspiring presence. In the ancient Near Eastern context, thunder was often associated with divine activity and authority. God's response in thunder emphasizes His majesty and the seriousness of the covenant being established. This theophany, or visible manifestation of God, is a reminder of His sovereignty and the reverence due to Him. The thunderous response also connects to other biblical instances where God's voice is described as thunderous, such as in <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-9</a>, highlighting His power and glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to mediate the covenant at Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Almighty, who reveals Himself to the Israelites at Mount Sinai, demonstrating His power and holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God gives the Law to Moses and the Israelites, a place of divine revelation and covenant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_trumpet_sound.htm">The Trumpet Sound</a></b><br>A supernatural sound that signifies God's presence and the seriousness of the moment, growing louder as God prepares to speak.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thunder.htm">The Thunder</a></b><br>Represents God's voice, emphasizing His majesty and the awe-inspiring nature of His communication with Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god.htm">The Holiness of God</a></b><br>The increasing sound of the trumpet and the thunderous voice remind us of God's holiness and the reverence due to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_communication.htm">God's Communication</a></b><br>God speaks to His people, and His voice is powerful and authoritative.

This is a somewhat free translation; but it gives well the real meaning of the Hebrew. We may conclude that the trumpet's blast was not continuous. It sounded when the manifestation began (ver. 16). It sounded again, much louder and with a much more prolonged note, to herald the actual descent of God upon the mount. This time the sound was so piercing, so terrible, so intolerable, that Moses could no longer endure to keep silence, but burst out in speech. Were his words those recorded in <a href="/hebrews/12-21.htm">Hebrews 12:21</a> - "I exceedingly fear and quake" - words not found now in the Old Testament - or were they others which have been wholly lost to us? It is impossible to say. His speech, however, had the effect of bringing the awful preparations to a close - "Moses spake, and God. answered him by a voice, and the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/19-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
