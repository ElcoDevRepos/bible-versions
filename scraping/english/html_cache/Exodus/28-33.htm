In the context of the priestly garments, it symbolizes fruitfulness and blessing. The colors blue, purple, and scarlet are significant in the tabernacle and priestly attire, representing divinity, royalty, and sacrifice, respectively. Blue is often associated with the heavens and the divine, purple with royalty and wealth, and scarlet with blood and sacrifice. These colors are also used in the construction of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/26.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>) and are symbolic of the majesty and holiness of God. The use of these colors in the priestly garments signifies the high calling and sacred duty of the priesthood.<p><b>all the way around the lower hem</b><br>The placement of the pomegranates around the hem of the robe indicates completeness and continuity. The hem of a garment in ancient times often symbolized authority and identity. By encircling the hem with pomegranates, the garment is marked as belonging to the high priest, who serves as a mediator between God and the people. This design also ensures that the priest is constantly reminded of his role and the divine presence as he moves.<p><b>with gold bells between them</b><br>The gold bells serve a practical and symbolic purpose. Practically, they produce sound as the high priest moves, signifying his presence and activity within the holy place. Symbolically, gold represents purity and divinity. The sound of the bells is a reminder of the priest's sacred duties and the need for reverence in the presence of God. The bells also serve as a warning, as their sound indicates the priest's movements, ensuring that he is not approached unannounced, which could lead to death (<a href="/exodus/28-35.htm">Exodus 28:35</a>). This reflects the holiness of God and the seriousness of approaching Him. The combination of pomegranates and bells illustrates the balance of fruitfulness and reverence in the priestly ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the priestly garments from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, appointed as the first high priest of Israel, for whom these garments were specifically designed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where Aaron and his descendants would serve as priests.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pomegranates_and_bells.htm">Pomegranates and Bells</a></b><br>Decorative elements on the hem of the high priest's robe, symbolizing fruitfulness and the sound of holiness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God gave Moses the law and instructions for the tabernacle and priestly garments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_colors_and_materials.htm">Symbolism of Colors and Materials</a></b><br>The blue, purple, and scarlet yarns represent royalty, divinity, and sacrifice.

Israel&#8217;s spies carried the fruit back from Canaan as proof of the land&#8217;s abundance (<a href="/numbers/13-23.htm">Numbers 13:23</a>).<p>&#8226; God uses tangible symbols to teach spiritual truth. Just as the pomegranate is packed with seeds, the priest who represents the people is to be marked by overflowing life and obedience (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Temple architecture later echoed this pattern, with pomegranates adorning the tops of the pillars (<a href="/1_kings/7-18.htm">1 Kings 7:18-20</a>), showing the continuity of God&#8217;s design.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn</b><p>&#8226; These three colors reappear throughout the tabernacle&#8212;on curtains (<a href="/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>) and the veil before the Most Holy Place (<a href="/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>).<p>&#8211; Blue points upward, reminding of the heavens and divine revelation (<a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-39</a>).<p>&#8211; Purple speaks of royalty and kingship (<a href="/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>; <a href="/john/19-2.htm">John 19:2-3</a>, where soldiers mock Jesus with a purple robe).<p>&#8211; Scarlet evokes sacrifice and atonement (<a href="/leviticus/14-52.htm">Leviticus 14:52</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19-22</a>).<p>&#8226; By combining all three threads, God visually wove together heaven, royalty, and redemption in the person and work of the high priest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the way around the lower hem</b><p>&#8226; The hem is the garment&#8217;s outermost edge&#8212;the part that moves with every step.

It appears from <a href="/joshua/7-21.htm" title="When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the middle of my tent, and the silver under it.">Joshua 7:21</a> that the fabrics of Babylon were carried by the merchants into Syria at a date not much later than this, whence we may conclude that they circulated also in Arabia and Egypt.<p><span class= "bld">Bells of gold.</span>--The bell is also more Assyrian than Egyptian. Its use as an article of priestly costume has no direct parallel, nor are bells known to have been employed in the religious services of any ancient nation. The statement that Persian kings wore bells rests upon no sufficient authority. We seem to have here the introduction of an entirely new religious usage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon the hem of it</span>.
