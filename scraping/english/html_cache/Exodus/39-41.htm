The sanctuary, or tabernacle, was the dwelling place of God among His people, and the garments symbolized purity and holiness required for service. The weaving process itself was a skilled art, indicating the value placed on these garments. The sanctuary was a portable structure, central to Israelite worship during their wilderness journey, and later replaced by the Temple in Jerusalem.<p><b>both the holy garments for Aaron the priest</b><br>Aaron, as the first high priest, wore garments that set him apart for his sacred duties. These garments included the ephod, breastplate, robe, tunic, turban, and sash, each with specific symbolic meanings. The high priest's attire was designed to reflect the glory and beauty of God, as well as to bear the names of the tribes of Israel before the Lord. The holiness of these garments underscored the need for the high priest to be consecrated and pure when entering God's presence.<p><b>and the garments for his sons to serve as priests</b><br>Aaron's sons, who served as priests, wore simpler garments compared to the high priest, yet they were still significant. These included tunics, sashes, and headbands, which were also made with fine craftsmanship. The role of the priests was to assist in the sacrificial system, maintain the sanctuary, and teach the law.
