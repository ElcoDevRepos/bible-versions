The context is the renewal of the covenant after the incident of the golden calf. Moses acts as a mediator between God and the people, a role that prefigures Christ as the ultimate mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The act of speaking signifies the transmission of divine law and guidance, emphasizing the importance of God's word in leading His people.<p><b>he put a veil over his face</b><br>The veil signifies the glory of God reflected on Moses' face, which was too intense for the Israelites to behold. This reflects the holiness and otherness of God, which sinful humanity cannot fully endure. The veil also symbolizes the separation between God and man due to sin, a barrier that Christ would ultimately remove through His atoning work (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-13.htm">2 Corinthians 3:13-16</a>). The use of a veil indicates the need for a mediator and foreshadows the veil in the temple, which was torn at Christ's crucifixion, symbolizing direct access to God (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the mediator between God and His people.

The vail became part of his ordinary costume, and was worn excepting upon occasions of two kinds: (1) When Moses was alone with God, either in the temporary "tent of meeting" or in the permanent Tabernacle, he ceased to wear the vail, and spoke with God face to face; (2) when he had a message to the people from God, and spoke to them as God's representative, he authenticated his message by uncovering himself, and allowing the glory of his face to be seen. Otherwise, in his ordinary dealings with the people he went about veiled.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Till</span> <span class="cmt_word">Moses had done speaking with them</span>. The Hebrew text will not bear this rendering. All the ancient versions (LXX. Vulg. Syr. etc.) and the Targums agree that the meaning is - "when Moses had done speaking, he put a veil on his face." And this agrees with the plain meaning of vers. 34 and 35, which are to be taken connectedly. Moses first delivered his message with face unveiled, then he veiled himself, and thenceforth he wore a veil at all times except when he sought the Divine presence in the "tent of meeting" or the tabernacle, and when he delivered to the people any message sent them from God by him. He wore the veil ordinarily to prevent them from being dazzled. He took it off when he entered the tabernacle, that the Divine presence might shine fully on him and renew his strength. He kept it off when he returned, if he had any message to the people, until he had delivered it, in order the more fully to authenticate the message and shew to the people that it was from God. Then the <span class="cmt_word">children of Israel saw</span> <span class="cmt_word">the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone</span> (ver. 35). Having discharged himself of the message intrusted to him, he once more covered himself, and continued veiled until he again entered the tabernacle. The only objection that can be taken to this exegesis is derived from <a href="/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7-16</a>, which has been thought to imply that Moses wore the veil whenever he was in the sight of the people. But the passage does not really assert any such thing. It is quite enough for the argument, that under the old covenant a veil had been worn to conceal some of its glory. This concealment St. Paul contrasts with the openness of Christianity (vers. 13, 18); while at the same time he argues that it may be viewed as typical of that blindness and darkness which was characteristic of the Jewish nation of his day. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/34-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had finished</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7733;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3615.htm">Strong's 3615: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be complete, at an end, finished, accomplished, or spent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">speaking</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(mid&#183;dab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Verb - Piel - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to them,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;it&#183;t&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_854.htm">Strong's 854: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nearness, near, with, by, at, among</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he put</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a veil</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1493;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mas&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4533.htm">Strong's 4533: </a> </span><span class="str2">A veil</span><br /><br /><span class="word">over</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his face.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1430;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/34-33.htm">OT Law: Exodus 34:33 When Moses was done speaking with them (Exo.
