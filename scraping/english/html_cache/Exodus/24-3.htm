This moment follows the giving of the Ten Commandments and other laws on Mount Sinai. The phrase underscores Moses' role as a prophet and leader, chosen to communicate God's will. The "words and ordinances" refer to the covenantal laws that establish Israel as a nation set apart for God. This is a pivotal moment in the establishment of the Mosaic Covenant, which is foundational for Israel's identity and relationship with God.<p><b>they all responded with one voice:</b><br>The unity of the Israelites in their response signifies a collective commitment to the covenant. This communal agreement is crucial for the covenant's validity, as it requires the consent and participation of the entire nation. The phrase "with one voice" highlights the importance of unity and collective responsibility in the community of God's people. This unity is a precursor to the later establishment of Israel as a theocratic nation under God's rule.<p><b>&#8220;All the words that the LORD has spoken, we will do.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration is a solemn vow of obedience to God's commandments. It reflects the Israelites' willingness to enter into a covenant relationship with God, accepting both the blessings and responsibilities that come with it. This commitment is reminiscent of the covenantal promises made by their forefathers, such as Abraham's faith and obedience. The phrase foreshadows the New Covenant, where believers are called to live in obedience to Christ's teachings. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment of the law in Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeyed God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses acts as the mediator between God and the Israelites.
