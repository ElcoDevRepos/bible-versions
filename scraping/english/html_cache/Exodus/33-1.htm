It underscores the personal relationship between God and Moses, as seen in <a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>, where it is said that the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. This direct communication is a hallmark of Moses' leadership and his role as a mediator between God and the Israelites.<p><b>Leave this place</b><br>The command to "leave this place" refers to the Israelites' current location at Mount Sinai, where they had received the Law and built the Tabernacle. This marks a transition from a period of receiving divine instruction to a journey towards the fulfillment of God's promises. It signifies a shift from preparation to action, as the Israelites are now to move towards the Promised Land.<p><b>you and the people you brought up out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Moses' leadership in the Exodus, a pivotal event in Israelite history. It recalls the miraculous deliverance from slavery in Egypt, as described in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12-14</a>, and highlights Moses' role as a deliverer, a type of Christ who leads His people out of bondage. The reference to Egypt serves as a reminder of God's power and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises.<p><b>and go to the land that I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</b><br>This phrase connects the current journey to the patriarchal promises found in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 26</a>:3, and 28:13.

The intercession of Moses, and his offer to sacrifice himself for his people had obtained from God some great concessions, viz. - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the people's lives should be spared (<a href="/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>); <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> And that they should be led into Palestine (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 34) But a change had been introduced into the conditions under which the future journeys were to be made, somewhat obscurely indicated in the words - "Behold, mine angel shall go before thee" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>) - which was now to be more distinctly set forth. "God's angel" may mean his Presence in the Person of his Son - as it appears to mean in <a href="/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20-23</a> - or it may mean simply one of the created angelic host, which seems to be its sense in <a href="/exodus/32-34.htm">Exodus 32:34</a>, and in ver. 2 of this chapter. By vers. 2 and 3 taken in combination it was rendered manifest, both to Moses and to the people (ver. 4), that they were threatened with the loss of God's actual presence and personal protection during the remainder of their wanderings, and would have, instead of it, the mere guidance and help of an angel in the inferior sense of the word. This was felt to be "evil tidings" and the people consequently "mourned" and "stripped themselves of their ornaments" (ver. 6). Real penitence at last entered their hearts, and led to self-abasement. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said unto Moses</span>.
