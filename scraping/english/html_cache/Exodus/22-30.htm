The dedication of the firstborn is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing God's ownership and blessing. This practice is rooted in the Exodus narrative, where the firstborn of Egypt were struck down, but the firstborn of Israel were spared (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12-13</a>). The act of dedicating the firstborn acknowledges God's deliverance and sovereignty. Cattle and sheep were central to the agrarian economy of ancient Israel, and their dedication was a significant act of faith and obedience.<p><b>Let them stay with their mothers for seven days,</b><br>The seven-day period allows the newborn animals to gain strength and ensures their survival, reflecting a practical understanding of animal husbandry. The number seven is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing completeness or perfection, as seen in the creation narrative (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). This period also mirrors the time of purification and dedication seen in other biblical contexts, such as the circumcision of male infants on the eighth day (<a href="/leviticus/12-3.htm">Leviticus 12:3</a>).<p><b>but on the eighth day you are to give them to Me.</b><br>The eighth day marks a new beginning, a theme consistent throughout Scripture. In the context of circumcision, the eighth day signifies a covenant relationship with God (<a href="/genesis/17-12.htm">Genesis 17:12</a>). Here, the giving of the firstborn on the eighth day symbolizes a consecration to God, setting apart what is first and best for His purposes. This act prefigures the ultimate dedication and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is often seen as the firstborn over all creation (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>) and the perfect offering to God. The dedication of the firstborn animals serves as a type, pointing to the greater sacrifice of Christ, who fulfills the law and brings redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the law, God's chosen people, who are being instructed on how to live in covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/oxen_and_sheep.htm">Oxen and Sheep</a></b><br>Livestock that were central to the agrarian lifestyle of the Israelites and significant in their sacrificial system.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who is establishing His covenant and expectations with the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/eighth_day.htm">Eighth Day</a></b><br>A specific time frame that holds significance in biblical law and ritual, often associated with dedication and new beginnings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_system.htm">Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The broader context of the law, where offerings and sacrifices were a means of worship and atonement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_firstfruits.htm">Principle of Firstfruits</a></b><br>The command to give the firstborn to God reflects the broader biblical principle of offering the first and best to the Lord, acknowledging His sovereignty and provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/significance_of_the_eighth_day.htm">Significance of the Eighth Day</a></b><br>The eighth day symbolizes new beginnings and dedication, reminding believers of the importance of setting apart time and resources for God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holistic_worship.htm">Holistic Worship</a></b><br>The inclusion of livestock in worship practices underscores the idea that all aspects of life, including work and livelihood, are to be consecrated to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>By giving the firstborn animals to God, the Israelites were exercising faith in His continued provision, a principle that applies to trusting God with our resources today.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_22_30_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 22:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_30_s_call_for_daily_holiness.htm">How does Exodus 22:30 emphasize the importance of holiness in daily life?

The main object of forbidding sacrifice before the eighth day would appear to have beer-regard for the health and comfort of the mother, which needed the relief obtained by suckling its offspring. There may also have underlain the prohibition some reference to birth as an impure process. Compare the circumcision of the male child on the eighth day.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seven days it shall be with its dam</span>.

The main object is that the darn may have during that time the natural relief derivable from suckling its off-spring. <span class="cmt_word">On the eighth day thou shalt give it me</span>. Some analogy may be traced between this proviso and the law of circumcision. Birth was viewed as an unclean process, and nothing was fit for presentation to God excepting after an interval. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/22-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You shall do</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">likewise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1469;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#234;n-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with your cattle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1430;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
