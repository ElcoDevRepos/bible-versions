The number eight in biblical numerology often signifies new beginnings or a new order, which can be seen as symbolic of the new covenant God was establishing with His people. The frames were made of acacia wood, a durable and resistant material, symbolizing the enduring nature of God's covenant.<p><b>and sixteen silver bases</b><br>The silver bases provided stability and support for the frames. Silver in the Bible often represents redemption and atonement. In <a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>, silver was collected as atonement money, linking the material to the concept of redemption. The use of silver bases can be seen as a foundation of redemption upon which the Tabernacle, and thus the presence of God, rests. The number sixteen, being a multiple of eight, reinforces the idea of a new beginning and completeness in God's plan.<p><b>two under each frame</b><br>Each frame was supported by two silver bases, ensuring stability and balance. This duality can symbolize the balance between justice and mercy, law and grace, which are foundational to God's relationship with His people. The precise and orderly construction of the Tabernacle reflects God's nature as a God of order and detail. This meticulous design points forward to the New Testament, where Jesus Christ is described as the cornerstone (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>), providing the ultimate foundation for the spiritual house of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the Tabernacle from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary that the Israelites used during their journey in the wilderness, representing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were on their journey to the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where Moses received the Ten Commandments and the detailed instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_attention_to_detail.htm">God's Attention to Detail</a></b><br>The specific instructions for the Tabernacle remind us that God cares about the details of our lives and our worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were called to follow God's precise instructions, we are called to obey His Word in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_presence_of_god.htm">The Presence of God</a></b><br>The Tabernacle symbolizes God's desire to dwell among His people, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_cooperation.htm">Community and Cooperation</a></b><br>The construction of the Tabernacle required the cooperation of the entire community, illustrating the importance of working together in the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/foreshadowing_of_christ.htm">Foreshadowing of Christ</a></b><br>The Tabernacle serves as a foreshadowing of Christ's redemptive work and the ultimate dwelling of God with His people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_26_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 26:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_26_25_God_s_detailed_plan.htm">How does Exodus 26:25 demonstrate God's attention to detail in His instructions?
