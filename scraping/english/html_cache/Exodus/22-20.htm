Sacrifices were made to deities as acts of devotion, appeasement, or thanksgiving. In the context of the Israelites, sacrifices were to be made exclusively to Yahweh, the one true God. This command underscores the monotheistic nature of Israelite religion, contrasting with the polytheistic practices of surrounding nations such as the Canaanites, Egyptians, and Mesopotamians, who worshipped multiple gods and engaged in various sacrificial rituals.<p><b>other than the LORD alone</b><br>The exclusivity of worship to Yahweh is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. The first of the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) states, "You shall have no other gods before Me." This commandment emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God demands exclusive worship and loyalty. The phrase "the LORD alone" highlights the unique identity of Yahweh as the sole deity worthy of worship, setting the Israelites apart from other nations. This exclusivity is further reinforced in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, the Shema, which declares, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one."<p><b>he must be set apart for destruction</b><br>The phrase "set apart for destruction" indicates a severe consequence for idolatry, reflecting the seriousness of the offense. In the Hebrew context, this often meant being devoted to destruction or being put to death, as seen in the concept of "herem," where something is devoted to God for destruction. This punishment served as a deterrent against idolatry and maintained the purity of the Israelite community. The severity of this command is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6-10</a>, where even close relatives who entice others to worship other gods are to be put to death. This reflects the holiness and justice of God, who cannot tolerate idolatry among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of the laws given in Exodus, including this commandment, were the Israelites, God's chosen people, who were being formed into a nation under God's covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai and communicated them to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God delivered the Ten Commandments and other laws to Moses, including the commandment in <a href="/exodus/22-20.htm">Exodus 22:20</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pagan_nations.htm">Pagan Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding nations that worshiped multiple gods, whose practices were forbidden to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God who delivered the Israelites from Egypt and established a covenant with them, demanding exclusive worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/exclusive_worship.htm">Exclusive Worship</a></b><br>God demands exclusive worship.
