This reflects the cultural practice of hospitality and neighborly relations in ancient times. The act of asking rather than taking by force highlights a divine orchestration rather than human rebellion. This request is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>, where God foretold that his descendants would leave their place of bondage with great possessions.<p><b>for silver and gold jewelry and clothing</b><br>Silver and gold were symbols of wealth and status in ancient Egypt, often used in religious and ceremonial contexts. Jewelry and clothing were not only valuable but also practical for the journey ahead. The acquisition of these items can be seen as a form of recompense for the years of slavery and labor the Israelites endured. This also prefigures the wealth that would later be used in the construction of the Tabernacle, as described in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-31</a>.<p><b>and you will put them on your sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase indicates that the wealth obtained would be used to adorn the next generation, symbolizing a transfer of blessing and a new identity for the Israelites. It signifies a break from their past as slaves and a step towards becoming a free and prosperous nation. The act of adorning their children can also be seen as a preparation for their future role as God's chosen people.<p><b>So you will plunder the Egyptians.</b><br>The term "plunder" typically implies taking spoils of war, yet here it is achieved through peaceful means, underscoring the divine intervention in the Israelites' favor. This act fulfills God's promise and serves as a judgment against Egypt for their oppression. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's people over their enemies, a theme that resonates throughout the Bible, culminating in the victory of Christ over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

Some of the Israelites, it would seem, took in Egyptian lodgers superior to them in wealth and rank. This implies more friendly feeling between the two nations than we should have expected; but it is quite natural that, after their long stay in Egypt, the Hebrews should have made a certain number of the Egyptians their friends. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/3-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Every</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;i&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">woman shall ask</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
