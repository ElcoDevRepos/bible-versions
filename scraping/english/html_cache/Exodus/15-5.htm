The "depths" signify the deep waters of the sea, emphasizing the totality and finality of the Egyptians' defeat. This event is a demonstration of God's power and protection over His people, fulfilling His promise to deliver them from slavery. The covering of the Egyptians by the sea can be seen as a form of divine judgment, reminiscent of the flood in Genesis where the waters covered the earth as a judgment against sin.<p><b>they sank there like a stone.</b><br>The imagery of sinking "like a stone" highlights the sudden and irreversible nature of the Egyptians' demise. This simile emphasizes the weight and finality of their defeat, as stones quickly and irretrievably sink to the bottom of the water. This phrase also serves as a contrast to the Israelites, who walked on dry ground, illustrating the stark difference between those who are under God's protection and those who oppose Him. The sinking of the Egyptians can be seen as a type of the ultimate defeat of evil, pointing forward to the final victory of God over His enemies. This imagery is echoed in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/jeremiah/51-63.htm">Jeremiah 51:63-64</a>, where Babylon's fall is symbolized by a stone sinking in the Euphrates.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and witnessed the miraculous parting of the Red Sea.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The oppressors of the Israelites, who pursued them into the Red Sea and were ultimately defeated.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The body of water that God miraculously parted to allow the Israelites to escape from the Egyptians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who, under God's command, led the people out of Egypt and through the Red Sea.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_song_of_moses.htm">The Song of Moses</a></b><br>A song of praise and thanksgiving sung by Moses and the Israelites after their deliverance from the Egyptians.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>The event at the Red Sea demonstrates God's supreme power over nature and His ability to deliver His people from seemingly impossible situations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_deliverance.htm">Judgment and Deliverance</a></b><br>The sinking of the Egyptians serves as a reminder of God's judgment against those who oppose Him and His deliverance of those who trust in Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_obedience.htm">Faith and Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' crossing of the Red Sea required faith and obedience to God's command, illustrating the importance of trusting God even when the path seems uncertain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/remembrance_and_praise.htm">Remembrance and Praise</a></b><br>The Song of Moses is a model for remembering and praising God for His mighty works and faithfulness in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_15_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 15:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_15_5_God_s_power_over_foes.htm">How does Exodus 15:5 illustrate God's power over nature and enemies?

God didn&#8217;t allow the Egyptians to tread water; He dropped them into the deepest part. This echoes the creation account where &#8220;darkness was over the surface of the deep&#8221; and the Spirit ruled it (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>). Later, the psalmist recalls, &#8220;The waters saw You, O God&#8230; the depths trembled&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/77-16.htm">Psalm 77:16</a>). Jonah felt the same power: &#8220;You cast me into the deep&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3</a>). Every time Scripture mentions &#8220;the depths,&#8221; it reminds us that even the most unmanageable forces answer to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>have covered them</b><p>The verb is final&#8212;no sliver of chariot wheel or soldier&#8217;s helmet remained visible. <a href="/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a> states, &#8220;The waters returned and covered the chariots and horsemen.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/106-11.htm">Psalm 106:11</a> looks back: &#8220;The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.&#8221; God&#8217;s judgment is thorough, leaving nothing half-done.<p>&#8226; Completeness underscores justice: the oppressors who &#8220;covered&#8221; Israel with cruel labor are themselves covered.<p>&#8226; It also highlights deliverance: when God shields His people, the enemy cannot re-emerge (<a href="/isaiah/43-17.htm">Isaiah 43:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they sank there</b><p>&#8220;Sink&#8221; suggests speed and certainty.
