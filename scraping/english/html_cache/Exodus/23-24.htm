In the ancient Near East, polytheism was prevalent, and the Israelites were surrounded by nations worshiping multiple deities. Bowing down signifies submission and reverence, which God reserves for Himself alone (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). This prohibition is a call to maintain spiritual purity and allegiance to Yahweh, rejecting the idolatry that could lead them astray.<p><b>or serve them</b><br>Serving other gods implies engaging in rituals, sacrifices, and practices dedicated to these deities. This service often included acts that were morally and spiritually corrupt, such as child sacrifice or temple prostitution, which were common in Canaanite religion. The Israelites are reminded that their service is to be directed solely to God, as seen in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>), which calls for love and service to God with all one's heart, soul, and strength.<p><b>or follow their practices</b><br>The practices of the surrounding nations often included detestable acts in the sight of God (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-12</a>). These practices could include divination, sorcery, and other forms of occultism. The Israelites are warned not to adopt these customs, as they are contrary to the holiness God requires. This call to separation is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are urged not to conform to the patterns of this world (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p><b>Instead, you are to demolish them</b><br>The command to demolish the idols and places of worship of other gods is a call to eradicate the influence of idolatry completely. This action symbolizes a total rejection and cleansing of anything that could lead the Israelites away from God. It reflects the seriousness with which God views idolatry and the need for His people to be distinct and set apart (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>).<p><b>and smash their sacred stones to pieces</b><br>Sacred stones, or standing stones, were often used in pagan worship as symbols of the deities or as altars. By smashing these stones, the Israelites were to make a public declaration of the powerlessness of these gods and the supremacy of Yahweh. This act of destruction is a physical manifestation of spiritual warfare, prefiguring the ultimate victory over sin and idolatry through Jesus Christ, who is the cornerstone of faith (<a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being instructed on how to live in the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_nations.htm">Canaanite Nations</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the land that the Israelites are entering, who worship false gods and engage in idolatrous practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God who commands the Israelites to remain faithful to Him and reject the idolatry of the surrounding nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The worship of false gods, which is strictly forbidden by God and is a central issue in this passage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/exclusive_worship.htm">Exclusive Worship</a></b><br>God demands exclusive worship and loyalty.

All the abominations mentioned in <a href="/context/leviticus/18-6.htm" title="None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:6-23</a> were practised widely among them before they were dispossessed of their territory (<a href="/context/leviticus/18-24.htm" title="Defile not you yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>). No doubt the idolatry and the profligacy were closely connected, as among idolatrous nations generally; but it was for their profligacy rather than their idolatry that they were driven out. Thus it was necessary to warn Israel against both.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt . . . quite break down their images.</span>--Conquerors generally preserved the idols of the conquered nations as trophies of victory; to do so was forbidden to the Israelites. Idolatry had such a powerful and subtle attraction for them, that there was danger of their being seduced into it unless the entire apparatus of the idol-worship were destroyed and made away with. Hence the present injunctions, and others similar to them. (Comp. <a href="/exodus/34-13.htm" title="But you shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm" title="But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>; &c.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works</span>. It is always to be borne in mind that with the idolatries of the heathen were connected "works of darkness," which it is shameful even to speak cf. The rites of Baal and Ashtoreth, of Chemosh, Molech, Rimmon, and the other Canaanite and Syrian deities were at once defiled by the abomination of human sacrifices, and polluted with the still more debasing evil of religious impurity. "The sacrifice offered to Ash-toreth," says Dr. Dollinger, "consisted in the prostitution of women: the women submitted themselves to the visitors of the feast, in the temple of the goddess or the adjoining precinct. A legend told of Astarte (Ashtoreth) having prostituted herself in Tyre for ten years: and in many places matrons, as well as maidens, consecrated themselves for a length of time, or on the festivals of the goddess, with a view of propitiating her, or earning her favour as <span class="accented">hieroduli</span> of unchastity... In this way they went so far at last as to contemplate the abominations of unnatural lust as a homage rendered to the deity, and to exalt it into a regular cultus. The worship of the goddess at Aphaca in Lebanon was specially notorious in this respect. The temple in a solitary situation was, as Eusebius tells us, a place of evil-doing for such as chose to ruin their bodies in scandalous ways... Criminal intercourse with women, impurity, shameful and degrading deeds, were practised in the temple, where there was no custom and no law, and no honourable or decent human being could be found." (<span class="accented">Jew and Gentile</span>, vol. 1. pp. 428, 429; Darnell's translation.) <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt</span> <span class="cmt_word">utterly overthrow them.</span> The heathen gods are identified with their images. These were to be torn from their bases, overthrown, and rolled in the dust for greater contempt and ignominy. They were then to be broken up and burnt, till the gold and the silver with which they were overlaid was calcined and could be stamped to powder. Nothing was to be spared that had been degraded by idolatry, either for its beauty or its elaborate workmanship, or its value.
