Historically, the fear of God among Israel's enemies is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>, where Rahab speaks of the terror that fell upon Jericho. The fear and dread are not just emotional responses but are indicative of God's sovereign power over all nations.<p><b>By the power of Your arm</b><br>The "arm" of God symbolizes His strength and might. In biblical literature, God's arm is often associated with deliverance and judgment. <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a> speaks of the "arm of the LORD" being revealed, which Christians interpret as a prophecy of Jesus Christ's redemptive work. The power of God's arm is a reminder of His ability to save and protect His people.<p><b>they will be as still as a stone</b><br>This imagery suggests complete paralysis and helplessness among the enemies of Israel. The metaphor of being "still as a stone" indicates an overwhelming fear that renders them incapable of action. This can be compared to the reaction of the Canaanite kings in <a href="/joshua/5.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>, who were paralyzed with fear upon hearing of Israel's crossing of the Jordan River.<p><b>until Your people pass by, O LORD</b><br>The phrase emphasizes God's protection and provision for His people. The crossing of the Red Sea is a type of baptism, symbolizing the transition from slavery to freedom. This passage foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>, where Paul refers to the Israelites' passage through the sea as a form of baptism.<p><b>until the people You have bought pass by.</b><br>The concept of being "bought" by God introduces the idea of redemption. In the Old Testament, God "bought" Israel by delivering them from Egypt, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>. This prefigures the New Testament understanding of redemption through Christ's sacrifice, as believers are "bought with a price" (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>), signifying their deliverance from sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, whom He delivered from slavery in Egypt.
