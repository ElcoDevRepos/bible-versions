Leaven, or yeast, symbolizes sin and corruption due to its fermenting process. The seven-day period represents completeness and total purification. This practice is a reminder of the haste with which the Israelites left Egypt, not having time to let their bread rise.

When the "exclusiveness" of the Hebrews is made a charge against them, justice requires us to remember that from the first it was open to those who were not of Hebrew blood to share in the Hebrew privileges by accepting the covenant of circumcision, and joining themselves to the nation. It was in this way that the Kenites. and even the Gibeonites, became reckoned to Israel.<p><span class= "bld">Born in the land.</span>--Hob., <span class= "ital">natives of the land: i.e.,</span> of Canaan.

We are thus reminded, at the very time when Israel is about to become a nation and to enter upon its inheritance of exclusive privileges, that no exclusion of the Gentiles by reason of race or descent was ever contemplated by God, either at the giving of the law, or at any other time. In Abraham all the families of them were to be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). It was always open to any Gentiles to join themselves to Israel by becoming "proselytes of justice," adopting circumcision and the general observance of the law, and joining the Israelite community.
