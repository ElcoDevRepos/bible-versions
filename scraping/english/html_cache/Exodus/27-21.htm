It served as the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The design and construction of the Tabernacle were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai, emphasizing its divine origin and significance.<p><b>outside the veil that is in front of the Testimony</b><br>The veil separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place, where the Ark of the Covenant, also known as the Testimony, was kept. This veil symbolized the separation between God and humanity due to sin. The presence of the Ark, containing the tablets of the Law, represented God's covenant with Israel. The veil's tearing at Christ's crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>) signifies the removal of this separation through Jesus' atoning sacrifice.<p><b>Aaron and his sons are to tend the lamps</b><br>Aaron, the first high priest, and his sons were responsible for maintaining the lamps on the golden lampstand, or menorah, in the Holy Place. This duty highlights the priestly role of mediating between God and the people, ensuring that the light of God's presence was continually visible. The lamps symbolize spiritual illumination and the guidance of God, paralleling Jesus as the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><b>before the LORD from evening until morning</b><br>The lamps were to burn continually from evening until morning, signifying God's perpetual presence and watchfulness over Israel. This practice underscores the importance of constant vigilance and devotion in worship. The imagery of light in darkness also points to the hope and guidance provided by God, fulfilled in Christ's coming as the light shining in the darkness (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>).<p><b>This is to be a permanent statute for the Israelites</b><br>The command for the lamps to be tended was not temporary but intended as a lasting ordinance, reflecting the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel. It underscores the importance of obedience and faithfulness in maintaining the relationship with God. This permanence is echoed in the New Covenant, where believers are called to be a light to the world (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>).<p><b>for the generations to come</b><br>The instruction was meant to be observed by future generations, ensuring that the knowledge and worship of God were passed down. This continuity emphasizes the communal and intergenerational aspect of faith, as seen in the repeated biblical theme of teaching God's laws to one's children (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>). It also foreshadows the eternal nature of Christ's priesthood and kingdom (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>This was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where He would meet with Moses and the priests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and his sons</a></b><br>Aaron, the brother of Moses, was the first high priest, and his sons were appointed to serve as priests in the Tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_veil.htm">The Veil</a></b><br>A curtain that separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place in the Tabernacle, symbolizing the separation between God and humanity due to sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_testimony.htm">The Testimony</a></b><br>Refers to the tablets of the Ten Commandments, which were kept in the Ark of the Covenant within the Most Holy Place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamps.htm">The Lamps</a></b><br>These were part of the golden lampstand (Menorah) in the Holy Place, symbolizing God's light and presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/perpetual_service.htm">Perpetual Service</a></b><br>The command for Aaron and his sons to tend the lamps "from evening until morning" highlights the importance of continuous service and vigilance in our spiritual lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_light.htm">Symbolism of Light</a></b><br>The lamps symbolize God's presence and guidance.
