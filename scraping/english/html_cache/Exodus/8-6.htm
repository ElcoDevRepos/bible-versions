The act of stretching out his hand signifies the authority given to him by God to perform miracles. The waters of Egypt, particularly the Nile, were central to Egyptian life and economy, symbolizing both sustenance and divine power. This act challenges the Egyptian gods, particularly Hapi, the god of the Nile, demonstrating the superiority of the God of Israel. The stretching out of the hand is a recurring motif in the plagues, symbolizing divine intervention and judgment.<p><b>and the frogs came up</b><br>Frogs were associated with the Egyptian goddess Heqet, who was depicted with a frog's head and symbolized fertility and life. The multiplication of frogs was a direct affront to this deity, showing that the God of Israel had control over creation and the natural order. This plague, like others, was a sign to Pharaoh and the Egyptians of God's power and a call to let the Israelites go. The frogs coming up from the waters also symbolize the disruption of the natural order, as they invade spaces where they do not belong.<p><b>and covered the land of Egypt</b><br>The phrase indicates the extent and severity of the plague. The frogs were not confined to the Nile but spread throughout the land, affecting daily life and causing distress. This widespread coverage emphasizes the totality of God's judgment and the inability of the Egyptian magicians to reverse it. The land of Egypt, a symbol of power and civilization, is shown to be vulnerable to the God of Israel. This foreshadows the eventual liberation of the Israelites and the downfall of Egyptian power. The covering of the land also prefigures the comprehensive nature of God's deliverance and judgment seen throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

Each gesture reminds us that God works tangibly through chosen servants (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal stretching signals delegated authority&#8212;Aaron is acting for Moses, and Moses for God (<a href="/exodus/4-16.htm">Exodus 4:16</a>). The scene affirms that the Lord&#8217;s word is absolutely reliable and accomplishes what He sends it to do (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Over the waters of Egypt</b><p>&#8226; Targeting the water stresses God&#8217;s supremacy over Egypt&#8217;s lifeline, the Nile, revered as divine (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The Nile had just been humiliated by turning to blood; now it becomes the source of another humiliation&#8212;an endless invasion of frogs (<a href="/psalms/105-29.htm">Psalm 105:29&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; By repeating judgment on the same element, God stacks evidence that every corner of creation answers to Him (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the frogs came up</b><p>&#8226; The states, &#8220;the frogs came up,&#8221; underscoring a literal, sudden surge.

The Lord turns Egypt&#8217;s cherished river into the launching point for a nation-wide plague of frogs. By overwhelming every corner of the land, God exposes Egypt&#8217;s idols, asserts His unmatched sovereignty, and calls Pharaoh to humble obedience. The verse assures believers today that God&#8217;s word is unfailingly accurate, His judgments are purposeful, and His covenant people can trust His mighty hand in every circumstance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">The frogs came up.</span>--Hebrew, <span class= "ital">the frog.</span> The term designates the species.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The frogs came up</span>.
