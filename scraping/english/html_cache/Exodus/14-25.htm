The chariots, symbols of Egyptian military might, are rendered ineffective by God's direct action. This act demonstrates God's supremacy over human power and technology. The Hebrew term used here can imply a sense of confusion or chaos, suggesting that God not only physically disrupted the chariots but also sowed disorder among the Egyptian forces. This mirrors earlier plagues where God systematically dismantled Egyptian confidence and control.<p><b>so that they had difficulty driving</b><br>The difficulty in driving the chariots underscores the futility of opposing God's will. The Egyptians, known for their advanced chariotry, find themselves powerless, emphasizing the theme of divine judgment. This moment is a turning point, illustrating that human strength and skill are insufficient against divine intervention. The narrative echoes earlier instances where God hardened Pharaoh's heart, showing that resistance to God's plan leads to inevitable downfall.<p><b>&#8220;Let us flee from the Israelites,&#8221; said the Egyptians</b><br>The Egyptians' realization marks a significant shift in the narrative. Previously confident in their pursuit, they now recognize the futility of their efforts. This acknowledgment of defeat is a fulfillment of God's promise to deliver Israel with a mighty hand. The Egyptians' fear contrasts with the Israelites' growing faith, highlighting the theme of God's protection and deliverance. This moment foreshadows future instances where Israel's enemies recognize God's power, such as in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a> with Rahab's confession.<p><b>&#8220;for the LORD is fighting for them against Egypt!&#8221;</b><br>This declaration by the Egyptians serves as a powerful testimony to God's sovereignty and faithfulness. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) signifies the personal and covenantal nature of God's relationship with Israel. The Egyptians' recognition of God's intervention fulfills the purpose of the plagues: to demonstrate His power and make His name known among the nations. This acknowledgment prefigures the ultimate victory of God over all earthly powers, a theme echoed in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, where Christ is depicted as the divine warrior.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who intervenes directly in the events to deliver His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The oppressors of the Israelites, pursuing them to bring them back into slavery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, fleeing from Egyptian bondage towards the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The body of water that the Israelites crossed, which God used as a means of deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/chariots_and_wheels.htm">Chariots and Wheels</a></b><br>The military technology of the Egyptians, which God rendered ineffective.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_deliverance.htm">God's Sovereignty in Deliverance</a></b><br>God is in control of all circumstances, even those that seem insurmountable.
