Genealogies serve to establish the historical and familial context of the narrative. In this case, it emphasizes the continuity of God's covenant with the patriarchs and the fulfillment of His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The "heads of their fathers' houses" indicates leadership and authority within the tribal structure, which was crucial for maintaining order and identity among the Israelites.<p><b>The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel:</b><br>Reuben, as the firstborn of Jacob (Israel), held a position of prominence, though he lost his birthright due to his transgression with Bilhah, his father's concubine (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>; 49:3-4). This loss of status is significant in understanding the dynamics within Jacob's family and the eventual rise of Judah and Joseph as leading tribes. The mention of Reuben here underscores the importance of lineage and the fulfillment of God's promises through all the tribes of Israel.<p><b>were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi:</b><br>These names represent the sons of Reuben and the founders of the clans that bear their names. Each name carries its own significance and contributes to the identity of the tribe of Reuben. Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi are mentioned in other genealogical records, such as <a href="/numbers/26-5.htm">Numbers 26:5-9</a>, which helps to confirm the historical reliability of these accounts. The repetition of these names in various genealogies highlights the importance of family heritage and the preservation of tribal identity.<p><b>These were the clans of Reuben:</b><br>The term "clans" refers to the subdivisions within the tribe, each led by a descendant of Reuben's sons. This structure was essential for organizing the people of Israel, especially during their wilderness journey and the subsequent settlement in the Promised Land. The clans of Reuben, like those of other tribes, played a role in the allocation of land and resources, as well as in military and religious duties. The mention of Reuben's clans here serves to remind the reader of the broader narrative of Israel's development as a nation and the fulfillment of God's covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben.htm">Reuben</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Jacob (Israel) and Leah.

They occupy quite as prominent a position in Arabian as in Jewish history. The descent of a man who aspired to be a leader would be a subject of curiosity, with a Semitic people, to all those who submitted themselves to his guidance; and Moses naturally inserts his at the point where, fully accepting the post of leader, he came forward and commenced his struggle with Pharaoh for the emancipation of his nation. A "father's house" is a family. (See <a href="/numbers/1-2.htm" title="Take you the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls;">Numbers 1:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-18.htm" title="And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.">Numbers 1:18</a>.)<p>(14, 15) <span class= "bld">Reuben . . .

By "fathers' houses" are meant families (see <a href="/1_chronicles/4-38.htm">1 Chronicles 4:38</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/5-13.htm">1 Chronicles 5:13</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/7-40.htm">1 Chronicles 7:40</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/9-9.htm">1 Chronicles 9:9</a>, etc.); and "the heads of fathers' houses" are simply the acknowledged chiefs and founders of families. The main families of the tribe of Reuben were those of Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carrel, actual sons of the patriarch (See <a href="/genesis/46-9.htm">Genesis 46:9</a>; and compare <a href="/1_chronicles/5-3.htm">1 Chronicles 5:3</a>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/6-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were the heads</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#353;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7218.htm">Strong's 7218: </a> </span><span class="str2">The head</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of their fathers&#8217;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
