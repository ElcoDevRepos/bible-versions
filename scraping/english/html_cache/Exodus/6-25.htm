Eleazar succeeded Aaron as high priest, highlighting the importance of the priestly role in mediating between God and the Israelites.<p><b>married one of the daughters of Putiel</b><br>The identity of Putiel is not well-documented, but the mention of his daughter indicates the importance of maintaining purity and continuity within the priestly line.

This marriage also reflects the broader cultural practice of arranged marriages to strengthen family and tribal alliances.<p><b>and she bore him Phinehas</b><br>Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, is noted for his zealousness for God, particularly in <a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>, where he took decisive action against idolatry and immorality among the Israelites.
