His role was crucial in communicating God's instructions to the Israelites. The "whole congregation of Israel" refers to the entire assembly of the Israelites, who had recently been delivered from slavery in Egypt. This moment occurs in the wilderness, shortly after the Exodus, highlighting the importance of leadership and communication in guiding the people through their journey.<p><b>they looked toward the desert</b><br>The desert, or wilderness, is a significant setting in the biblical narrative. It represents a place of testing, reliance on God, and spiritual formation. The Israelites' journey through the desert was a time of learning to trust in God's provision and guidance. The desert also symbolizes a place of encounter with God, as seen in other biblical accounts such as Moses' encounter with the burning bush.<p><b>and there in a cloud</b><br>The cloud is a recurring symbol of God's presence and guidance throughout the Exodus narrative. It served as a visible manifestation of God's presence, leading the Israelites by day as a pillar of cloud and by night as a pillar of fire. The cloud signifies God's protection and the mystery of His divine presence, which is both near and yet beyond human comprehension.<p><b>the glory of the LORD appeared</b><br>The "glory of the LORD" refers to the visible manifestation of God's divine presence and majesty. In the Old Testament, God's glory often appeared in the form of a cloud or fire, signifying His holiness and power. This appearance reassured the Israelites of God's continued presence and faithfulness. The concept of God's glory is further developed in the New Testament, where it is ultimately revealed in the person of Jesus Christ, who is described as the "radiance of God's glory" (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
