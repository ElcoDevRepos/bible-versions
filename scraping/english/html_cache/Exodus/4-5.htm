In the context of the Exodus narrative, belief is crucial for the Israelites to trust Moses as their leader and God's chosen instrument for their deliverance. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where signs and wonders are used to confirm divine authority and mission, as seen in the ministries of prophets and Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>).<p><b>that the LORD,</b><br>The use of "LORD" in all capital letters signifies the divine name YHWH, emphasizing God's covenantal relationship with Israel. This name is first revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, where God declares, "I AM WHO I AM." It underscores God's eternal, self-existent nature and His faithfulness to His promises.<p><b>the God of their fathers&#8212;</b><br>This phrase connects the current generation of Israelites with their ancestral heritage, reminding them of the longstanding covenant relationship. It serves to reassure the Israelites that the God who is acting now is the same God who was faithful to their ancestors, reinforcing continuity and trust in His promises.<p><b>the God of Abraham,</b><br>Abraham is the patriarch with whom God first established His covenant, promising numerous descendants and a land for his offspring (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). This reference to Abraham underscores the fulfillment of God's promises and His ongoing commitment to the covenant, which is foundational to Israel's identity and hope.<p><b>the God of Isaac,</b><br>Isaac, the son of promise, represents the continuation of God's covenant with Abraham. The mention of Isaac highlights God's faithfulness in preserving the covenant line and His miraculous provision, as seen in Isaac's birth to Sarah in her old age (<a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-3</a>).<p><b>and the God of Jacob&#8212;</b><br>Jacob, later named Israel, is the father of the twelve tribes. His life is marked by encounters with God, such as the vision at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-22</a>) and wrestling with the angel (<a href="/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22-32</a>). This reference emphasizes God's personal involvement and transformative power in the lives of His people.<p><b>has appeared to you.</b><br>The appearance of God to Moses is a theophany, a direct encounter with the divine. This validates Moses' prophetic authority and mission. The burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-4</a>) is a significant theophany, symbolizing God's holiness and His call to deliver Israel. This encounter prefigures the ultimate revelation of God in Jesus Christ, who is the visible image of the invisible God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is called by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
