Their actions are in direct response to God's command, demonstrating their faith and trust in God's plan. This obedience is crucial as it sets the stage for the subsequent plagues and the eventual liberation of the Israelites from Egypt. The partnership between Moses and Aaron is significant, as Aaron serves as Moses' spokesperson due to Moses' own admission of being "slow of speech" (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>). This teamwork reflects the importance of collaboration in fulfilling God's purposes.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded them.</b><br>The phrase underscores the importance of following God's instructions precisely. This obedience is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, where blessings and success are often linked to adherence to God's commands. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of covenant faithfulness, where God's people are called to live according to His statutes. In the context of Exodus, this obedience is pivotal as it leads to the demonstration of God's power through the plagues, ultimately resulting in the deliverance of the Israelites.
