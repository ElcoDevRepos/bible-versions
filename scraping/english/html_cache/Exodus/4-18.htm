The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah, indicating a shared ancestry with the Israelites.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;Please let me return to my brothers in Egypt</b><br>Moses refers to the Israelites as his "brothers," highlighting his identification with them despite his upbringing in Pharaoh's palace.

It also reflects Moses' humility and the importance of seeking permission before leaving.<p><b>to see if they are still alive.&#8221;</b><br>Moses' concern for the Israelites' well-being is evident here.

The tribal tie was close, and would make the asking of permission for even a temporary absence the proper, if not even the necessary, course Apart from this, Moses would have had to "return," in order to restore the flock, which he was tending, to its owner. (See <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm" title="Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.">Exodus 3:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">My brethren.</span>--Not "my nation," for Moses could not doubt that some survived; nor "my actual brothers," for he had but one brother; but, "my relations," or "my family," my kith and kin. Let me go and see whether my relatives survive, or whether they have succumbed to the tyranny of the Pharaoh. It is certain that this was not Moses' sole motive, not even his main motive for wishing to return to Egypt; but, as it was among his motives, he was within his right in putting it forward, and omitting to mention others.<p><span class= "bld">Jethro said, Go in peace.</span>--Jethro's character is altogether one of which kindness and peacefulness are the main elements. If he be identified with Reuel, the pleasing picture drawn in <a href="/context/exodus/2-18.htm" title="And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you are come so soon to day?">Exodus 2:18-21</a> will furnish traits towards his portraiture. Even without this, the present passage and the notice in Exodus 18 sufficiently delineate him. He is a sort of second Melchizedek, both priest and king, a worshipper of the true God, and one in whose presence both Moses and Aaron are content to play a secondary part (<a href="/exodus/18-9.htm" title="And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.">Exodus 18:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/18-12.htm" title="And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.">Exodus 18:12</a>). But he never asserts himself; he is always kind, gentle, acquiescent, helpful. He might easily have made a difficulty at the present point of the narrative, have demurred to the weakening of the tribe by the withdrawal of an important member from it, have positively refused to allow of the departure of 'Zipporah and her children. But his words are simply "Go in peace." He consents, and does not mar the grace of his act by any show of reluctance. He lets Moses take his wife and children. He afterwards receives them back, and protects them (<a href="/exodus/18-2.htm" title="Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,">Exodus 18:2</a>); and, finally, when his protection is no more needed, he restores them to their natural guardian, by a spontaneous act, as it would seem. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-25.</span> - If Moses had, as we have supposed, been accepted into the Midianitish nation, he would need permission to withdraw himself from the tribal head. This head was now Jether, or Jethro, Moses' connexion by marriage, perhaps his brother-in-law, perhaps a less near connexion. Nations and tribes were at this time anxious to keep up their numbers, and jealous of the desertion even of a single member. Jethro, however, made no opposition to the return of Moses to Egypt, even though he designed to be accompanied by his wife and sons (ver. 20). Scripture gives no indications of the motives which actuated him. Perhaps the Midianites were at this time straitened for want of room. Perhaps the peculiar circumstances of Moses were held to justify his application for leave. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My brethren</span> probably means here "my relations" (compare <a href="/genesis/13-8.htm">Genesis 13:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/29-12.htm">Genesis 29:12</a>). Moses could scarcely doubt but that some of his countrymen were still living. It would not have been for the interest of the Egyptians to exterminate them. <span class="cmt_word">Go in peace</span> means, "you have my leave - I do not oppose your going." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/4-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
