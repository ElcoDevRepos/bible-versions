This detail reflects the meticulous instructions given by God for the construction of the tabernacle, emphasizing the need for precision and care in worship. The proximity to the rim suggests ease of access and functionality, ensuring that the table could be carried without difficulty. This design choice highlights the practical aspects of worship, where every element serves a purpose in facilitating the Israelites' relationship with God.<p><b>to serve as holders for the poles</b><br>The rings served a specific function as holders for the poles, which were essential for the mobility of the tabernacle. This reflects the nomadic lifestyle of the Israelites during their wilderness journey, where the tabernacle needed to be portable. The use of poles and rings ensured that the sacred objects could be transported without being touched directly, preserving their sanctity. This design also foreshadows the concept of God's presence being with His people wherever they go, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture.<p><b>used to carry the table</b><br>The table referred to here is the Table of Showbread, which held the bread of the Presence, symbolizing God's provision and covenant with Israel. The ability to carry the table underscores the transient nature of the Israelites' journey and their reliance on God's guidance. This portability is a reminder of the temporary nature of earthly dwellings and the eternal promise of God's presence. The carrying of the table also prefigures the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the Bread of Life, who sustains and accompanies believers on their spiritual journey.<div

mentioning &#8220;the rings.&#8221; These were four solid-gold fittings affixed to the legs of the table of the bread of the Presence (cf. <a href="/exodus/37-13.htm">Exodus 37:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/25-26.htm">Exodus 25:26&#8211;27</a>). God instructed Bezalel to fashion them exactly as He had described to Moses on Sinai. The rings testified that every detail of worship was designed by the LORD, not left to human invention (<a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Gold, a symbol of purity and royalty, reminds us that fellowship with God is precious (<a href="/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The rings&#8217; permanence declared that God&#8217;s prescribed way of approaching Him does not change (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Placed close to the rim</b><p>&#8220;They were placed close to the rim.&#8221; The rim was a border of gold that surrounded the tabletop (<a href="/exodus/37-12.htm">Exodus 37:12</a>). Positioning the rings right beneath this border accomplished two things:<p>&#8226; Stability&#8212;keeping the carrying-poles level so the holy bread would not slide (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-32.htm">1 Chronicles 9:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Visibility&#8212;making it obvious that transport was part of the table&#8217;s design, not an afterthought (<a href="/numbers/4-7.htm">Numbers 4:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>God&#8217;s people were to see that holiness must be protected whether the tabernacle was stationary or on the move (<a href="/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To serve as holders</b><p>The rings &#8220;serve as holders.&#8221; They were functional, not ornamental. Their sole purpose was to secure the poles. This underscores a scriptural pattern: God equips what He commands (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Without holders, the table could not be moved without direct contact, risking irreverence (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; By providing holders, God removed any excuse for disobedient shortcuts (<a href="/exodus/40-4.htm">Exodus 40:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the poles</b><p>The poles were acacia wood overlaid with gold (<a href="/exodus/37-15.htm">Exodus 37:15</a>). Acacia is durable; gold is glorious&#8212;together pointing to the union of humanity and divinity fulfilled perfectly in Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The poles ensured that bearers never touched the sacred table itself, keeping a clear line between holy and common (<a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a>).<p>&#8226; They allowed continual readiness to move at God&#8217;s command (<a href="/numbers/9-17.htm">Numbers 9:17&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Used to carry the table</b><p>Finally, the text states the poles were &#8220;used to carry the table.&#8221; Only Kohathite Levites could handle the poles (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). The scene pictures:<p>&#8226; Mobility&#8212;God journeys with His people, not confined to one place (<a href="/exodus/40-36.htm">Exodus 40:36&#8211;38</a>).<p>&#8226; Reverence&#8212;worship remains central even in transit; the bread of the Presence traveled untouched, just as Christ&#8217;s body saw no decay (<a href="/acts/13-35.htm">Acts 13:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Responsibility&#8212;leaders must bear the weight of ministry God&#8217;s way, not their own (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/37-14.htm">Exodus 37:14</a> highlights God&#8217;s meticulous provision for transporting the table of the bread of the Presence. The gold rings, fitted near the rim, held the poles that allowed the chosen Levites to lift the table without defilement. Every detail shows that the LORD cares about both the purity and the portability of true worship. Obedience to His precise instructions safeguards holiness, preserves fellowship, and prepares His people to move forward whenever He leads.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/37-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The rings</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1465;&#1425;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#7789;&#183;&#7789;ab&#183;b&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2885.htm">Strong's 2885: </a> </span><span class="str2">A seal, signet, a ring of any kind</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were placed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">next to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1467;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8216;um&#183;ma&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5980.htm">Strong's 5980: </a> </span><span class="str2">Society, near, beside, along with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the frame</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mis&#183;ge&#183;re&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4526.htm">Strong's 4526: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something enclosing, a margin, a stronghold</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as holders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;t&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for the poles</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(lab&#183;bad&#183;d&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_905.htm">Strong's 905: </a> </span><span class="str2">Separation, a part of the body, branch of a, tree, bar for, carrying, chief of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">used to carry</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1430;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#347;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the table.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1467;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1469;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;ul&#183;&#7717;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7979.htm">Strong's 7979: </a> </span><span class="str2">A table, a meal</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/37-14.htm">Exodus 37:14 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/37-14.htm">Exodus 37:14 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/37-14.htm">Exodus 37:14 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/37-14.htm">Exodus 37:14 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/37-14.htm">Exodus 37:14 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/37-14.htm">Exodus 37:14  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/37-14.htm">Exodus 37:14 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/37-14.htm">Exodus 37:14 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/37-14.htm">Exodus 37:14 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/37-14.htm">Exodus 37:14 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/37-14.htm">OT Law: Exodus 37:14 The rings were close by the border (Exo.
