The mention of "two sons" highlights the family unit that Moses had established during his time in Midian. This family context is significant as it shows Moses' personal life and responsibilities beyond his leadership role. The presence of his sons also emphasizes the continuation of his lineage and the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham about his descendants.<p><b>One son was named Gershom,</b><br>The name "Gershom" is derived from the Hebrew root "ger," meaning "foreigner" or "sojourner." This name reflects Moses' experience in Midian, where he lived as an outsider. Naming in biblical times often carried deep significance, reflecting personal experiences or divine encounters. Gershom's name serves as a reminder of Moses' journey and the transitional phase of his life before returning to Egypt to lead the Israelites.<p><b>for Moses had said, &#8220;I have been a foreigner in a foreign land.&#8221;</b><br>This statement encapsulates Moses' sense of identity and his experience of exile. It reflects the broader theme of the Israelites' own sojourn in Egypt and their eventual exodus. The concept of being a "foreigner" resonates with the Christian understanding of believers as "strangers and pilgrims" on earth (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land, where they would transition from foreigners to inheritors of God's promise.

Their reunion now underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness in protecting not only the nation but also the prophet&#8217;s household (see <a href="/psalms/91-9.htm">Psalm 91:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One son was named Gershom</b><p>&#8220;Gershom&#8221; sounds like &#8220;sojourner there,&#8221; pointing to Moses&#8217; exile years in Midian (<a href="/exodus/2-22.htm">Exodus 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Naming in Scripture often captures a testimony.

By reuniting the prophet with his family, Scripture spotlights God&#8217;s care for personal households even while executing grand redemptive plans.
