Acacia wood is known for its durability and resistance to decay, symbolizing the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel. The number five often represents grace in biblical numerology, suggesting the grace of God in providing a means for His presence among His people. The crossbars provided structural support, ensuring the stability of the tabernacle, which can be seen as a metaphor for the strength and support God provides to His people.<p><b>for the frames on one side of the tabernacle</b><br>The tabernacle was a portable sanctuary, reflecting the nomadic lifestyle of the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The frames and crossbars were essential for maintaining the integrity of the structure as it was assembled and disassembled. This phrase highlights the meticulous care and precision involved in the tabernacle's construction, emphasizing the importance of following God's instructions exactly. The tabernacle itself is a type of Christ, as it was the dwelling place of God's presence among His people, just as Jesus is God dwelling among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).
