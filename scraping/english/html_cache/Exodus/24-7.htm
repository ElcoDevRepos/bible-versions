The "Book of the Covenant" likely includes the laws given in <a href="/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20-23</a>. This act signifies the formalization of the covenant between God and Israel, akin to ancient Near Eastern treaties where terms were documented. The written form underscores the permanence and seriousness of the covenant.<p><b>and read it to the people,</b><br>Moses reading the Book of the Covenant to the people emphasizes the importance of hearing and understanding God's laws. In ancient Israel, oral tradition was crucial for communication and education. This public reading ensured that all Israelites were aware of the covenant's terms, highlighting the communal aspect of their relationship with God. It parallels later practices, such as the public reading of the Law in <a href="/nehemiah/8.htm">Nehemiah 8</a>.<p><b>who replied, &#8220;All that the LORD has spoken we will do,</b><br>The people's response indicates their collective commitment to obey God's commands. This mirrors the covenantal language found in other parts of the Old Testament, where the people affirm their dedication to follow God's will (e.g., <a href="/joshua/24-24.htm">Joshua 24:24</a>). Their pledge reflects a common ancient practice of vassals agreeing to the terms set by a suzerain, in this case, God as the sovereign ruler.<p><b>and we will be obedient.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration of obedience signifies the Israelites' acceptance of their role as God's chosen people, bound by His laws. It foreshadows the ongoing struggle Israel faces in maintaining faithfulness, as seen throughout the Old Testament. The phrase also points to the necessity of a mediator, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeyed God's will and established a new covenant through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who acts as the mediator between God and the people.
