The altar of burnt offering was central to Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and reconciliation with God. Acacia wood, known for its durability and resistance to decay, was commonly used in the construction of sacred objects, signifying the enduring nature of the covenant between God and His people. This altar prefigures Christ, who offered Himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>It was square, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high.</b><br>The altar's square shape, measuring approximately 7.5 feet on each side and 4.5 feet high, reflects the order and perfection associated with God's instructions. The number five often symbolizes grace in biblical numerology, suggesting the grace extended through the sacrificial system. The altar's dimensions ensured it was large enough to accommodate the sacrifices required by the Law, yet portable enough to be moved with the Israelites during their wilderness journey.
