The death of the Pharaoh marks a potential turning point in the narrative, as it often did in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where a change in leadership could lead to shifts in policy or treatment of subjugated peoples. Historically, the identity of this Pharaoh is debated, but it is generally placed within the New Kingdom period of Egypt, possibly during the reigns of Thutmose III or Ramses II. The death of a king could also symbolize the end of an era of oppression, setting the stage for divine intervention.<p><b>The Israelites groaned and cried out under their burden of slavery,</b><br>The groaning and crying out of the Israelites reflect the intense suffering and oppression they experienced. This language emphasizes the severity of their bondage and the desperation of their situation. In the cultural context, groaning and crying out were common expressions of distress and were often directed towards deities in hopes of relief. This phrase also highlights the fulfillment of God's earlier prophecy to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>, where God foretold that Abraham's descendants would be enslaved and mistreated in a foreign land.<p><b>and their cry for deliverance from bondage ascended to God.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the theological theme of God hearing the cries of His people. The idea of prayers or cries ascending to God is a common biblical motif, suggesting that God is attentive and responsive to human suffering. This sets the stage for God's intervention and the subsequent deliverance of the Israelites, which is a central theme in the book of Exodus. Theologically, this anticipates the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate deliverer, who hears the cries of humanity and provides salvation. The cry for deliverance also connects to other scriptural instances where God responds to the oppressed, such as in <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a> and <a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_egypt.htm">King of Egypt</a></b><br>The Pharaoh who had enslaved the Israelites.

The book of Judges repeats the pattern: oppression, groaning, divine rescue (<a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9, 15</a>; 6:6).<p>&#8211; God welcomes honest lament.

Between the commencement of the eighteenth and the close of the nineteenth dynasty, two kings only seem to have reigned so long as this--Thothmes III. and Rameses II. Our choice of the Pharaoh from whom Moses fled thus lies between these two.<p><span class= "bld">The children of Israel sighed.</span>--Or, "groaned." They had perhaps expected that a new king would initiate a new policy, or, at any rate, signalise his accession by a remission of burthens.

The existing oppression was such that Israel cried to God as they had never cried before, and so moved Him to have compassion on them. The miraculous action, begun in Exodus 3, is the result of the cries and groans here mentioned.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-25.</span> - DEATH OF THE PHARAOH FROM WHOM MOSES FLED - CONTINUANCE OF THE OPPRESSION OF ISRAEL-ISRAEL'S PRAYERS - GOD'S ACCEPTANCE OF THEM. - After a space of forty years from the time of Moses' flight from Egypt, according to the estimate of St. Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-30.htm">Acts 7:30</a>), which is not, however, to be strictly pressed, the king whose anger he had provoked - Rameses II., as we believe - died. He had reigned sixty-seven years - about forty-seven alone, and about twenty in conjunction with his father. At his death, the oppressed Israelites ventured to hope for some amelioration of their condition. On his accession, a king in the East often reverses the policy of his predecessor, or at any rate, to make himself popular, grants a remission of burthens for a certain period. But at this time the new monarch, Menephthah I., the son of Rameses II., disappointed the hopes of the Israelites, maintained his father's policy, continued the established system of oppression, granted them no relief of any kind. They "sighed," therefore, in consequence of their disappointment, and "cried" unto God in their trouble, and made supplication to him more earnestly, more heartily, than ever before. We need not suppose that they had previously fallen away from their faith, and "now at last returned to God after many years of idolatrous aberration" (Aben Ezra, Kalisch). But there was among them an access of religious fervour; they "turned to God" from a state of deadness, rather from one of alienation, and raised a "cry" of the kind to which he is never deaf. God therefore "heard their groaning," deigned to listen to their prayers, and commenced the course of miraculous action which issued in the Exodus. (This section is more closely connected with what follows than with what went before, and would better begin ch. 3. than terminate ch. 2.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In process of time</span>. Literally, "in those <span class="accented">many days."</span> <span class="accented">The</span> reign of Rameses II. was exceptionally long, as previously explained. He had already reigned twenty-seven years when Moses fled from him (<a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>). He had now reigned sixty-seven, and Moses was eighty! It had seemed a weary while to wait. <span class="cmt_word">The children of Israel sighed</span>. If the time had seemed a weary while to Moses, how much more to his nation! He had escaped and was in Midian - they toiled on in Egypt. He kept sheep - they had their lives made "bitter" for them "with hard bondage, in molter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field" (<a href="/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a>). He could bring up his sons in safety; their sons were still thrown into the river.
