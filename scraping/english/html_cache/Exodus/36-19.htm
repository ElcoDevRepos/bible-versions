Rams were considered valuable animals, often used in sacrifices, symbolizing substitution and atonement. The red dye likely symbolizes blood, pointing to the sacrificial system and ultimately to the blood of Christ, who is the ultimate sacrifice for sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>). The use of dyed skins also indicates the importance of the tabernacle as a holy place, set apart for God's presence among His people. The meticulous detail in the construction of the tabernacle reflects the care and reverence required in worshiping God.<p><b>and over that a covering of fine leather</b><br>The fine leather, sometimes translated as "sea cow hides" or "badger skins," served as an additional protective layer for the tabernacle. This outermost covering provided durability and protection from the elements, ensuring the tabernacle's longevity as the Israelites journeyed through the wilderness. The use of fine leather signifies the provision and care of God for His dwelling place, ensuring it was safeguarded against external threats. This layer can also be seen as a type of Christ, who covers and protects His people, providing a refuge and shelter (<a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>). The dual coverings highlight the balance of beauty and practicality in God's design, emphasizing both the spiritual and physical aspects of His covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.
