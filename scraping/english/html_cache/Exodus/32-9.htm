This divine dialogue underscores the intimate relationship Moses had with God, as seen throughout the Pentateuch. It reflects the pattern of God speaking to His chosen leaders, as He did with Abraham and later with the prophets.<p><b>I have seen this people</b><br>God's observation of the Israelites suggests His omniscience and awareness of their actions. This phrase connects to earlier instances where God "saw" the afflictions of His people in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). It emphasizes God's active involvement and concern for His covenant people, despite their rebellion.<p><b>and they are indeed a stiff-necked people</b><br>The term "stiff-necked" is a metaphor derived from agriculture, describing an animal that resists direction. It characterizes the Israelites' stubbornness and resistance to divine guidance. This description is repeated in other parts of the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/30-8.htm">2 Chronicles 30:8</a>) and serves as a warning against pride and disobedience. It foreshadows the Israelites' continued struggles with faithfulness and highlights the need for a new covenant, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers a way to transform the heart (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is speaking to Moses about the Israelites' behavior.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet of Israel, who is on Mount Sinai receiving the Law from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who have been delivered from Egypt but are now engaging in idolatry by worshiping a golden calf.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where Moses receives the Ten Commandments and where God communicates with him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_golden_calf_incident.htm">The Golden Calf Incident</a></b><br>The event where the Israelites create and worship a golden calf, demonstrating their lack of faith and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_stiff-necked_behavior.htm">Understanding Stiff-necked Behavior</a></b><br>The term "stiff-necked" (Hebrew: qesheh-oref) refers to stubbornness and an unwillingness to submit to God's authority.
