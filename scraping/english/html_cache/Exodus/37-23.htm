The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, reflecting God's creation week. The menorah's design was given directly by God to Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-40</a>), emphasizing its divine origin and purpose. The seven lamps provided light in the Holy Place, symbolizing God's presence and guidance. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/1-12.htm">Revelation 1:12-13</a>, where Jesus is depicted among seven golden lampstands, representing the churches.<p><b>its wick trimmers</b><br>Wick trimmers were essential tools for maintaining the lamps, ensuring they burned brightly and consistently. This maintenance symbolizes the need for continual spiritual vigilance and purity. Just as the priests were responsible for tending the lamps, believers are called to maintain their spiritual lives through prayer, study, and obedience. The trimming of wicks can also be seen as a metaphor for sanctification, the process of being made holy.<p><b>and trays of pure gold</b><br>The use of pure gold signifies the value and purity required in the worship of God. Gold was the most precious metal known at the time, symbolizing the divine nature and glory of God. The trays, likely used to hold the trimmings and ashes, underscore the importance of cleanliness and order in worship. This attention to detail reflects the holiness and perfection expected in the service of God. The use of gold throughout the Tabernacle points to the heavenly reality it represents, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>, where the New Jerusalem is described as being made of pure gold.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the lampstand and its accessories.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where God dwelled among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lampstand.htm">Lampstand (Menorah)</a></b><br>A significant piece of Tabernacle furniture, symbolizing the light of God and His presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_lamps.htm">Seven Lamps</a></b><br>Representing completeness and perfection, often associated with the divine presence and guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wick_trimmers_and_trays.htm">Wick Trimmers and Trays</a></b><br>Tools made of pure gold, used for maintaining the lamps, ensuring they burned brightly and continuously.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_light.htm">Symbolism of Light</a></b><br>The lampstand's light symbolizes God's presence and guidance.
