The term "foreign resident" refers to non-Israelites living among the Israelites, often without the same rights as native-born citizens. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, foreigners were vulnerable to exploitation due to their lack of familial and legal protection. This command reflects God's concern for justice and the protection of the marginalized, aligning with His character as a defender of the oppressed (<a href="/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>). The principle of treating foreigners with kindness is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to love their neighbors as themselves (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>).<p><b>for you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase serves as a reminder of Israel's own history of oppression and deliverance. The Israelites' experience in Egypt, where they were enslaved and mistreated, is a foundational narrative in their identity as God's chosen people. This historical context is meant to cultivate empathy and humility, urging them to treat others with the compassion they wished they had received. The memory of their deliverance from Egypt is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing God's power and faithfulness (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who frees humanity from the bondage of sin (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_resident.htm">Foreign Resident (Ger in Hebrew)</a></b><br>Refers to a non-Israelite living among the Israelites.

The lawgiver, however, does not say that it is to be punished capitally, nor, indeed, does he affix to it any legal penalty. Instead of so doing, he declares that God Himself will punish it "with the sword" (<a href="/exodus/22-24.htm" title="And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.">Exodus 22:24</a>). Three classes of persons particularly liable to be oppressed are selected for mention--(1) Strangers, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>foreigners; (2) widows; and (3) orphans. Strangers have seldom been protected by any legislation, unless, indeed, they formed a class of permanent residents, like the Met?ci at Athens. The law of civilised communities has generally afforded some protection to the orphan and the widow, particularly in respect of rights of property. The protection given is, however, very generally insufficient; and it is of the highest importance that it should be supplemented by an assured belief that, beyond all legal penalties there lies the Divine sentence of wrath and punishment, certain to fall upon every one who, careless of law and right, makes the stranger, the widow, or the orphan to suffer wrong at his hands.<p>(21) F<span class= "bld">or ye were strangers.</span>--Ye should, therefore, sympathise with "strangers;" not "vex them," not "oppress them," but "love them as yourselves" (<a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm" title="But the stranger that dwells with you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:34</a>). The condition of foreigners in Israel is shown to have been more than tolerable by the examples of the Kenites (<a href="/judges/1-16.htm" title="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Judges 1:16</a>; <a href="/judges/4-11.htm" title="Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.">Judges 4:11</a>); of Araunah the Jebusite (<a href="/context/2_samuel/24-18.htm" title="And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, raise an altar to the LORD in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.">2Samuel 24:18-24</a>); of Uriah the Hittite (<a href="/2_samuel/23-39.htm" title="Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.">2Samuel 23:39</a>), Zelek the Ammonite (<a href="/2_samuel/23-37.htm" title="Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armor bearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,">2Samuel 23:37</a>), and others. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="accented">Law against oppression of foreigners</span>. It may be doubted whether such a law as this was ever made in any other country. Foreigners are generally looked upon as "fair game," whom the natives of a country may ridicule and annoy at their pleasure. Native politeness gives them an exceptional position in France; but elsewhere it is the general rule to "vex" them. The Mosaic legislation protested strongly against this practice (<a href="/exodus/23-9.htm">Exodus 23:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-33.htm">Leviticus 19:33</a>), and even required the Israelites to "love the stranger who dwelt with them as <span class="accented">themselves"</span> (<a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For ye were strangers</span>.
