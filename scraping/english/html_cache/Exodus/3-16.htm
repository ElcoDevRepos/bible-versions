The elders were respected leaders and representatives of the people, often responsible for making decisions and guiding the community. This reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society, where elders held authority and were seen as wise and experienced. The gathering of elders also emphasizes the communal aspect of God's message, ensuring that it is communicated to the entire nation through their leaders.<p><b>and say to them, &#8216;The LORD, the God of your fathers&#8212;the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;</b><br>This phrase establishes continuity and covenantal faithfulness. By identifying Himself as the God of their fathers, God is reminding the Israelites of the promises made to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This connection reinforces the idea of a covenant relationship that spans generations. It also serves to reassure the Israelites of God's unchanging nature and His commitment to fulfill His promises. The mention of these patriarchs ties the current situation back to the foundational stories of Israel's identity and God's faithfulness.<p><b>has appeared to me and said:</b><br>The appearance of God to Moses is a theophany, a direct encounter with the divine. This emphasizes the authority of Moses as a prophet and leader chosen by God. The personal nature of this encounter underscores the seriousness and authenticity of the message Moses is to deliver. It also highlights the unique role of Moses as an intermediary between God and the people of Israel, a role that foreshadows the mediatory work of Christ.<p><b>I have surely attended to you</b><br>This phrase indicates God's awareness and concern for the plight of the Israelites. It reassures them that their suffering has not gone unnoticed. The use of "surely" emphasizes the certainty and intensity of God's attention. This reflects God's compassionate nature and His active involvement in the lives of His people. It also serves as a reminder of God's omniscience and His ability to intervene in human affairs.<p><b>and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.</b><br>This statement acknowledges the oppression and suffering experienced by the Israelites under Egyptian bondage. It highlights the historical context of their enslavement and the harsh conditions they endured. God's awareness of their situation is a precursor to His plan for deliverance. This also connects to the broader biblical theme of God as a deliverer and redeemer, who sees the affliction of His people and acts to bring about their salvation. The mention of Egypt serves as a reminder of the historical and geographical setting of the Exodus narrative, a pivotal event in Israel's history that foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
