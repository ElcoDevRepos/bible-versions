This encounter marks a pivotal moment in biblical history, where God commissions Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. Moses' questioning reflects his hesitance and need for assurance, a common human response when faced with a daunting task.<p><b>&#8220;Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them,</b><br>Moses anticipates the skepticism he might face from the Israelites. This reflects the historical context of the Israelites' long enslavement in Egypt, which may have led to doubts about divine intervention. Moses is concerned about his credibility and the reception of his message.<p><b>&#8216;The God of your fathers has sent me to you,&#8217;</b><br>This phrase connects the present mission to the patriarchal promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It emphasizes continuity in God's covenant relationship with Israel. The reference to "fathers" underscores the importance of ancestry and God's faithfulness to His promises.<p><b>and they ask me, &#8216;What is His name?&#8217;</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, knowing the name of a deity was crucial as it revealed the deity's character and authority. The Israelites, surrounded by Egyptian polytheism, would seek assurance that Moses' message was from the true God of their ancestors.<p><b>What should I tell them?&#8221;</b><br>Moses seeks a definitive answer to provide the Israelites with confidence in his divine commission. This question sets the stage for God's revelation of His name, "I AM WHO I AM," which signifies His eternal, self-existent nature and faithfulness. This revelation is foundational for understanding God's identity and His relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew by birth, raised in Pharaoh's palace, who fled to Midian after killing an Egyptian.

Among the Israelites hitherto God had been known only by titles, as <span class= "ital">El </span>or <span class= "ital">Elohim, </span>"the Lofty One; "<span class= "ital">Shaddai,</span>" the Powerful; "<span class= "ital">Jahveh, </span>or <span class= "ital">Jehovah, "</span>the Existent." These titles were used with some perception of their meaning; no one of them had as yet passed into a proper name. Moses, imagining that the people might have become so far Egyptianised as to be no longer content with this state of things, asks God by what name he shall speak of Him to them. Who shall he say has appeared to him?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What is his name?</span> It is not at all clear why Moses should suppose that the Israelites would ask him this question, nor does it even appear that they did ask it. Perhaps, however, he thought that, as the Egyptians used the word "god," generically, and had a special name for each particular god - as Ammon, Phthah, Ra, Mentu, Her, Osiris, and the like - when he told his people of "the God of their fathers," they would conclude that he, too, had a proper name, and would wish to know it. The Egyptians set much store by the names of their gods, which in every ease had a meaning. Ammen was "the concealed (god)," Phthah, "the revealer," Ra,"the swift," etc. Hitherto Israel's God had had no name that could be called a proper name more than any other. He had been known as "El," "The High;" "Shad-dai," "The Strong;" and "Jehovah," "The Existent;" but these terms had all been felt to be descriptive epithets, and none of them had passed as yet into a proper name. What was done at this time, by the authority of God himself, was to select from among the epithets one to be distinctly a proper name, and at the same time to explain its true meaning as something more than "The Existent" - as really "The Alone Existent" - the source of all existence. Henceforth this name, which had previously been but little used and perhaps less understood, predominated over every other, was cherished by the Jews themselves as a sacred treasure, and recognised by those around them as the proper appellation of the one and only God whom the Israelites worshipped. It is found in this sense on the Moabite stone ('Records of the Past,' vol. 11, p. 166), in the fragments of Philo-Byblius, and elsewhere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/3-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">asked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
