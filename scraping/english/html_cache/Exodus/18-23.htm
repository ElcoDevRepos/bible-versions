This advice is rooted in the wisdom literature tradition, emphasizing the importance of wise counsel (<a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>). It highlights the biblical principle of shared leadership and the necessity of seeking guidance from others, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the appointment of deacons in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-7</a>.<p><b>and God so directs you</b><br>This acknowledges the sovereignty and guidance of God in decision-making. It underscores the importance of seeking divine approval and direction in all plans, aligning with the biblical principle that human plans must be submitted to God's will (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>). This phrase also reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's leadership, where God is the ultimate authority.<p><b>then you will be able to endure</b><br>The endurance mentioned here pertains to Moses' ability to sustain his leadership role without becoming overwhelmed. This is a practical application of wisdom, ensuring that leaders do not burn out. It connects to the New Testament teaching on perseverance and the importance of running the race with endurance (<a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>).<p><b>and all these people can go home in peace.</b><br>This outcome emphasizes the communal benefit of wise leadership and delegation. The peace mentioned is not just the absence of conflict but a holistic well-being, reflecting the Hebrew concept of "shalom." It points to the ultimate peace found in Christ, who is the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), and foreshadows the peace that believers are called to live in and promote (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites, tasked with guiding them through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jethro.htm">Jethro</a></b><br>Moses' father-in-law, a Midianite priest, who visits Moses and offers him wise counsel on how to manage the burden of leadership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who have been delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness under Moses' leadership.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/midian.htm">Midian</a></b><br>The region where Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, comes from.

The phrase underlines personal responsibility&#8212;Moses must choose to act on the counsel offered. Scripture often pairs wise counsel with an active response (<a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a>; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). Moses&#8217; willingness to implement this plan mirrors later moments when leaders accept Spirit-led guidance, such as the apostles appointing seven servants in <a href="/acts/6-2.htm">Acts 6:2-4</a>. The counsel itself is grounded in God&#8217;s broader design: order, shared burden, and the good of the community.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and God so directs you</b><p>Jethro&#8217;s wisdom is not a substitute for divine authority; it is submitted to it. Every good plan must be vetted through prayerful dependence on the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>; <a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>). The words remind Moses&#8212;and us&#8212;that even sound practical advice should move forward only with God&#8217;s approval. Later, in <a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16-17</a>, God explicitly affirms a similar plan by commanding Moses to gather seventy elders, confirming that delegated leadership is indeed His will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>then you will be able to endure</b><p>Continual, solitary leadership would wear Moses down. God&#8217;s intention is not exhaustion but perseverance (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>). By sharing the load, Moses can remain strong for the long haul&#8212;just as Paul later urges Timothy to entrust truth to faithful men who can teach others also (<a href="/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1-2</a>). Endurance here is physical, emotional, and spiritual, safeguarding the leader&#8217;s capacity to hear God and guide His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all these people can go home in peace</b><p>The benefit extends beyond Moses; the entire nation enjoys quicker justice, clearer guidance, and a settled heart. Shared leadership produces peace among God&#8217;s people (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>). When burdens are rightly distributed, disputes are resolved promptly (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-16.htm">Deuteronomy 1:16-17</a>), and worship continues unhindered (<a href="/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>). True peace results when God&#8217;s order prevails in community life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/18-23.htm">Exodus 18:23</a> combines wise counsel with divine direction: Moses must accept help, submit every plan to God, and distribute responsibilities. Doing so preserves the leader, blesses the people, and manifests the peace God intends for His covenant community.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so.</span>--A reference of the entire matter to God, before any final decision was made, is plainly indicated.

He assumes that the matter will be laid by Moses before God, and God's will learnt concerning it. The entire narrative supposes that there was some established means by which the Israelite leader could refer a matter to Jehovah and obtain a decision upon it. This can scarcely have been as yet the Urim and Thummim. Probably Moses held frequent communication with Jehovah by means of waking visions. <span class="cmt_word">Thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">shalt be able to endure</span> - <span class="accented">i.e</span>., "the work will not be too much for thee - thou wilt be able to bear it." This <span class="cmt_word">people shall also go to their place in peace.</span> The "place" intended would seem to be Palestine. Keil supposes that the word "peace" is to be taken literally, and concludes from it that breaches of the peace had previously been frequent, the people having "often taken the law into their own hands on account of the delay in the judicial decision;" but this is to extract from the words more than they naturally signify. "In peace" means "cheerfully, contentedly." If the changes which he recommends are carried out, Jethro thinks that the people will make the rest of the journey to Canaan quietly and contentedly, without complaint or dissatisfaction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/18-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you follow</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
