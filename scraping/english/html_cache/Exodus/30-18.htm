Bronze, a durable metal, symbolizes judgment and purification in biblical symbolism. The basin's purpose was for the priests to wash their hands and feet before performing their duties, emphasizing the necessity of cleanliness and purity in approaching God. This act of washing prefigures the spiritual cleansing necessary for believers, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/john/13-10.htm">John 13:10</a>). The use of bronze, a common material in ancient Near Eastern cultures, reflects the practical and symbolic aspects of the Tabernacle's design.<p><b>Set it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar,</b><br>The placement of the bronze basin was strategic, situated between the Tent of Meeting (the Tabernacle itself) and the altar of burnt offering. This location highlights the transition from sacrifice to service, symbolizing the need for purification before entering God's presence. The Tent of Meeting was where God communicated with Moses, and the altar was where sacrifices were made, representing atonement and worship. This positioning underscores the importance of holiness and preparation in worship, a theme echoed in <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>, which speaks of drawing near to God with a pure heart.<p><b>and put water in it,</b><br>Water in the basin was essential for the ritual cleansing of the priests. In the arid climate of the Sinai Peninsula, water was a precious resource, further emphasizing the significance of this ritual. The act of washing with water symbolizes spiritual renewal and cleansing, a concept that carries into the New Testament with the idea of baptism (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>). The use of water for purification is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, illustrating the necessity of being cleansed from sin to serve and worship God effectively.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the Tabernacle and its furnishings from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>Also known as the Tabernacle, it was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The place where sacrifices were made to God, symbolizing atonement and worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bronze_basin.htm">The Bronze Basin</a></b><br>A vessel used for ceremonial washing, symbolizing purification and preparation for service.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron, who were responsible for performing the rituals and sacrifices in the Tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_purification.htm">Symbolism of Purification</a></b><br>The bronze basin represents the need for cleansing before approaching God.

Even those already &#8220;bathed&#8221; (saved) still need daily cleansing of their walk (<a href="/john/13-10.htm">John 13:10</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The church&#8217;s cleansing &#8220;by the washing with water through the word&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>) draws on this same imagery.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Set it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar</b><p>&#8211; Placement mattered.
