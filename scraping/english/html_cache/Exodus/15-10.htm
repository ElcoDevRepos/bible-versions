The "breath" of God is often symbolic of His power and presence. In <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, God breathes life into Adam, signifying creation and life-giving power. Here, His breath signifies judgment and deliverance. The imagery of God&#8217;s breath is also seen in <a href="/ezekiel/37-9.htm">Ezekiel 37:9-10</a>, where the breath brings life to dry bones, symbolizing restoration and renewal. This act of God blowing with His breath demonstrates His sovereignty over nature and His ability to control the elements to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and the sea covered them</b><br>This refers to the miraculous event where the Red Sea returned to its place after the Israelites had crossed on dry ground, drowning the pursuing Egyptian army. The covering of the sea is a fulfillment of God's promise to deliver His people from their oppressors (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>). The event is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, symbolizing God's protection and the finality of their liberation from slavery. Theologically, it represents the judgment of God against those who oppose His will and the salvation of His chosen people. This act is also a type of baptism, as referenced in <a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>, where Paul speaks of the Israelites being "baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea."<p><b>They sank like lead</b><br>The simile "like lead" emphasizes the sudden and complete destruction of the Egyptian forces. Lead, being a heavy metal, sinks quickly and irretrievably, illustrating the finality of God's judgment. This imagery underscores the powerlessness of the Egyptians against the might of God. The sinking of the Egyptians serves as a warning against pride and opposition to God&#8217;s plans. It also highlights the futility of human strength against divine will, as seen in other biblical narratives where God opposes the proud (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><b>in the mighty waters</b><br>The "mighty waters" refer to the Red Sea, which God used as an instrument of both salvation and judgment. The term "mighty" underscores the formidable nature of the sea, which was beyond human control but completely subject to God's command. This event is a testament to God's dominion over creation, as seen in <a href="/psalms/77-16.htm">Psalm 77:16-19</a>, where the waters are described as trembling at God's presence. The crossing of the Red Sea is a foundational event in Israel's history, often recalled in Scripture as a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/136-13.htm">Psalm 136:13-15</a>). It prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who calms the stormy seas (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>) and provides a way of salvation through His death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His power and sovereignty over creation and history by delivering the Israelites from the Egyptians.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea (Red Sea)</a></b><br>The body of water that God parted to allow the Israelites to escape from the Egyptians, and then used to destroy the pursuing Egyptian army.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The oppressors of the Israelites, who pursued them into the sea and were ultimately defeated by God's intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_the_israelites.htm">Moses and the Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's deliverance, who witnessed His mighty acts and sang this song of praise in response.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_the_exodus.htm">The Event of the Exodus</a></b><br>The broader context of this verse, where God leads the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, culminating in the crossing of the Red Sea.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God's control over nature and history is absolute.

As a strong east (southeast) wind had driven the waters of the Bitter Lakes to the north-westward, so (it would seem) their return was aided and hastened by a wind from the opposite direction, which caused the sea to "cover" the Egyptians.<p><span class= "bld">They sank as lead.</span>--Compare <a href="/exodus/15-5.htm" title="The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.">Exodus 15:5</a>. To an eye-witness, it would seem, the sudden submersion and disappearance of each warrior, as the waters closed around him, was peculiarly impressive. Each seemed to be swallowed up at once, without a struggle. This would be a natural result of the heavy armour worn by the picked warriors.<p><span class= "bld">In the mighty waters.</span>--With these words the second stanza, or strophe, closes.

The immediate cause of the return of the waters, as of their retirement, was a wind. This wind must have come from a new quarter, or its effects would not have been to bring the water back. We may reasonasbly suppose a wind to have arisen contrary to the former one, blowing from the north-west or the north, which would have driven the water of the Bitter LaMes southward, and thus produced the effect spoken cf. The effect may, or may not, have been increased by the flow of the tide in the Red Sea <span class="cmt_word">They sank as lead</span>.
