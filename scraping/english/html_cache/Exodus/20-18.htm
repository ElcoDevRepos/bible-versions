In this context, they signify God's majesty and the seriousness of the covenant being established. The Israelites' experience at Mount Sinai is a theophany, a visible manifestation of God to humankind. This event parallels other biblical instances where God's presence is accompanied by natural phenomena, such as in <a href="/psalms/18-13.htm">Psalm 18:13-14</a> and <a href="/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>, emphasizing His sovereignty and might.<p><b>the sounding of the ram&#8217;s horn</b><br>The ram's horn, or shofar, is a significant instrument in Jewish tradition, often used to signal important events or divine interventions. Its sound here marks the solemnity of the occasion and the divine authority of the law being given. The shofar is also used in other biblical contexts, such as the fall of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a> and the call to repentance in <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2:1</a>, symbolizing both judgment and redemption.<p><b>and the mountain enveloped in smoke</b><br>The smoke enveloping the mountain is reminiscent of God's presence in the form of a cloud or smoke, as seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as the pillar of cloud in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>. This imagery conveys the holiness and unapproachability of God, as well as His role as a consuming fire (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). The smoke also serves as a barrier, emphasizing the separation between the divine and the human.<p><b>they trembled and stood at a distance</b><br>The people's reaction of trembling and standing at a distance reflects their fear and reverence for God's overwhelming presence. This fear is a common response to divine encounters, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a> and <a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>, where individuals recognize their own sinfulness in the presence of a holy God. The distance they maintain underscores the need for a mediator, a role that Moses fulfills here and that ultimately points to Jesus Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel who had been led out of Egypt by Moses and were now at Mount Sinai to receive God's commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God delivered the Ten Commandments to Moses.

They felt the near contact with God to be more than they could bear. Even Moses was so deeply moved that he exclaimed, "I exceedingly fear and quake" (<a href="/hebrews/12-21.htm" title="And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)">Hebrews 12:21</a>). The people were still more afraid, and felt compelled to withdraw to a distance, beyond the sound of the terrible voice. From Deuteronomy we learn that they retired within their tents (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-30.htm" title="Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.">Deuteronomy 5:30</a>), having first sent a deputation to Moses, with a request that he would thenceforth act as their intermediary. It pleased God to assent to this proposal; and the remainder of the Law was communicated by God to Moses, and by Moses to the Israelites.<p>(18) <span class= "bld">And all the people saw the thunderings</span><p>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Perceived them.

The effect produced upon the people by the accumulated terrors of Sinai - "the thunderings and the lightnings, the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking" - the cloud, and the voice out of the cloud - was an awful and terrible fear. They could not bear the manifestation of the near presence of God; and therefore "they removed and stood afar off." It seemed to them as if, on hearing the voice of God, speaking out of the thick darkness, they must die (ver. 19). Moses, upon their expressing these feelings, comforted them with an assurance that God had shown his terrors, not for their injury, but to put his fear in their hearts (ver. 20), and allowed them to retire to a distance from the mount, while he himself "drew near unto the thick darkness where God was" (ver. 21). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people saw the thunderings</span>.
