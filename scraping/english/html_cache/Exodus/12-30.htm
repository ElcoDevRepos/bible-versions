The plague struck at midnight, a time often associated with divine intervention and judgment in the Bible. Pharaoh's rising in the night signifies a disruption of normalcy and the beginning of a pivotal moment in Israel's history. This event fulfills God's warning to Pharaoh through Moses and Aaron, demonstrating God's sovereignty over Egypt's gods and Pharaoh himself.<p><b>he and all his officials and all the Egyptians&#8212;</b><br>The inclusion of Pharaoh's officials and all Egyptians highlights the widespread impact of the plague. It was not limited to the common people but affected the entire social hierarchy, emphasizing that no one was exempt from God's judgment. This mirrors the earlier plagues, which progressively demonstrated God's power over Egypt's deities and the futility of their resistance. The collective experience of the Egyptians underscores the national scale of the calamity.<p><b>and there was loud wailing in Egypt;</b><br>The loud wailing signifies profound grief and despair. In ancient cultures, wailing was a common expression of mourning, often involving loud cries and lamentations. This intense sorrow reflects the magnitude of the loss experienced by the Egyptians. The wailing also serves as a stark contrast to the silence of the Israelites, who were spared by the blood of the Passover lamb, symbolizing God's protection and deliverance.<p><b>for there was no house without someone dead.</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of the plague's impact. Every Egyptian household experienced the death of the firstborn, fulfilling God's warning in <a href="/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4-6</a>. The death of the firstborn was particularly devastating, as the firstborn held a place of prominence and inheritance in the family. This event foreshadows the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, the firstborn of all creation, whose death brings life and deliverance to those who believe. The universality of the judgment also serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and the need for redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, who hardened his heart against God&#8217;s commands through Moses to let the Israelites go.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt who suffered the consequences of Pharaoh's hardened heart, experiencing the death of their firstborns.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_cry.htm">The Great Cry</a></b><br>A significant event marking the culmination of the ten plagues, where every Egyptian household experienced loss.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_passover.htm">The Passover</a></b><br>The event preceding this verse, where the Israelites were spared from the plague through the blood of the lamb on their doorposts.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>God&#8217;s chosen leaders who communicated His will to Pharaoh and led the Israelites out of Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Pharaoh&#8217;s refusal to heed God&#8217;s command led to devastating consequences for his people.

The verse invites us to see both the severity of sin&#8217;s penalty and the complete security that comes only through the blood of God&#8217;s chosen Lamb.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">A</span> <span class= "bld">great cry.</span>--See the comment on <a href="/exodus/11-6.htm" title="And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.">Exodus 11:6</a>. The combination of public calamity, private grief, and shocked religious fanaticism might well produce a cry "such as there was none like it, neither shall be like it any more" (<a href="/exodus/11-6.htm" title="And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.">Exodus 11:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Not a house where there was not one dead.</span> This cannot have been literally true. In half the families a daughter would have "opened the womb;" in others, the firstborn son would have been absent, or dead previously. To judge Scripture fairly, we must make allowance for the hyperbole of Oriental thought and expression, which causes the substitution of universal terms for general ones, and the absence of qualifying clauses. The meaning is that in the great majority of houses there was one dead. This may, well have been so, if we include the dependants and the <span class= "ital">animals.</span> Pet animals--dogs, cats, gazelles, and monkeys--abounded in Egyptian homes.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh rose up in the night, and all his servants</span>. This general disturbance differentiates the present visitations from that which came upon the host of Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>). Then, the calamity came with such silence and secrecy, that the deaths were not suspected until men rose to go about their various tasks in the morning Now, every household seems to have been aroused from its sleep in the night. We must suppose sharp and painful illness, terminating after a few hours in death. The disaster itself may have been one from which Egypt often suffers in the spring of the year (Kalisch); but its attacking all the firstborn and no others, and no Israelites, as well as its announcement, plainly showed it to be miraculous. <span class="cmt_word">There was a great cry</span>. See the comment on Exodus 11:6. <span class="cmt_word">For there was not a house where there was not one dead</span>. This is perhaps a slight hyperbole. There would be many families in which there was no son; and some houses might contain no male who had opened the womb. It is always to be borne in mind, that the language of Scripture - especially where exciting and tragical events are narrated - is poetical, or at the least highly rhetorical. <p> CHAPTER 12:31-36 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/12-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">During the night</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(lay&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3915.htm">Strong's 3915: </a> </span><span class="str2">A twist, night, adversity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Pharaoh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">got up&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
