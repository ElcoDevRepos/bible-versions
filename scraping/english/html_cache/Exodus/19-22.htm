The priests, though set apart for religious duties, are reminded of the need for holiness. This highlights the seriousness of approaching God, emphasizing that even those in religious office are not exempt from the need for purity. The role of priests in Israel was to mediate between God and the people, a precursor to the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who perfectly mediates the new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>must consecrate themselves</b><br>Consecration involves setting oneself apart for a sacred purpose. In the Old Testament, this often included rituals such as washing, abstaining from certain activities, and offering sacrifices. This requirement underscores the holiness of God and the need for purity when entering His presence. It reflects the broader biblical theme that God is holy and those who serve Him must also strive for holiness (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>). This anticipates the New Testament call for believers to be a "royal priesthood" and live consecrated lives (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>or the LORD will break out against them.</b><br>This phrase serves as a warning of the consequences of approaching God without proper reverence and preparation. The idea of God "breaking out" against someone is seen in other biblical instances, such as the death of Uzzah when he touched the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>). It illustrates the seriousness of God's holiness and the danger of presumption. This concept is fulfilled in the New Testament through Christ, who provides a way for believers to approach God with confidence, having been cleansed by His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>In the context of Exodus, the priests were those set apart to serve in the tabernacle and later the temple.
