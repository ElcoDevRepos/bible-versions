It immediately follows the Passover and lasts for seven days. This feast commemorates the Israelites' hasty departure from Egypt, during which they did not have time to let their bread rise. The absence of leaven symbolizes purity and separation from sin, as leaven often represents sin and corruption in Scripture (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>). This feast is a call to holiness and a reminder of God's deliverance.<p><b>For seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib,</b><br>The month of Abib, later known as Nisan, corresponds to March-April in the Gregorian calendar. It marks the beginning of the Jewish religious year. The specific timing of the feast underscores the importance of divine order and timing in worship. The number seven often signifies completeness or perfection in the Bible, indicating the fullness of the observance. This period is a time of reflection and dedication, aligning with the agricultural cycle as it coincides with the barley harvest, symbolizing new beginnings and God's provision.<p><b>you are to eat unleavened bread as I commanded you.</b><br>The command to eat unleavened bread is a direct instruction from God, emphasizing obedience and remembrance. The unleavened bread, or matzah, is a tangible reminder of the Israelites' affliction and God's swift deliverance. It serves as a physical representation of spiritual truths, encouraging believers to live in sincerity and truth. This command is reiterated in the New Testament, where unleavened bread is used in the Lord's Supper, symbolizing Christ's sinless body (<a href="/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26</a>).<p><b>For in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt.</b><br>This phrase anchors the feast in historical reality, reminding the Israelites of their liberation from slavery. The Exodus is a foundational event in Jewish history, symbolizing God's power and faithfulness. It prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who is our Passover Lamb (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). The mention of Egypt serves as a reminder of God's judgment on the oppressors and His covenant faithfulness to His people.

When Jesus celebrated this feast with His disciples (<a href="/matthew/26-17.htm">Matthew 26:17</a>), He affirmed its ongoing significance and pointed to Himself as its ultimate fulfillment (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Keep&#8221; implies intentional preparation&#8212;removing leaven, gathering family, setting aside normal routines&#8212;to remember God&#8217;s rescue and holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Seven days&#8221; stresses completeness; an entire week is set apart for focused remembrance and gratitude (<a href="/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Appointed time&#8221; shows God controls the calendar&#8212;He decides when His people gather (<a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Month of Abib&#8221; (later called Nisan) corresponds to early spring, the season of new life.

Each bite reminds Israel they departed in haste (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience is practical and bodily, not just mental.

By keeping the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the month of Abib, Israel remembers an actual deliverance, rejects the old leaven of bondage and sin, and proclaims trust in the Lord who saves. The command invites believers today to live in continual remembrance of redemption through Christ&#8212;the true Passover Lamb&#8212;purging sin, celebrating freedom, and aligning every part of life with God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep.</span>--Comp. <a href="/context/exodus/12-15.htm" title="Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.">Exodus 12:15-20</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/13-3.htm" title="And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.">Exodus 13:3-10</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-15.htm" title="You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread: (you shall eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded you, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it you came out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)">Exodus 23:15</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The month Abib.</span>--See Note on <a href="/exodus/13-4.htm" title="This day came you out in the month Abib.">Exodus 13:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep</span>.
