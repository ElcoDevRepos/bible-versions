It commemorates the Israelites' hasty departure from Egypt, during which they did not have time to let their bread rise. This command underscores the importance of obedience to God's instructions and the remembrance of His deliverance. The unleavened bread symbolizes purity and separation from sin, as leaven often represents sin in Scripture (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>).<p><b>At the appointed time in the month of Abib:</b><br>The month of Abib, later known as Nisan, marks the beginning of the Hebrew religious calendar, typically falling in March or April. This timing aligns with the spring barley harvest in Israel, symbolizing new beginnings and God's provision. The term "appointed time" indicates a divinely set schedule, emphasizing God's sovereignty over time and history.<p><b>You are to eat unleavened bread for seven days:</b><br>The seven-day duration signifies completeness and perfection in biblical numerology. Eating unleavened bread for a week serves as a reminder of the Israelites' reliance on God during their journey and the need for spiritual cleansing. This practice is a call to holiness and a break from the past life of bondage.<p><b>Because that was the month you came out of Egypt:</b><br>This phrase highlights the historical context of the Exodus, a pivotal event in Israel's history that signifies liberation from slavery and the birth of the nation. It serves as a perpetual reminder of God's faithfulness and power to save. The Exodus is a type of Christ's redemptive work, as Jesus delivers believers from the bondage of sin (<a href="/luke/9-31.htm">Luke 9:31</a>).<p><b>No one may appear before Me empty-handed:</b><br>This command reflects the principle of offering and gratitude. Worshipers are expected to bring offerings as a sign of thankfulness and acknowledgment of God's blessings. It underscores the importance of giving back to God from what He has provided, a theme echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). This requirement also points to the sacrificial system, which foreshadows Christ's ultimate sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_unleavened_bread.htm">Feast of Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, marked by eating unleavened bread for seven days.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/month_of_abib.htm">Month of Abib</a></b><br>The first month of the Hebrew calendar, corresponding to March-April, when the Israelites left Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing sin and oppression.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_command.htm">God's Command</a></b><br>The directive from God to observe the feast, emphasizing obedience and remembrance of His deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt, representing God's chosen nation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Feast of Unleavened Bread is a reminder of the importance of obeying God's commands.

At such seasons we must not "appear before God empty," we must give Him not only "the salves of our lips," but some substantial acknowledgment of His goodness towards us.
