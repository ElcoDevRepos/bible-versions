This dialogue occurs after the incident of the golden calf, highlighting Moses' intercessory role for Israel. The direct communication reflects the intimate relationship Moses had with God, akin to a friend speaking to a friend, as described earlier in the chapter.<p><b>&#8220;Look, You have been telling me,</b><br>Moses is reminding God of His previous instructions, emphasizing the ongoing conversation between them. This reflects the covenant relationship where God guides and instructs His chosen leaders. It also shows Moses' reliance on God's guidance for leadership decisions.<p><b>&#8216;Lead this people up,&#8217;</b><br>God's command to lead the Israelites to the Promised Land is central to the Exodus narrative. This journey is not just a physical relocation but a spiritual pilgrimage towards fulfilling God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The phrase underscores the responsibility placed on Moses as the mediator of God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>but You have not let me know whom You will send with me.</b><br>Moses seeks clarity on God's provision for leadership and guidance. This reflects the uncertainty and need for divine assistance in fulfilling God's commands. The mention of "whom You will send" foreshadows the role of the Angel of the LORD, a divine presence accompanying Israel, which some interpret as a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ.<p><b>Yet You have said,</b><br>Moses is holding God to His word, demonstrating faith in God's promises. This reflects the biblical principle of reminding God of His promises, a practice seen throughout Scripture as a form of prayer and intercession.<p><b>&#8216;I know you by name,</b><br>This phrase signifies a deep, personal relationship between God and Moses. In biblical terms, knowing someone by name implies an intimate understanding and acknowledgment of their character and role. It highlights Moses' unique status among the prophets and leaders of Israel.<p><b>and you have found favor in My sight.&#8217;</b><br>Finding favor in God's sight is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with righteousness and obedience. This favor is not based on merit but on God's sovereign choice and grace. It parallels the New Testament concept of grace, where believers find favor through faith in Christ. Moses' favor with God is a type of Christ, who perfectly embodies divine favor and mediates it to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

He leverages the relationship God Himself initiated&#8212;known by name, favored by grace&#8212;to seek clear, covenantal guidance. The verse reminds every believer that obedience without God&#8217;s felt presence is hollow, but when we stand on His promises, we can ask boldly and expectantly for the companionship that makes any journey possible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>MOSES OBTAINS A RENEWAL OF GOD'S PROMISE TO GO UP WITH THE PEOPLE.</span><p>(12-17) The self-humiliation of the people (<a href="/context/exodus/33-4.htm" title="And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.">Exodus 33:4-6</a>) had appeased God's anger.

After some days' "wrestling with God" in the "tent of meeting," Moses prayed to know definitely what God had determined on. "Show me thy way," he said (ver. 13) - "Whom wilt thou send with me?" To this demand, God made the gracious reply - "My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest" (ver. 14). This was satisfactory, except that it did not distinctly include the conduct of the people - it might be merely a promise to himself. So Moses (vers. 15, 16) requires a more explicit assurance, and, closely associating the people with himself, declares that he will not move a step further, unless God allows the people to find grace in his sight, and consents to "distinguish" them by "going up" with them. Then at length God yields and gives the assurance" I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken" (ver. 17) - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I will go up visibly with the people and distinguish them." (See the comment on ver. 16.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">See, thou sayest</span>.
