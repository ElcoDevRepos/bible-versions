The "three things" are generally understood to be food, clothing, and marital rights, as outlined in the preceding verses. This reflects the cultural and legal expectations of the time, where a servant, especially a female one, was to be treated with a certain level of care and dignity. The provision of these necessities was a legal requirement, ensuring the servant's well-being and protection. This can be seen as an early form of social justice within the Mosaic Law, emphasizing the importance of humane treatment.<p><b>she is free to go</b><br>This indicates the servant's right to freedom if her basic needs are not met. In the historical context, this was a significant provision, as it offered a form of protection and autonomy to a vulnerable individual. The concept of freedom here is not just physical but also social and economic, allowing the woman to leave an oppressive situation. This reflects God's concern for justice and the protection of the marginalized, a theme consistent throughout Scripture.<p><b>without monetary payment.</b><br>This clause ensures that the woman is not financially penalized for leaving, highlighting the fairness and justice embedded in the law. In ancient times, servants were often bound by financial agreements, but this provision ensures that the failure of the master to fulfill his obligations nullifies any such debts. This can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teachings on freedom and redemption, where Christ's sacrifice frees believers from the bondage of sin without cost to them. The principle of liberation without payment echoes the grace offered through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers freedom to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrew_servant_girl.htm">Hebrew Servant Girl</a></b><br>The context of this verse involves a Hebrew servant girl who has been sold into servitude, often due to poverty or debt.

God is not overlooking abuse; He is setting a clear safeguard. The &#8220;however&#8221; tells the listener, &#8220;Pay attention&#8212;this is the point where the woman&#8217;s protection becomes paramount.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He does not provide her</b><p>Failure to care is the issue. A man who has taken a female servant as a wife must actively supply for her needs. Scripture elsewhere warns, &#8220;If anyone does not provide for his own&#8230; he has denied the faith&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>). Neglect is not a minor oversight&#8212;it is a covenant breach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With these three things</b><p>Verse 10 lists the trio: food, clothing, and marital rights.<p>&#8226; Food&#8212;daily sustenance (compare <a href="/proverbs/31-15.htm">Proverbs 31:15</a>)<p>&#8226; Clothing&#8212;ongoing material care (<a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>)<p>&#8226; Marital rights&#8212;emotional and physical intimacy (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-3.htm">1 Corinthians 7:3&#8211;4</a>)<p>If any of these are withheld, the woman&#8217;s security is compromised. God&#8217;s law insists that marriage never reduces a wife to property; she remains a person worthy of provision and affection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She is free to go</b><p>Freedom is the remedy. Like the jubilee release in <a href="/leviticus/25-41.htm">Leviticus 25:41</a> or <a href="/jeremiah/34-9.htm">Jeremiah 34:9</a>, the woman is not trapped. The covenant she entered was contingent on the husband&#8217;s faithfulness; his neglect nullifies the bond, and she may depart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Without monetary payment</b><p>No ransom, no reimbursement, no strings attached&#8212;her liberation is total (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/15-18.htm">Deuteronomy 15:18</a>). The debt is on the negligent husband, not on the wronged wife. God&#8217;s justice keeps the powerless from being re-enslaved by financial hurdles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/21-11.htm">Exodus 21:11</a> insists that a husband who takes a servant-girl as a wife must treat her with full marital care. If he withholds food, clothing, or intimacy, she may walk away completely free and owing nothing. The verse upholds the woman&#8217;s dignity, demonstrates God&#8217;s heart for the vulnerable, and reinforces the principle that covenant responsibilities and personal care are inseparable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">These three</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., one of these three things: </span>(1) Espouse her himself; (2) marry her to his son; or (3) transfer her, on the terms on which he received her, to another Hebrew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If he do not these three unto her</span>.
