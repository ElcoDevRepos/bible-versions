The bells, made of gold, symbolize the sound of the priest's movement, signifying the presence and holiness of God. The pomegranates, often associated with fruitfulness and abundance, may symbolize the fruitful ministry of the priest. This combination of sound and fruitfulness can be seen as a representation of the balance between proclamation and the fruitful life expected of those who serve God.<p><b>around the lower hem of the robe</b><br>The placement of the bells and pomegranates on the hem of the robe signifies the importance of the priest's role in mediating between God and the people. The hem, being the lowest part of the garment, suggests humility and service. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the hem of a garment often represented authority and identity, which is significant for the high priest who represents the people before God.<p><b>to be worn for ministry</b><br>The robe was specifically designed for the high priest's ministry, highlighting the sacredness and set-apart nature of his duties. The priestly garments were not ordinary clothing but were consecrated for service in the tabernacle. This underscores the idea that those who serve God must be set apart and holy, reflecting the character of God in their service.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the obedience to God's specific instructions. The construction of the tabernacle and the making of the priestly garments were done according to divine command, reflecting the importance of following God's will precisely. This obedience is a recurring theme in the Pentateuch, illustrating the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It also foreshadows the perfect obedience of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the priestly garments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priestly_garments.htm">Priestly Garments</a></b><br>Special clothing worn by the priests, particularly the High Priest, when ministering in the Tabernacle.
