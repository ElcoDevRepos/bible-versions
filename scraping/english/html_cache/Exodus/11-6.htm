This event is a direct consequence of Pharaoh's hardened heart and refusal to release the Israelites. The "great cry" signifies not only the physical loss but also the spiritual and emotional devastation experienced by the Egyptians. Historically, Egypt was a powerful and prosperous nation, and such a calamity would have been unprecedented. The cry is reminiscent of the earlier cries of the Israelites under slavery, highlighting a reversal of fortunes and divine justice. This event foreshadows the ultimate deliverance of God's people and serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where deliverance from sin comes through sacrifice and judgment.<p><b>Such an outcry has never been heard before and will never be heard again.</b><br>This hyperbolic expression emphasizes the unparalleled nature of the event. It underscores the severity and uniqueness of God's judgment on Egypt, marking it as a singular moment in history. The phrase suggests that the magnitude of this divine intervention is unmatched, both in the past and future. This can be connected to the eschatological themes found in the New Testament, where final judgment and deliverance are described in similarly absolute terms. The statement also serves as a warning and a testament to God's power and sovereignty, reinforcing the idea that His actions are purposeful and definitive. The finality of the phrase points to the completeness of God's plan and the ultimate fulfillment of His promises to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

Mr. Stuart Poole heard those of the Egyptian women at Cairo, in the great cholera of 1848, at a distance of two miles (Smith's <span class= "ital">Dictionary of the Bible,</span> vol. ii., p. 888). Herodotus, describing the lamentations of the Persian soldiers at the funeral of Masistius, says that "all B?otia resounded with their clamour" (<a href="/exodus/9-24.htm" title="So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.">Exodus 9:24</a>).

The violence of Oriental emotions, and the freedom with which they are vented are well known.

With bitter mourning in every house, the "cry" might well be one, such as there had been none like before, neither would there be any like again. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/11-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then a great</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1419.htm">Strong's 1419: </a> </span><span class="str2">Great, older, insolent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cry</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;q&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6818.htm">Strong's 6818: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cry, outcry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will go out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1497;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
