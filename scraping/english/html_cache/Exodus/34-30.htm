Aaron, as the high priest and Moses' brother, represents the leadership of Israel, while "all the Israelites" indicates the entire community. This collective observation underscores the importance of Moses' role as the mediator between God and His people. The Israelites had witnessed Moses' leadership through the Exodus and the giving of the Law, and now they see a physical manifestation of his encounter with God. This moment is pivotal as it reinforces Moses' authority and the divine origin of his leadership.<p><b>and behold, his face was radiant</b><br>The radiance of Moses' face signifies the glory of God reflected through him. This transformation occurs after Moses' direct encounter with God on Mount Sinai, where he received the second set of tablets. The radiance serves as a visible sign of God's presence and approval. In biblical context, light often symbolizes purity, truth, and divine revelation. This event foreshadows the transfiguration of Jesus Christ in the New Testament, where His face also shone with divine glory (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>). The radiance of Moses' face is a type of the greater glory revealed in Christ.<p><b>And they were afraid to approach him</b><br>The fear of the Israelites reflects a common biblical theme where humans react with awe and fear in the presence of divine holiness. This fear is not merely terror but a reverent acknowledgment of God's majesty and power. The Israelites' reaction is reminiscent of their earlier fear at Mount Sinai when they heard God's voice (<a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-19</a>). It underscores the holiness of God and the seriousness of His covenant with Israel. This fear also points to the need for a mediator, which Moses fulfills, and ultimately foreshadows the perfect mediation of Jesus Christ, who bridges the gap between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is returning from Mount Sinai after speaking with God.

This unified focus underscores Moses&#8217; God-given authority (<a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7-8</a>) and the people&#8217;s recognition that something divine has happened.<p>- Scripture often records moments when God&#8217;s chosen representative draws everyone&#8217;s attention because of a fresh encounter with the LORD (<a href="/1_samuel/12-18.htm">1 Samuel 12:18</a>; <a href="/acts/7-55.htm">Acts 7:55-56</a>). Here, that attention prepares the people to receive God&#8217;s covenant terms anew.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and behold, his face was radiant</b><p>- The radiance is literal, a supernatural afterglow from speaking &#8220;face to face, as a man speaks with his friend&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>).<p>- Similar manifestations appear when Jesus is transfigured&#8212;&#8220;His face shone like the sun&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>)&#8212;and when Stephen&#8217;s face appears &#8220;like the face of an angel&#8221; (<a href="/acts/6-15.htm">Acts 6:15</a>).<p>- This brightness proclaims God&#8217;s glory, not Moses&#8217; greatness (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7-11</a>). It visually links the covenant mediator with the God of light (<a href="/psalms/104-1.htm">Psalm 104:1-2</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>).<p>- The glow also signals life: having pleaded for the people (<a href="/exodus/32-30.htm">Exodus 32:30-32</a>), Moses returns not with wrath but with grace reflected on his skin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they were afraid to approach him</b><p>- Fallen humanity instinctively recoils when exposed to unveiled holiness (<a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>).<p>- Their fear mirrors Peter&#8217;s response to Jesus: &#8220;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man&#8221; (<a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>).<p>- Moses will soon veil his face (<a href="/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33-35</a>), illustrating that a covering is needed until hearts are renewed&#8212;an image Paul connects to the veil lifted in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-12.htm">2 Corinthians 3:12-18</a>).<p>- The episode reminds us that while God desires fellowship, His glory remains awesome; reverent fear is appropriate (<a href="/hebrews/12-21.htm">Hebrews 12:21, 28</a>-29).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/34-30.htm">Exodus 34:30</a> records a real, visible radiance on Moses&#8217; face, produced by intimate communion with the LORD. The people&#8217;s awestruck fear reveals both the majesty of God&#8217;s glory and humanity&#8217;s awareness of sin.
