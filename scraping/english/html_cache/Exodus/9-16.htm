In the context of Exodus, God is speaking to Pharaoh through Moses. The raising up of Pharaoh can be understood as God's allowance of Pharaoh's position and power to fulfill a specific divine plan. This reflects the biblical theme of God using even those who oppose Him to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>. Historically, Pharaohs were considered gods in Egyptian culture, yet here, the true God asserts His control over earthly rulers.<p><b>that I might display My power to you</b><br>The display of God's power is a central theme in the Exodus narrative. The plagues, including the one described in this chapter, serve as demonstrations of God's supremacy over the Egyptian gods and nature itself. This phrase emphasizes that the events are not random but are orchestrated to reveal God's might. Theologically, this foreshadows the ultimate display of God's power in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19-20</a>.<p><b>and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth</b><br>The proclamation of God's name signifies His reputation and character being made known. In the ancient Near East, a name was more than a label; it represented one's essence and authority. The events in Egypt were meant to extend beyond the immediate context, impacting surrounding nations and future generations. This is fulfilled as the fame of the God of Israel spreads, influencing Rahab in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a> and the Gibeonites in <a href="/joshua/9-9.htm">Joshua 9:9</a>. Ultimately, this points to the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where the name of God is to be proclaimed to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart was hardened by God to demonstrate His power and sovereignty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and where God displayed His power through the plagues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plagues.htm">The Plagues</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments on Egypt, demonstrating God's power and authority over creation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The central theme of this passage, highlighting God's control over nations and rulers to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_purpose.htm">God's Sovereignty and Purpose</a></b><br>God raises leaders and nations to fulfill His divine purposes, demonstrating His ultimate control over history.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_display_of_god's_power.htm">The Display of God's Power</a></b><br>God's actions in history, such as the plagues in Egypt, serve to reveal His power and authority to all people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/proclaiming_god's_name.htm">Proclaiming God's Name</a></b><br>Believers are called to recognize and proclaim God's greatness, as His works are meant to be a testimony to the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_hardening_of_hearts.htm">The Hardening of Hearts</a></b><br>The hardening of Pharaoh's heart serves as a warning about resisting God's will and the consequences of pride and disobedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>Even in difficult circumstances, believers can trust that God is working out His purposes for His glory and our good.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_9_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 9:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_16_God_s_control_over_Pharaoh.htm">How does Exodus 9:16 demonstrate God's sovereignty over Pharaoh's actions and decisions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_raise_Pharaoh_in_Exodus_9_16.htm">What purpose does God reveal for raising Pharaoh in Exodus 9:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Exodus_9_16_to_our_lives.htm">How can we apply God's purpose in Exodus 9:16 to our own lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_do_Ex_9_16_Rom_9_17_link_God_s_power.htm">What connections exist between Exodus 9:16 and Romans 9:17 regarding God's power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_16_Trust_God_s_plan_in_trials.htm">How does Exodus 9:16 encourage us to trust God's plan in adversity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_16_God_s_control_over_events.htm">How does Exodus 9:16 demonstrate God's sovereignty over human affairs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_harden_Pharaoh_s_heart_7.htm">Why did God harden Pharaoh's heart according to Exodus 9:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_raise_Pharaoh_in_Exodus_9_16_2.htm">What is the significance of God raising Pharaoh for His purpose in Exodus 9:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/romans_9_17-18__how_is_god_just.htm">Romans 9:17&#8211;18: When God hardens hearts, how can He still hold people accountable for their actions?

The New Testament sees no conflict between divine sovereignty and human responsibility; Pharaoh still hardens his heart, yet God remains the ultimate Author of the storyline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for this very purpose</b><p>&#8226; The LORD does nothing at random (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>). Pharaoh exists in that seat of power &#8220;for this very purpose.&#8221;<p>&#8226; We often imagine purpose in terms of our plans, but Scripture consistently shows that God&#8217;s plans override and outlast ours (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Pharaoh&#8217;s wealth, armies, and stubborn will are temporarily leveraged to spotlight a larger, eternal objective.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I might display My power to you</b><p>&#8226; Each plague escalates the revelation of divine power&#8212;turning the Nile to blood, sending hail and darkness, and finally striking the firstborn (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7-12</a>).<p>&#8226; God is not merely flexing; He is proving that every Egyptian deity is powerless before Him (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel will later remember these mighty acts and trust Him at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-8.htm">Psalm 106:8</a>).
