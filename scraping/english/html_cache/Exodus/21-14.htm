The Hebrew word for "schemes" implies planning and intent, highlighting the seriousness of the crime. In ancient Israel, the intent behind an action was crucial in determining guilt and punishment. This reflects the broader biblical principle that God judges the heart and intentions (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The commandment "You shall not murder" (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>) is foundational here, emphasizing the sanctity of life. The cultural context of the time demanded strict justice to maintain social order and deter violence.<p><b>you must take him away from My altar</b><br>The altar in ancient Israel was a place of refuge, where individuals could seek asylum (<a href="/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50-53</a>). However, this provision did not apply to those guilty of intentional murder. The altar's role as a place of mercy and sacrifice is significant, yet justice prevails over sanctuary in cases of willful murder. This reflects the balance between mercy and justice in God's character. The altar's centrality in worship and community life underscores the gravity of removing someone from its protection, indicating the severity of the crime.<p><b>to be put to death</b><br>The prescribed punishment for premeditated murder is capital punishment, reflecting the principle of lex talionis, or "an eye for an eye" (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>). This principle was intended to ensure justice and proportionality in punishment. The death penalty for murder underscores the value of human life, made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus fulfills the law and emphasizes forgiveness and transformation of the heart (<a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>), yet the seriousness of sin and the need for justice remain. This passage highlights the tension between justice and mercy, a theme central to the gospel message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_who_schemes.htm">The Man Who Schemes</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who premeditates and carries out the act of murder.

In the context of ancient Israel, a neighbor would be a fellow member of the community or tribe.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The altar represents a place of worship and sanctuary.

The previous verse, <a href="/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>, had just provided protection for the manslayer who kills &#8220;unintentionally.&#8221; Here, God pivots to the opposite situation: deliberate plotting.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and acts willfully against his neighbor to kill him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Willfully&#8221; highlights moral responsibility. The offender decides to violate &#8220;You shall not murder&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;his neighbor&#8221; stresses that the victim is a fellow covenant member, echoing <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, where shedding human blood attacks the image of God.<p>&#8226; Additional clarity comes from <a href="/numbers/35-20.htm">Numbers 35:20-21</a>, where the murderer who &#8220;lies in wait&#8221; forfeits the right to refuge cities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you must take him away from My altar</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s altar was the holiest location in Israel&#8217;s camp, yet even that sanctuary cannot shield the guilty murderer. Joab tried this in <a href="/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28-31</a>, clinging to the horns of the altar, but Solomon&#8217;s agent removed him for execution, fulfilling this command.<p>&#8226; The instruction underscores God&#8217;s impartial justice: no religious ritual, title, or place can override His moral law (<a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15-17</a>; <a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Those officiating at the altar had to participate in handing over the killer, reinforcing communal responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to be put to death</b><p>&#8226; Capital punishment for murder is not optional here; it is mandated. Earlier, <a href="/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12</a> stated, &#8220;Whoever strikes a man so that he dies must surely be put to death&#8221;. Verse 14 stresses the same outcome for planned murder.<p>&#8226; The penalty protects society, upholds the sanctity of life, and acts as a deterrent (<a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33-34</a>).<p>&#8226; Mercy is abundant in Scripture, yet it never nullifies justice. While accidental killers received refuge, the murderer received justice, illustrating both facets of God&#8217;s character (<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>; <a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a> draws a sharp line between accidental killing and premeditated murder. When killing is planned and willful, no sanctuary&#8212;even God&#8217;s altar&#8212;can spare the murderer from the divinely mandated death penalty. The verse safeguards the value of human life, affirms God&#8217;s impartial justice, and reminds us that genuine worship must be joined to moral integrity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">If a man come presumptuously.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">if a man come maliciously, </span>or <span class= "ital">with premeditation. </span>(Vulg., <span class= "ital">de industria.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt take him from mine altar.</span>--Comp. <a href="/context/1_kings/2-28.htm" title="Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom.
