This sign differentiates Israel from other nations and signifies their commitment to God's laws and statutes.<p><b>for the generations to come</b><br>The observance of the Sabbath is not limited to the current generation but is intended to be a perpetual practice for all future generations of Israelites. This continuity underscores the enduring nature of God's covenant and the timeless relevance of His commandments.<p><b>so that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you</b><br>The Sabbath is a means by which the Israelites recognize and remember that it is God who sanctifies them, setting them apart as holy.

Thus a new "sign" was needed. The observance of one day in seven as a day of holy rest became henceforth the distinguishing sign, and proved effectual. It was not likely to be adopted, and in point of fact was not adopted, by any of the heathen. We find it in the latest time of the Jewish nation still regarded as the special mark and badge of a Jew (Juv. <span class= "ital">Sat. vi.</span> 159, 14:96; Mart. <span class= "ital">Epig. 4:4</span>, 50:7, &c.).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily</span>. Rosenmuller suggests, "Nevertheless." But there is no need for any change. <span class="cmt_word">It is a sign</span>. Hitherto circumcision had been the only visible "sign" that the Israelites were under a special covenant with God - his people, bound to him by special ties (<a href="/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9-14</a>; <a href="/acts/7-8.htm">Acts 7:8</a>). The adoption of circumcision by the Egyptians and other nations (Herod. 2:104) had produced the effect that this "sign" was no longer distinguishing. It might be still" a sign of profession "; but it had ceased to be "a mark of difference "; and some other mark was therefore needed. Such the observance of the sabbath by entire abstinence from servile work became. No other nation adopted it. It continued to Roman times the mark and badge of a Jew.(<span class="accented">Juv</span>. <span class="accented">Sat</span>. 6:159; 14:96). <span class="cmt_word">That ye may know</span>, etc. By keeping the sabbath day as a day of holy rest the Israelites would know - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, would realise severally in their own per sons, that God was their sanctifier.
