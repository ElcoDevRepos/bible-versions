The context is the Israelites' impatience during Moses' prolonged absence on Mount Sinai, leading them to demand a tangible god.<p><b>he built an altar before the calf</b><br>The construction of an altar signifies a formal act of worship, which in this case is directed towards the golden calf, an idol. This act is reminiscent of pagan practices in Egypt, where Aaron and the Israelites had lived for centuries. The altar's presence indicates a misguided attempt to legitimize the worship of the calf as a divine entity.<p><b>and proclaimed: &#8220;Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>Aaron's proclamation suggests a syncretism, blending the worship of Yahweh with idolatrous practices. The term "LORD" (Yahweh) is used, indicating Aaron's intention to associate the feast with the God of Israel, despite the presence of the idol. This reflects a misunderstanding of God's commandments, particularly the prohibition against idolatry (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The feast mirrors the cultural practices of surrounding nations, where feasts were common in idol worship.

Aaron was carried on from one compliance to another. He caused the mould to be made for the idol, and the gold to be melted and run into it; and now he constructed, perhaps with his own hands, an altar of rough stones or turf (<a href="/context/exodus/20-24.htm" title="An altar of earth you shall make to me, and shall sacrifice thereon your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your sheep, and your oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to you, and I will bless you.">Exodus 20:24-25</a>), and placed it directly in front of the Image, thus encouraging the offering of sacrifice to it. Perhaps he flattered himself that by heading the movement he could control it, and hinder it from becoming downright apostacy from Jehovah. In his view no doubt the calf was an emblem of Jehovah, and the worship paid it was the worship of Jehovah. Hence the festival which he proclaimed was to be "a feast to Jehovah." But how little able he was to guide events, or to hinder the worst evils of idolatry from speedily manifesting themselves, appears from <a href="/exodus/32-6.htm" title="And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.">Exodus 32:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-25.htm" title="And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked to their shame among their enemies:)">Exodus 32:25</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He built an altar before it</span>.
