The act of being "brought back" suggests Pharaoh's continued resistance and the persistence of God's messengers. Historically, this reflects the Egyptian court's protocol, where only those summoned could approach the Pharaoh. Theologically, it underscores the theme of divine persistence and human obstinacy. Moses and Aaron, as representatives of God, symbolize the prophetic role of mediating between God and humanity, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus Christ as the ultimate mediator.<p><b>&#8220;Go, worship the LORD your God,&#8221; he said.</b><br>Pharaoh's command to "Go, worship the LORD your God" reflects a momentary concession under pressure from the plagues. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) signifies the covenant name of God, emphasizing the distinct identity of the God of Israel compared to the Egyptian pantheon. This phrase highlights the central theme of worship and obedience to God, a recurring motif throughout the Bible. It foreshadows the ultimate deliverance and worship of God by all nations, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a>.<p><b>&#8220;But who exactly will be going?&#8221;</b><br>Pharaoh's question reveals his attempt to maintain control over the situation. It reflects the cultural and political context of ancient Egypt, where the Pharaoh was seen as a divine ruler with absolute authority. By questioning who will go, Pharaoh seeks to limit the Israelites' freedom and maintain his power over them. This question also sets the stage for the subsequent dialogue about the scope of Israel's liberation, highlighting the theme of complete versus partial obedience to God's commands. It points to the comprehensive nature of salvation in Christ, who offers complete freedom from sin for all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Exodus account, Moses is chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.

Pharaoh&#8217;s courtiers&#8212;terrified by the ruin&#8212;press him to send for the two brothers again (see <a href="/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording &#8220;were brought back&#8221; underscores Pharaoh&#8217;s grudging dependence on God&#8217;s servants; only Moses and Aaron can intercede with &#8220;the LORD&#8221; who alone controls the plagues (<a href="/exodus/10-16.htm">Exodus 10:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet Pharaoh&#8217;s summons does not signal repentance. Earlier he admitted, &#8220;I have sinned&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/9-27.htm">Exodus 9:27</a>), but then &#8220;hardened his heart&#8221; once relief came (<a href="/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34&#8211;35</a>). This pattern of hardness fulfills God&#8217;s prior warning (<a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3&#8211;4</a>) and highlights His sovereignty (<a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Each return trip to the palace magnifies the trustworthiness of God&#8217;s Word: every plague lands exactly as announced (<a href="/exodus/8-10.htm">Exodus 8:10, 9</a>:5), proving Scripture&#8217;s literal accuracy in recording these events.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Go, worship the LORD your God,&#8221; he said</b><p>Amazingly, the pagan king echoes the precise language God first gave Moses: &#8220;Let My people go, so that they may worship Me&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1</a>; 5:1).<p>&#8226; Pharaoh&#8217;s reluctant concession shows that &#8220;the LORD is greater than all gods&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/18-11.htm">Exodus 18:11</a>). Even Egypt&#8217;s ruler must confess the true God, though his heart remains unchanged.<p>&#8226; His words ring hollow. Earlier he promised freedom, then reneged (<a href="/exodus/8-8.htm">Exodus 8:8, 15</a>). Here again he offers a conditional release&#8212;an outward show of compliance without inward surrender, the very essence of false repentance (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, God turns Pharaoh&#8217;s lip service into an occasion for His glory. Each time Pharaoh speaks, he unwittingly testifies to the LORD&#8217;s supremacy (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;But who exactly will be going?&#8221;</b><p>Pharaoh&#8217;s follow-up question reveals his real agenda: limit obedience, keep leverage.<p>&#8226; By probing &#8220;who exactly,&#8221; he hopes to restrict the exodus to the men alone (<a href="/exodus/10-11.htm">Exodus 10:11</a>). Women, children, and flocks would stay as hostages&#8212;insurance that Israel will return.<p>&#8226; This tactic mirrors earlier compromises: &#8220;sacrifice in the land&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/8-25.htm">Exodus 8:25</a>) or &#8220;just the men go&#8221; (later in 10:11). Each partial offer falls short of God&#8217;s full demand. Selective obedience is disobedience (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s call is comprehensive: &#8220;With our young and our old we must go&#8230;with our sons and daughters&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/10-9.htm">Exodus 10:9</a>). Redemption extends to every Israelite, foreshadowing the inclusive reach of salvation in Christ (<a href="/acts/2-39.htm">Acts 2:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Pharaoh&#8217;s question also contrasts two masters. One enslaves and fragments families; the other liberates entire households for worship (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/10-8.htm">Exodus 10:8</a> captures a pivotal palace exchange. Summoned again, Moses and Aaron confront a king who parrots God&#8217;s command yet clings to control. Pharaoh&#8217;s question &#8220;Who exactly will be going?&#8221; exposes his strategy of half-obedience, while God&#8217;s servants stand firm on total surrender. The verse reminds us that Scripture records real events with precision, displays God&#8217;s unmatched authority, and calls every believer&#8212;men, women, and children alike&#8212;to wholehearted worship and uncompromised obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh.</span>--Moses and Aaron had uttered their threat, and had straightway left his presence.

Moses gives him an answer (<a href="/exodus/10-9.htm" title="And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to the LORD.">Exodus 10:9</a>) which takes away all further pretence of doubt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh</span>. Pharaoh did not condescend so far as to send for them, but he allowed his courtiers to bring them to him. And he so far took the advice of his courtiers, that he began by a general permission to the Israelites to take their departure. This concession, however, he almost immediately retracted by a question, which implied that all were not to depart. <span class="cmt_word">Who are they that shall go?</span> It seems somewhat strange that the king had not yet clearly understood what the demand made of him was.
