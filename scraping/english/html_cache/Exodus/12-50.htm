It underscores the unity and communal action of the people in following God's instructions. This obedience is significant in the context of the Passover, a pivotal event in Israelite history. The Israelites' compliance is a demonstration of faith and trust in God's deliverance, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. This collective action also prefigures the unity expected in the body of Christ, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of following divine instructions precisely. Moses and Aaron, as leaders appointed by God, serve as intermediaries between God and the people. Their role is crucial in conveying God's commands accurately. The Israelites' adherence to these commands is a testament to their faith and reverence for God's authority. This obedience is a type of Christ's perfect obedience to the Father, as seen in the Gospels (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19, 30</a>). It also reflects the broader biblical principle that blessings follow obedience to God's word (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). The meticulous observance of God's commands during the Passover foreshadows the sacrificial death of Jesus, the Lamb of God, who fulfills the ultimate deliverance from sin (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the children of Israel, who were enslaved in Egypt and are the primary recipients of God's instructions for the Passover.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel who commands the observance of the Passover as a sign of His deliverance and faithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.
