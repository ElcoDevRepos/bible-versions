It is a spontaneous outburst of praise following the miraculous deliverance at the Red Sea. Singing was a common form of worship and celebration in ancient Israel, reflecting communal joy and gratitude. This moment signifies a collective acknowledgment of God's power and faithfulness. The act of singing to the LORD underscores the importance of worship in response to divine intervention.<p><b>I will sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted:</b><br>The phrase "I will sing" indicates a personal commitment to worship, which is echoed by the entire community. The LORD being "highly exalted" emphasizes His supreme authority and power, particularly in contrast to the defeated Egyptian forces. This exaltation is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting God's sovereignty and majesty (<a href="/psalms/99-2.htm">Psalm 99:2</a>, <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>). The act of exalting God is central to the worship practices of Israel and is a model for believers' worship today.<p><b>The horse and rider He has thrown into the sea:</b><br>This line refers to the destruction of Pharaoh's army in the Red Sea, a pivotal event in Israel's history. The imagery of "horse and rider" symbolizes military strength and power, which God effortlessly overcomes. This event is a demonstration of God's deliverance and judgment, serving as a reminder of His protection over His people. It also prefigures the ultimate victory over evil through Jesus Christ, who triumphs over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>).

It bears a close resemblance to the Egyptian religious poetry, with which Moses--and probably no other Israelite of the time--would have been familiar from his early training; and it breathes the elevated tone of religious sentiment that was scarcely shared with Moses by any contemporary. The prophetic statements in the latter verses of the hymn have led some to assign to it a date later than Joshua; but the vagueness of these statements stands in a remarkable contrast with the definiteness and graphic power of the descriptive portion, and points to the time of Moses for the composition. The poetic genius shown in the composition is, no doubt, very considerable; but the statement that it transcends all later Hebrew poesy would not have been made by any critic whose judgment was not biased by his theories. The ode is distinguished from later similar compositions by greater simplicity in the language, and greater freedom in the rhythmical arrangement. There is the usual "parallelism of clauses," with its three varieties of "antithetic, synthetic, and synonymous;" but the regular cadence is interrupted with unusual frequency by triplet stanzas, and the parallelism is less exact than that of later times.<p>The ode divides itself into two portions (<a href="/context/exodus/15-1.htm" title="Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.">Exodus 15:1-12</a> and <a href="/context/exodus/15-13.htm" title="You in your mercy have led forth the people which you have redeemed: you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.">Exodus 15:13-18</a>): the first retrospective, the second prospective. Part II. has no sub-divisions; but Part I. Consists of three, or perhaps we should say of four, portions. First comes the burden, or refrain (<a href="/exodus/15-1.htm" title="Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.">Exodus 15:1</a>), which was repeated at the close of each sub-division by Miriam and her choir of women (<a href="/exodus/15-21.htm" title="And Miriam answered them, Sing you to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.">Exodus 15:21</a>). Then we have the first stanza, or strophe, reaching from <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm" title="The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.">Exodus 15:2</a> to <a href="/exodus/15-5.htm" title="The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.">Exodus 15:5</a>. Next we have stanza or strophe 2, extending from <a href="/exodus/15-6.htm" title="Your right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: your right hand, O LORD, has dashed in pieces the enemy.">Exodus 15:6</a> to <a href="/exodus/15-10.htm" title="You did blow with your wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.">Exodus 15:10</a>. After this, stanza or strophe 3, comprising <a href="/context/exodus/15-11.htm" title="Who is like to you, O LORD, among the gods? who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?">Exodus 15:11-12</a>. These shorter, and as it were tentative, efforts are followed by the grand burst of prophetic song which constitutes Part II., and extends from <a href="/exodus/15-13.htm" title="You in your mercy have led forth the people which you have redeemed: you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.">Exodus 15:13</a> to <a href="/exodus/15-18.htm" title="The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.">Exodus 15:18</a>, terminating with the sublime utterance, beyond which no thought of man can go, "The Lord shall reign for ever and ever." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-21</span> - THE SONG OF MOSES. Full of gratitude, joy, and happiness - burning with a desire to vent in devotional utterance of the most fitting kind, his intense and almost ecstatic feelings, Moses, who to his other extraordinary powers, added the sublime gift of poesy, composed, shortly after the passage, a hymn of praise, and sang it with a chorus of the people as a thanksgiving to the Almighty. The hymn itself is generally allowed to be one of transcendent beauty. Deriving probably the general outline of its form and character of its rhythm from the Egyptian poetry of the time, with which Moses had been familiar from his youth, it embodies ideas purely Hebrew, and remarkable for grandeur, simplicity, and depth. Naturally, as being the first outburst of the poetical genius of the nation, and also connected with the very commencement of the national life, it exerted the most important formative influence upon the later Hebrew poetic style, furnishing a pattern to the later lyric poets, from which they but rarely deviated. The "parallelism of the members," which from the middle of the Last century has been acknowledged to be the only real rhythmical law of Hebrew poetry, with its three forms of "synonymous, antithetic, and synthetic (or verbal) parallelism" is here found almost us distinctly marked as in any of the later compositions. At the same time, a greater lyrical freedom is observable than was afterwards practised. The song divides itself primarily into two parts: - the first (vers. 1-12) retrospective, celebrating the recent deliverance; the second (vers. 13-18) prospective, describing the effects that would flow from the deliverance in future time. The verbs indeed of the second part are at first grammatical preterites; but (as Kalisch observes) they are "according to the sense, futures" - their past form denoting only that the prophet sees the events revealed to him as though they were already accomplished. Hence, after a time, he slides into the future (ver. 16). The second part is continuous, and has no marked break: the first sub-divides into three unequal portions, each commencing with an address to Jehovah, and each terminating with a statement of the great fact, that the Egyptians were swallowed up. These three portions are: <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> vers. 2-5, "The Lord is my strength," to "They sank into the bottom as a stone." <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> vers. 6-10," Thy right hand, O Lord," to "They sank like lead in the mighty waters." <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> vers. 11-12, "Who is like unto Thee, O Lord," to "The earth swallowed them." The first verse stands separate from the whole, as an introduction, and at the same time as the refrain. Moses and a chorus of men commenced their chant with it, and probably proceeded to the end of ver. 5, when Miriam, with the Hebrew women, interposed with a repetition of the refrain (see ver. 21). The chant of the males was resumed and carried to the close of ver. 10, when again the refrain came in. It was further repeated after ver. 12; and once moral at the close of the whole "song." Similar refrains, or burdens, are found in Egyptian melodies PART I. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then sang Moses and the children of Israel</span>. It is in accordance with the general modesty of Moses, that he says nothing of the composition of the "song." No serious doubt of his authorship has ever been entertained; but the general belief rests on the improbability of there having been among the Israelites a second literary genius of the highest order, without any mention being made of him.
