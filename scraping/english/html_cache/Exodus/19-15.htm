This preparation period emphasizes the importance of the upcoming event, which is the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai. The third day is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with resurrection and revelation, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the third day (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). The Israelites are called to sanctify themselves, highlighting the holiness required to encounter God.<p><b>he said to the people.</b><br>Moses, as the mediator between God and the Israelites, conveys God's instructions to the people. This reflects the role of prophets and leaders in the Old Testament, who often served as intermediaries. The communal aspect of this command underscores the collective responsibility of the Israelites to adhere to God's covenant. It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of the Church as a community of believers.<p><b>Do not draw near to a woman.</b><br>This command is part of the broader call to ritual purity, which was necessary for the Israelites to approach God. Abstaining from sexual relations was a common practice in ancient cultures to prepare for religious ceremonies, symbolizing a focus on spiritual rather than physical concerns. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from worldly distractions when approaching God. In the New Testament, this concept is expanded to include spiritual purity and readiness for Christ's return (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to mediate the covenant at Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God gave the Law to Moses and the Israelites, a place of divine revelation and covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were being prepared to receive the Law and enter into a covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who is establishing His covenant with Israel, emphasizing His holiness and the need for His people to be consecrated.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_third_day.htm">The Third Day</a></b><br>A specific time set by God for the Israelites to be ready to meet Him, symbolizing preparation and anticipation of divine encounter.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_preparation.htm">Holiness and Preparation</a></b><br>God&#8217;s holiness requires His people to be prepared and consecrated.

Moses now passes that charge straight on.<p>&#8226;Preparation here is total&#8212;body, clothes, heart, and priorities&#8212;which echoes later moments when Israel had to ready itself for God&#8217;s mighty acts (<a href="/joshua/3-5.htm">Joshua 3:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-5.htm">2 Chronicles 29:5</a>).<p>&#8226;The &#8220;third day&#8221; marks a fixed appointment: God will descend on Sinai, His holiness visible and audible. Nothing may be casual when the Holy One draws near.<p>&#8226;This same pattern&#8212;set time, clear warning, call to purification&#8212;runs through Scripture, whether in the Passover preparations (<a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>), the re-consecration under Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3</a>), or the believer&#8217;s ongoing call to &#8220;purify himself, just as He is pure&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-3.htm">1 John 3:3</a>).<p>&#8226;The literal timeline also foreshadows later &#8220;third-day&#8221; interventions of God, climactically in Christ&#8217;s resurrection (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>), underscoring how divine appointments are certain and hope-filled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not draw near to a woman</b><p>This phrase tells married men to refrain from sexual relations during the consecration period.<p>&#8226;In the Law, sexual intimacy was good and blessed, yet temporary abstinence could be required for ceremonial purity (<a href="/leviticus/15-16.htm">Leviticus 15:16-18</a>).<p>&#8226;Moses applies that principle here so the nation approaches God with undivided attention and ritually clean bodies, much like David&#8217;s men who abstained while on holy duty (<a href="/1_samuel/21-4.htm">1 Samuel 21:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226;The emphasis is not on demeaning women but on setting aside even rightful pleasures so nothing distracts from meeting the Lord&#8212;a principle Paul cites when couples mutually pause intimacy to devote themselves to prayer (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>).<p>&#8226;The underlying lesson: holiness touches every corner of life; drawing near to God calls for conscious, disciplined separation from normal routines when He commands it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a> stitches together two practical commands that spotlight a single truth: when the living God schedules an encounter, His people must deliberately cleanse, concentrate, and consecrate themselves. Washing garments, marking a three-day countdown, and refraining from marital relations all drive home the same point&#8212;He is holy, and meeting Him is never business as usual. Those who heed this pattern today live alert, purified, and eager for the next appointed moment when the Lord will again reveal His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Come not at your wives.</span>--Comp. <a href="/context/1_samuel/21-4.htm" title="And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.">1Samuel 21:4-5</a> :<a href="/1_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="Defraud you not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.">1Corinthians 7:5</a>.
