It underscores the personal relationship and direct guidance God provided to Moses, a theme consistent throughout the Pentateuch. This divine communication is foundational for the leadership and prophetic role Moses plays in the narrative of the Exodus.<p><b>Behold, I will rain down bread from heaven for you</b><br>The promise of "bread from heaven" refers to the manna that God provided for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. This miraculous provision is a testament to God's care and sustenance. The phrase "rain down" suggests abundance and divine origin, contrasting with earthly provision. Manna is later referenced in the New Testament as a type of Christ, the true "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>), symbolizing spiritual nourishment and God's provision through Jesus.<p><b>Each day the people are to go out and gather enough for that day</b><br>This instruction emphasizes daily dependence on God, teaching the Israelites to trust in His provision. It reflects the principle of daily reliance on God, akin to the Lord's Prayer's request for "daily bread" (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>). The daily gathering also prevented hoarding, fostering a community reliant on God's faithfulness rather than human effort.<p><b>In this way I will test whether or not they will follow My instructions</b><br>The provision of manna served as a test of obedience and faith for the Israelites. This testing is a recurring theme in the wilderness narrative, where God uses circumstances to reveal the hearts of His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>). It underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands as a demonstration of faith and trust in His promises. The test also foreshadows the broader covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience is a key component of their identity as God's chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who provides for His people and tests their obedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, through whom God communicates His instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, recently delivered from Egypt, who are learning to trust and obey God in the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_sin.htm">The Wilderness of Sin</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites are journeying and where God provides manna.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/manna.htm">Manna</a></b><br>The miraculous bread from heaven that God provides to sustain the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>God is faithful to provide for our needs, often in unexpected ways.

Our first parents were tested by a positive precept in Paradise; the family of Abraham were tested by a positive precept--circumcision on the eighth day; the Israelites were tested, both in the wilderness and afterwards throughout their career as a nation, by a number of positive precepts, whereof this concerning the manna was one. Christians are tested by positive precepts with respect to common worship, prayer, and sacraments--the object being in all cases to see whether men "will walk in God's law or no." Men are very apt to prefer their own inventions to the simple rule of following at once the letter and the spirit of God's commandments.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-8.</span> - THE PROMISE OF BREAD FROM HEAVEN. When men who are in real distress make complaint, even though the tone of their complaint be not such as it ought to be, God in his mercy is wont to have compassion upon them, to "hear their mummurings," etc., and grant them some relief. But the relief is seldom of the kind which they expect, or pray for. The Israelites wished for actual bread, made of wheaten or barley flour. God gave them, not such bread, but a substitute for it. And first, before giving it, be promised that it should be given. Thus expectation was aroused; faith was exercised; the supernatural character of the relief was indicated; the power and the goodness of God, were, both of them, shown forth. And with the promise was given a law. They were on each occasion to gather no more than would suffice for the day. Thus they would continually "live by faith," taking no thought for the morrow, but trusting all to God. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bread from heaven</span>. Compare <a href="/psalms/78-24.htm">Psalm 78:24</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-15.htm">Nehemiah 9:15</a>; <a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-51</a>. The expression is of course not to be trader-stood literally. The substance was not actual bread, neither was it locally transferred from the distant region called "heaven" to the soil of the Sinaitic peninsula. But it was called "bread," because it was intended to serve instead of bread, as the main support of life during the sojourn of Israel in the wilderness; and it was said to be "from heaven," first, as descending on 'the ground out of the circumambient air; and secondly, as miraculously sent by him, whose seat is in heaven. <span class="cmt_word">The people shall gather a certain rate every day</span>. Rather "a day's supply every day," such a quantity as shall seem to each man reasonably sufficient for himself and his family. <span class="cmt_word">That I</span> <span class="cmt_word">may prove them.</span> As in Paradise God coupled with his free gift of "every tree of the garden" the positive precept, "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat," - that he might prove our first parents, whether they would obey him or not - so now he "proved" the obedience of the Israelites by a definite, positive command - they were not to gather on ordinary days more than was sufficient for the day. All life is intended as a probation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/16-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
