The act of opening the basket signifies a moment of divine intervention and providence. The basket, made of papyrus and coated with tar and pitch, was designed to protect Moses from the waters of the Nile, symbolizing God's protection over His chosen deliverer. This moment is pivotal as it sets the stage for Moses' adoption into the Egyptian royal family, which would later enable him to lead the Israelites out of bondage.<p><b>she saw the child</b><br>The sight of the child is significant as it marks the beginning of Moses' journey from a Hebrew infant to a prince of Egypt. This moment is a fulfillment of God's plan, as Moses' survival and subsequent upbringing in Pharaoh's household were crucial for the deliverance of the Israelites. The child's presence in the basket is a testament to the faith of his mother, Jochebed, who trusted God to protect her son.<p><b>and behold, the little boy was crying</b><br>The crying of the child evokes a natural human response of compassion and care. In the cultural context of ancient Egypt, crying would have been seen as a sign of vulnerability and need, prompting Pharaoh's daughter to act. This moment highlights the humanity and innocence of Moses, who, despite being a Hebrew, is shown mercy by an Egyptian princess. The cry can also be seen as a metaphor for the cries of the Israelites in bondage, which God heard and responded to through Moses.<p><b>So she had compassion on him</b><br>Pharaoh's daughter's compassion is a key turning point in the narrative. Her decision to save Moses reflects the universal value of mercy and the breaking down of ethnic barriers. This act of compassion is a precursor to the mercy God would show to His people through Moses. It also foreshadows the compassion of Christ, who would later come to save humanity from sin.<p><b>and said, &#8220;This is one of the Hebrew children.&#8221;</b><br>Recognizing Moses as a Hebrew child is significant because it acknowledges his true identity and heritage. Despite the potential danger of harboring a Hebrew child, Pharaoh's daughter chooses to protect him, indicating a divine orchestration of events. This recognition ties Moses to the covenant promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and sets the stage for his role as the deliverer of Israel. It also prefigures the way Jesus, though born into humanity, was recognized as the Son of God, destined to deliver His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh's_daughter.htm">Pharaoh's Daughter</a></b><br>The unnamed daughter of the Egyptian Pharaoh who discovers Moses in the basket.

Perhaps she suspected what she would find inside; but would it be a living or a dead child? This she could not know. She opened, and looked. It was a living babe, and it wept. At once her woman's heart, heathen as she was, went out to the child - its tears reached the common humanity that lies below all differences of race and creed - and she pitied it. "One touch of nature makes the whole world kin." <span class="cmt_word">This is one of the Hebrews' children</span>. Hebrew characteristics were perhaps stamped even upon the infant visage. Or she formed her conclusion merely from the circumstances. No Egyptian woman had any need to expose her child, or would be likely to do so; but it was just what a Hebrew mother, under the cruel circumstances of the time, might have felt herself forced to do.
