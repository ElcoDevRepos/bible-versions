The offerings are voluntary contributions from the people, reflecting their willingness to participate in God's plan. This mirrors the New Testament principle of giving, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where believers are encouraged to give cheerfully. The offerings symbolize the people's devotion and obedience to God, setting a precedent for worship and sacrifice.<p><b>gold, silver, and bronze;</b><br>These materials were highly valued in ancient times and were often used in the construction of sacred spaces. Gold, representing purity and divinity, was used extensively in the Tabernacle, particularly in the Holy of Holies. It symbolizes the divine nature of Christ, as seen in <a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13-15</a>, where Jesus is described with golden elements. Silver, often associated with redemption (<a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>), points to the atoning work of Christ, who was betrayed for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>). Bronze, known for its strength and durability, was used for the altar and other items, symbolizing judgment and endurance. This reflects the strength and steadfastness of Christ's sacrifice, as well as the judgment He bore on behalf of humanity. The use of these materials in the Tabernacle foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice and redemption found in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received instructions from God on Mount Sinai regarding the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary that God instructed Moses to build, where He would dwell among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God gave Moses the Law and the instructions for the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being who commanded the construction of the Tabernacle and provided specific instructions for its materials and design.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_precious_materials.htm">The Significance of Precious Materials</a></b><br>Gold, silver, and bronze were valuable and symbolized the worthiness of God&#8217;s dwelling place.

They had added to their wealth by the plunder of the Amalekites. Thus they possessed a considerable store of the precious metals; and there is no difficulty in supposing that they furnished the gold needed for the tabernacle without seriously impoverishing themselves.
