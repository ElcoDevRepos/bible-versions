The statute refers to the observance of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which commemorates the Israelites' exodus from Egypt. This command is a reminder of God's deliverance and faithfulness. The use of "shall" indicates a non-negotiable directive, underscoring the seriousness of maintaining this tradition as a perpetual reminder of God's covenant with His people.<p><b>at the appointed time</b><br>The phrase "appointed time" signifies a specific period set by God for the observance of this statute. It highlights the importance of divine timing and order in worship. This concept of appointed times is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>, where God establishes various feasts and holy days. It reflects the structured nature of Israelite worship and the rhythm of their religious calendar, which was designed to keep the community focused on God's acts of salvation and provision.<p><b>year after year</b><br>This phrase indicates the perpetual nature of the observance. It was not a one-time event but a continual practice meant to be passed down through generations. This annual observance served as a teaching tool for future generations, ensuring that the story of God's deliverance was not forgotten. It also points to the cyclical nature of God's covenant relationship with His people, which is renewed and remembered through regular observance. This concept of remembrance is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus institutes the Lord's Supper as a continual remembrance of His sacrifice (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.
