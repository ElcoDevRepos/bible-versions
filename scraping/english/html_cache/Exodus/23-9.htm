In ancient Israel, foreign residents, or "sojourners," were often vulnerable due to their lack of familial and social support. The Israelites are reminded not to exploit or mistreat them, aligning with the broader biblical theme of justice for the marginalized (<a href="/leviticus/19-33.htm">Leviticus 19:33-34</a>). This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to love their neighbors as themselves (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>).<p><b>since you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners</b><br>This phrase serves as a reminder of the Israelites' own history and experiences. Having lived as foreigners in Egypt, they understood the hardships and injustices that could befall those without native status. This empathetic understanding is meant to guide their treatment of others. The shared experience of being foreigners is a call to empathy and solidarity, reinforcing the idea that personal history should inform ethical behavior.<p><b>for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt</b><br>The reference to Egypt is a powerful reminder of the Israelites' past bondage and suffering. It underscores the importance of memory in shaping moral and ethical conduct. The experience in Egypt was foundational to Israel's identity and covenant relationship with God, who delivered them from oppression (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>). This historical context is a call to gratitude and humility, recognizing God's deliverance and extending that grace to others. The theme of liberation from Egypt is a type of the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who frees believers from the bondage of sin (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_resident.htm">Foreign Resident (Ger in Hebrew)</a></b><br>Refers to a non-Israelite living among the Israelites.
