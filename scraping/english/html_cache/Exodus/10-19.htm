In the biblical context, God often uses natural elements to accomplish His purposes, as seen in the plagues of Egypt. The changing of the wind signifies a divine intervention, emphasizing that the plagues were not random natural disasters but acts of God.<p><b>to a very strong west wind</b><br>The west wind is significant as it comes from the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, contrasting with the east wind that brought the locusts. This change in direction symbolizes a reversal of the plague. In the ancient Near East, winds were often seen as manifestations of divine will, and a strong wind would be understood as a powerful act of God.<p><b>that carried off the locusts</b><br>The removal of the locusts demonstrates God's control over the situation and His ability to both bring and remove judgment. Locusts were a common and devastating plague in the ancient world, often symbolizing destruction and famine. Their removal signifies relief and the possibility of restoration.<p><b>and blew them into the Red Sea</b><br>The Red Sea, or "Sea of Reeds," is a significant geographical location in the Exodus narrative. The blowing of the locusts into the sea not only removes them from the land but also foreshadows the later miraculous crossing of the Israelites. This act can be seen as a type of cleansing, removing the impurity of the plague from the land.<p><b>Not a single locust remained anywhere in Egypt</b><br>This complete removal underscores the totality of God's deliverance. It highlights the thoroughness of God's actions and His ability to restore order.

They cannot fly far without one. It often happens that a wind blows them into the sea. Pallas says, speaking of Crimean locusts in the year 1799:--"Great numbers of them were carried [from the Crimea] by northerly winds into the sea, where they perished, and were afterwards washed on shore in heaps" (<span class= "ital">Travels,</span> vol. ii., p. 424).<p><span class= "bld">The Red sea.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">the sea of weeds,</span> or <span class= "ital">of rushes.</span> The Red Sea probably acquired this name among the Hebrews from the fact that in the time of Moses its north-western recess communicated with a marshy tract, extending as far as the Bitter Lakes, and abounding in aquatic plants of a luxuriant growth. (Comp. <a href="/exodus/2-3.htm" title="And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.">Exodus 2:3</a>, where the same term designates the water-plants of the Nile.)<p><span class= "bld">There remained not one locust . . . --</span>Niebuhr says of locusts in Arabia:--"Souvent il en reste beaucoup apres le depart general" (<span class= "ital">Description de l' Arabie,</span> p. 153). But, on the other hand, there are times when the whole swarm takes its departure at once. "A wind from the south-west," says Morier, "which had brought them, so completely drove them forwards that not a vestige of them was to be seen two hours afterwards" (<span class= "ital">Second Journey,</span> p. 98).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind</span>. Literally, "a very strong sea-wind" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one which blew from the Mediterranean, and which might, therefore, so far, be north, north-west, or north-east. As it blew the locusts into the "Sea of Weeds," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Red Sea, it must have been actually a north-west wind, and so passing obliquely over Egypt, have carried the locusts in a south-easterly direction. <span class="cmt_word">Cast them into the Red Sea</span>. Literally, "the Sea of Weeds." No commentater doubts that the Red Sea is here meant. It 'seems to have received its Hebrew appellation, <span class="accented">Yam Suph</span>, "Sea of Weeds," either from the quantity of sea-weed which it throws up, or, more probably, from the fact that anciently its north-western recess was connected with a marshy tract extending from the present head of the Gulf of Suez nearly to the Bitter Lakes, in which grew abundant weeds and water-plants. <span class="cmt_word">There remained not one locust</span>. The sudden and entire departure of locusts is as remarkable as their coming. "At the hour of prime," says one writer, "they began to depart, and at midday there was not one remaining.", "A wind from the south-west," says another, "which had brought them, so completely drove them forwards that not a vestige of them was to be seen two hours afterwards" (Morier, 'Second Journey,' p. 98). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/10-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">changed the wind</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1508;&#1465;&#1448;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;ha&#774;&#183;p&#772;&#333;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
