The land referred to is Canaan, which was inhabited by various groups with different religious practices. The command to remove these inhabitants is rooted in the covenantal promise given to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>) and reiterated to Moses. The presence of these people posed a threat to the Israelites' faithfulness to God, as their practices could lead to idolatry.<p><b>lest they cause you to sin against Me</b><br>The potential for sin arises from the influence of the Canaanites' idolatrous practices. The Israelites were called to be a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), set apart for God's purposes. The warning here is about the spiritual danger of syncretism, where the worship of Yahweh could be compromised by incorporating elements of Canaanite religion. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God's people are warned against adopting the customs of surrounding nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-29.htm">Deuteronomy 12:29-31</a>).<p><b>For if you serve their gods</b><br>Serving other gods is a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The historical context shows that the Canaanites worshiped deities like Baal and Asherah, which involved practices detestable to God, including child sacrifice and ritual prostitution. The temptation to serve these gods was strong, as they were associated with fertility and prosperity, appealing to the Israelites' desire for agricultural success.<p><b>it will surely be a snare to you.</b><br>The imagery of a snare suggests a trap that leads to destruction. This metaphor is used throughout Scripture to describe the consequences of idolatry (<a href="/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/106-36.htm">Psalm 106:36</a>). The snare represents the spiritual and moral entrapment that results from turning away from God. This warning foreshadows the Israelites' future struggles with idolatry, as seen in the books of Kings and Chronicles, where the worship of foreign gods leads to their downfall and exile. Theologically, this serves as a type of Christ, who delivers believers from the bondage of sin and idolatry, offering freedom through His sacrifice (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being instructed on how to live in the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_canaanites_and_other_inhabitants.htm">The Canaanites and Other Inhabitants</a></b><br>The existing peoples in the Promised Land, whose practices and gods were contrary to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/y/yahweh.htm">Yahweh (God)</a></b><br>The one true God who commands the Israelites to remain faithful to Him and avoid idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The worship of false gods, which is a central concern in this passage as it leads to sin and separation from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_spiritual_compromise.htm">Avoiding Spiritual Compromise</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were warned against allowing pagan influences to remain, Christians today must guard against influences that lead away from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but can include anything that takes precedence over God in our lives.

What was forbidden was the co-existence of friendly but independent heathen communities with Israel within the limits of Canaan.

This law did not, of course, affect proselytes; nor was it considered to preclude the continuance in the land of the enslaved Gibeonites.
