Throughout Scripture, God is the source of wisdom and skill (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). The giving of abilities is a recurring theme, seen in figures like Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>) and the apostles (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>). It underscores the belief that all talents and gifts are ultimately from God, meant for His purposes.<p><b>both him and Oholiab</b><br>The "him" refers to Bezalel, who, along with Oholiab, was chosen for the construction of the Tabernacle. This partnership highlights the importance of collaboration in God's work. The pairing of individuals with complementary skills is a biblical pattern, seen in Moses and Aaron, and later in Paul and Barnabas.<p><b>son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan</b><br>Oholiab's lineage is significant. The tribe of Dan was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, often associated with craftsmanship and artistry (<a href="/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30</a>). This detail roots Oholiab in a specific cultural and familial context, emphasizing that God calls people from diverse backgrounds for His purposes.<p><b>the ability to teach others</b><br>This ability is crucial for the transmission of skills and knowledge. Teaching is a valued gift in the Bible, as seen in the roles of prophets, priests, and later, apostles (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>). It reflects the communal aspect of faith, where knowledge and skills are shared for the edification of the community. This also prefigures the teaching ministry of Jesus and the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where teaching is central to discipleship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman chosen by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle.
