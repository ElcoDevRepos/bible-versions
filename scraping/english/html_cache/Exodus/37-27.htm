Gold is a recurring material in the construction of the Tabernacle, symbolizing purity and divinity. The two rings are functional but also represent completeness and stability, as the number two often signifies witness and testimony in biblical numerology.<p><b>below the molding</b><br>The molding refers to the decorative band or border that adds to the aesthetic and sacred design of the altar. This detail emphasizes the care and precision in the construction of the Tabernacle's furnishings, reflecting God's instructions to Moses on Mount Sinai. The placement of the rings below the molding ensures that the poles do not interfere with the altar's design, maintaining its sanctity and beauty.<p><b>on opposite sides</b><br>This phrase indicates symmetry and balance, which are important in the design of the Tabernacle. The opposite placement ensures that the altar can be carried evenly, preventing it from tipping or being damaged. This design reflects the order and precision that God requires in worship, as seen throughout the instructions for the Tabernacle.<p><b>to hold the poles</b><br>The poles are essential for the transportation of the altar, as the Israelites were a nomadic people during their journey through the wilderness. The use of poles for carrying sacred objects is a recurring theme in the construction of the Tabernacle, ensuring that the holy items are not touched directly by human hands, preserving their sanctity.<p><b>used to carry it</b><br>The portability of the altar signifies the transient nature of the Israelites' journey and their reliance on God's guidance. This also foreshadows the future mobility of God's presence, which is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's presence among His people. The carrying of the altar by poles is a practical solution that respects the holiness of the object, ensuring it is moved with reverence and care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the altar of incense.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar_of_incense.htm">Altar of Incense</a></b><br>A sacred piece of furniture in the Tabernacle, used for burning incense as a symbol of prayer and worship ascending to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_incense.htm">Symbolism of Incense</a></b><br>The incense represents the prayers of the people, reminding us of the importance of prayer in our daily lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_reverence.htm">Holiness and Reverence</a></b><br>The construction and use of the altar of incense teach us about approaching God with reverence and purity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_detailed_instructions.htm">God's Detailed Instructions</a></b><br>The specific instructions for the Tabernacle and its furnishings show God's desire for order and obedience in worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/carrying_god's_presence.htm">Carrying God's Presence</a></b><br>The poles for carrying the altar signify the portability of God's presence, encouraging us to carry His presence in our lives wherever we go.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_37_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 37:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_37_27_Precise_obedience.htm">How does Exodus 37:27 emphasize the importance of precise obedience to God's instructions?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Altar_s_placement_God_s_presence_lesson.htm">What does the placement of the altar teach about God's presence among His people?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Altar_s_link_to_NT_worship_teachings.htm">How does the construction of the altar connect to New Testament teachings on worship?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_align_worship_with_God_s_guidance.htm">In what ways can we ensure our worship aligns with God's detailed instructions today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Altar_design_God_s_holiness_approach.htm">How does the design of the altar reflect God's holiness and our approach to Him?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Incense_altar_s_role_in_worship.htm">What is the significance of the incense altar in Exodus 37:27 for worship practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_37_27_Craftsmanship_s_role.htm">How does Exodus 37:27 reflect the importance of precise craftsmanship in religious artifacts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_gold_overlay_in_Exodus_37_27_key.htm">Why is the overlaying of gold significant in Exodus 37:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_37.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/exodus_37_10-16__source_of_timber,_gold.htm">Exodus 37:10-16: Where did they obtain enough high-quality timber and gold to construct a table so precisely, and is there archaeological evidence of such abundance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_the_incense_formula_in_exodus_historical.htm">Exodus 37:25-29: Is there any historical or extrabiblical record to confirm the special incense formula mentioned, or does it appear only in biblical tradition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_did_israelites_transport_the_altar.htm">Exodus 27:1-8: How could the Israelites feasibly construct and transport such a large bronze-covered acacia wood altar during prolonged desert wanderings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">What is the Ark of the Covenant?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Exodus 37:27 Mean</div><b>He made two gold rings</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;He made&#8221; ties Bezalel&#8217;s craftsmanship directly to the earlier divine command (<a href="/exodus/30-4.htm">Exodus 30:4</a>).
