This consistency in dimensions underscores the order and intentionality in God's instructions to Moses. The north side, like the other sides, was part of the outer court, which served as a boundary separating the sacred space from the common. This separation is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing holiness and the need for purity when approaching God (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>).<p><b>with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases</b><br>The use of twenty posts and bronze bases indicates a sturdy and durable structure. Bronze, a metal alloy of copper and tin, was known for its strength and resistance to corrosion, symbolizing judgment and endurance. The posts provided support for the linen curtains that formed the courtyard's perimeter. The number twenty, often associated with completeness in the Bible, suggests a complete and secure enclosure. The use of bronze is significant, as it is often associated with judgment and sacrifice, seen in the bronze altar where offerings were made (<a href="/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>).<p><b>The hooks and bands of the posts were silver</b><br>Silver, a precious metal, is frequently associated with redemption and atonement in biblical symbolism. The use of silver for the hooks and bands signifies the value and sanctity of the Tabernacle. Silver was also used in the redemption money for the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>), further linking it to themes of ransom and salvation. The combination of bronze and silver in the Tabernacle's construction reflects the dual themes of judgment and redemption, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who embodies both judgment and redemption for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_north_side_of_the_courtyard.htm">The North Side of the Courtyard</a></b><br>Part of the outer structure of the Tabernacle, measuring a hundred cubits long, with specific materials and design as instructed by God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who contributed materials and labor for the construction of the Tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_attention_to_detail.htm">God's Attention to Detail</a></b><br>The specific instructions for the Tabernacle's construction highlight God's concern for detail and order.
