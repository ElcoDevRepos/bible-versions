Sanctification is twofold--outward and inward. The real essential preparation for approach to God is inward sanctification; but no external command can secure this. Moses was therefore instructed to issue directions for outward purification; and it was left to the spiritual insight of the people to perceive and recognise that such purity symbolised and required internal purification as its counterpart. The external purification was to consist in three things--(1) Ablution, or washing of the person; (2) washing of clothes; and (3) abstinence from sexual intercourse (<a href="/exodus/19-15.htm" title="And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.">Exodus 19:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Let them wash their clothes.</span>--The Levitical law required the washing of clothes on many occasions (<a href="/leviticus/11-25.htm" title="And whoever bears ought of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 11:25</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-28.htm" title="And he that bears the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean to you.">Leviticus 11:28</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-40.htm" title="And he that eats of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that bears the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 11:40</a>; <a href="/leviticus/13-6.htm" title="And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.">Leviticus 13:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/13-34.htm" title="And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scale: and, behold, if the scale be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.">Leviticus 13:34</a>; <a href="/leviticus/13-58.htm" title="And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatever thing of skin it be, which you shall wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.">Leviticus 13:58</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/14-8.htm" title="And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.">Leviticus 14:8-9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/14-47.htm" title="And he that lies in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eats in the house shall wash his clothes.">Leviticus 14:47</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/15-5.htm" title="And whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:5-22</a>, &c.)

The people having accepted God's terms, the time had come for the revelation in all its fulness of the covenant which God designed to make with them. This, it was essential, they should perceive and know to come from God, and not to be the invention of Moses. God, therefore, was about to manifest himself. But ere he could do this with safety, it was requisite that certain preparations should be made. Before man can be fit to approach God, he needs to be sanctified. The essential sanctification is internal; but, as internal purity and holiness cannot be produced at a given moment, Moses was ordered to require its outward symbol, external bodily cleanliness, by ablution and the washing of clothes, as a preliminary to God's descent upon the mountain (vers. 10, 13). It would be generally understood that this external purity was symbolical only, and needed to be accompanied by internal cleanliness. Further, since even the purest of men is impure in God's sight, and since there would be many in the congregation who had attempted no internal cleansing, it was necessary to provide that they should not draw too near, so as to intrude on the holy ground or on God's presence. Moses was therefore required to have a fence erected round the mountain, between it and the people, and to proclaim the penalty of death against all who should pass it and touch the mount (vers. 12, 13). In executing these orders, Moses gave an additional charge to the heads of families, that they should purify themselves by an act of abstinence which he specified (ver. 15) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go unto the people</span>. Moses had withdrawn himself from the people to report their words to God (vers. 8, 9). He was now commanded to return to them. <span class="cmt_word">Sanctify them</span>. Or "purify them." Purification in Egypt was partly by washing, partly, by shaving the hair, either front the head only, or from the entire body (Herod. 2:37), partly perhaps by other rites. The Israelites seem ordinarily to have purified themselves by washing only. <span class="cmt_word">To-day and to-morrow</span>.
