In the context of the Exodus narrative, it underscores the idea that God's commandments are not limited to a specific ethnic group but are applicable to all who choose to follow Him. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Paul writes in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a> that there is neither Jew nor Greek, for all are one in Christ Jesus. The law serves as a unifying standard, reflecting God's impartiality and justice.<p><b>to both the native</b><br>The term "native" refers to the Israelites, the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were the original recipients of God's covenant. This highlights the continuity of God's promises to His chosen people. The Israelites were to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), and their adherence to God's law was a testament to their unique relationship with Him. The law was integral to their identity and mission as God's people.<p><b>and the foreigner who resides among you.</b><br>The inclusion of the "foreigner" or "sojourner" signifies God's inclusive nature and His concern for all humanity. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, foreigners often had limited rights and were marginalized. However, God's law provided protection and inclusion for them, reflecting His compassion and justice. This provision foreshadows the New Testament teaching that the gospel is for all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). It also points to the future gathering of all peoples into God's kingdom, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language stands before the throne of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the law from God and communicated it to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The native people of Israel, God's chosen people, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners (Sojourners)</a></b><br>Non-Israelites living among the Israelites, who were also subject to God's laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which the Israelites were delivered, representing bondage and oppression.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>The event during which God spared the Israelites from the final plague in Egypt, leading to their exodus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_god's_law.htm">Unity in God's Law</a></b><br>God's law is universal and applies equally to all people, regardless of their background.
