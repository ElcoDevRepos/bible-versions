The act of eating the sacrificial meal signifies the priests' participation in the atonement process, symbolizing their acceptance and internalization of the sacrificial atonement. The consumption of the sacrificial meal is a ritual act that completes the consecration process, setting the priests apart for their sacred duties. This practice underscores the importance of the priesthood in mediating between God and the Israelites, foreshadowing the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who offers Himself as the final atoning sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>).<p><b>But no outsider may eat them,</b><br>The restriction against outsiders consuming the sacrificial meal emphasizes the holiness and exclusivity of the priestly role. In the context of ancient Israel, "outsider" refers to anyone not belonging to the priestly family of Aaron. This separation highlights the sanctity of the priesthood and the need for purity in those who serve before God. The concept of separation from the profane is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, reflecting God's holiness and the need for His people to be set apart (<a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a>).<p><b>because these things are sacred.</b><br>The sacred nature of the sacrificial offerings underscores their role in the divine covenant between God and Israel. The term "sacred" indicates that these offerings are dedicated to God and must be treated with reverence. This sacredness is a reminder of God's holiness and the seriousness of the covenant relationship. The idea of sacredness is central to the worship practices of Israel and is fulfilled in the New Testament through the sanctifying work of Christ, who makes believers a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), set apart for God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>The primary individuals involved in this passage, Aaron and his sons, are being consecrated as priests to serve in the tabernacle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where the consecration ceremony takes place.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/consecration_ceremony.htm">Consecration Ceremony</a></b><br>A significant event where Aaron and his sons are set apart for priestly service, involving specific rituals and sacrifices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacred_offerings.htm">Sacred Offerings</a></b><br>The offerings mentioned are part of the consecration process, symbolizing atonement and sanctification.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/outsiders.htm">Outsiders</a></b><br>Refers to those not part of the priestly family or not consecrated, who are prohibited from partaking in the sacred offerings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_atonement.htm">The Importance of Atonement</a></b><br>Atonement is central to the relationship between God and His people.
