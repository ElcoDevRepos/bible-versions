In the context of the Exodus narrative, the Egyptians had multiple deities, and Pharaoh himself was considered a god. The plagues and the parting of the Red Sea were direct challenges to these beliefs, demonstrating the supremacy of the God of Israel. This revelation is not just for Israel's benefit but also serves as a witness to the surrounding nations, fulfilling God's promise to make His name known throughout the earth (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>).<p><b>when I am honored through Pharaoh</b><br>Pharaoh, as the ruler of Egypt, was a symbol of earthly power and resistance against God. God's plan to be honored through Pharaoh involves demonstrating His power over Pharaoh's stubbornness and pride. This is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God uses the actions of those who oppose Him to ultimately bring glory to His name (<a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>). The hardening of Pharaoh's heart serves as a backdrop for God's mighty acts, showing that even the most powerful human leaders are subject to God's will.<p><b>his chariots, and his horsemen.</b><br>Chariots and horsemen were symbols of military strength and technological advancement in ancient Egypt. The Egyptian army was one of the most formidable forces of the time, and their chariots were a key component of their military might. By defeating Pharaoh's chariots and horsemen, God demonstrates His power over human military strength and the futility of relying on such forces against His divine will. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over all earthly powers, as seen in prophetic literature (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>). The destruction of the Egyptian army at the Red Sea serves as a type of Christ's victory over sin and death, where what seems like defeat is turned into triumph.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt, who were oppressing the Israelites and pursuing them as they fled.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is demonstrating His power and sovereignty over Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, who hardened his heart against letting the Israelites go.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/chariots_and_horsemen.htm">Chariots and Horsemen</a></b><br>The military forces of Egypt, representing the might and power of Pharaoh's army.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea_crossing.htm">The Red Sea Crossing</a></b><br>The miraculous event where God parted the Red Sea to allow the Israelites to escape from the Egyptians.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_glory.htm">God's Sovereignty and Glory</a></b><br>God uses even the opposition of Pharaoh to demonstrate His power and glory.
