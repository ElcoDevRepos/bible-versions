This choice of "tomorrow" rather than immediate action suggests a reluctance to fully submit to God's demands. In the cultural context of ancient Egypt, Pharaoh was considered a god-king, and his hesitation underscores the struggle between the God of Israel and the gods of Egypt. This moment foreshadows the continued resistance Pharaoh will show, despite witnessing God's power.<p><b>&#8220;May it be as you say,&#8221; Moses replied,</b><br>Moses' response demonstrates his role as God's spokesperson, conveying God's will to Pharaoh. This phrase shows Moses' confidence in God's power to fulfill His promises. It also highlights the authority given to Moses, as he acts as an intermediary between God and Pharaoh. This interaction is part of the larger narrative of the plagues, which serve to demonstrate God's supremacy over Egypt's deities.<p><b>&#8220;so that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God.&#8221;</b><br>This statement emphasizes the central theme of the Exodus narrative: the uniqueness and supremacy of Yahweh. The plagues are not just acts of judgment but are designed to reveal God's power and character to both the Egyptians and the Israelites. This phrase connects to other scriptures that affirm God's uniqueness, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/4-35.htm">Deuteronomy 4:35</a> and <a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance of Israel, which serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work, showcasing God's unparalleled ability to save and deliver His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who is resistant to letting the Israelites go, despite the plagues sent by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, demonstrating His power and sovereignty over Egypt and its gods.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved and where God is displaying His power through plagues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plague_of_frogs.htm">The Plague of Frogs</a></b><br>The second plague sent by God to persuade Pharaoh to release the Israelites, demonstrating God's control over nature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of all circumstances, just as He was in control during the plagues in Egypt.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_uniqueness_of_god.htm">The Uniqueness of God</a></b><br>Understand and affirm that there is no one like the LORD our God, as demonstrated through His mighty acts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_timing.htm">Faith in God's Timing</a></b><br>Trust in God's perfect timing, as Moses did when he declared the end of the plague would be "tomorrow."<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_purpose_in_trials.htm">God's Purpose in Trials</a></b><br>See trials as opportunities for God to reveal His power and glory, as He did through the plagues.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Follow God's instructions faithfully, as Moses did, to witness His power and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_8_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 8:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_8_10_God_s_power_over_Egypt.htm">How does Exodus 8:10 demonstrate God's sovereignty over Pharaoh and Egypt's gods?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Pharaoh_s_heart_in_Exodus_8_10.htm">What does Pharaoh's response in Exodus 8:10 reveal about his heart condition?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_God_s_timing_from_Exodus_8_10.htm">How can we apply the lesson of God's timing in Exodus 8:10 today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Exodus_8_10_show_God_s_deliverance.htm">In what ways does Exodus 8:10 connect to God's deliverance throughout Scripture?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_8_10_Trust_God_s_power_timing.htm">How should Exodus 8:10 influence our trust in God's power and timing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_8_10_God_s_power_over_Egypt_2.htm">How does Exodus 8:10 demonstrate God's power over Pharaoh and Egyptian gods?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Pharaoh_resist_after_miracles_2.htm">Why did Pharaoh repeatedly harden his heart despite witnessing miracles in Exodus 8:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Moses_role_in_Exodus_8_10_s_impact.htm">What is the significance of Moses' role in Exodus 8:10 for Christian leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_8.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_swearing.htm">Why does God cause people's hearts to harden?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_moses'_speech_traits.htm">Stephen states Moses was 'mighty in words' (Acts 7:22), but Exodus 4:10 depicts Moses as slow of speech.

Earlier Moses had asked, &#8220;When shall I pray for you&#8230;?&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/8-9.htm">Exodus 8:9</a>). By saying &#8220;Tomorrow,&#8221; Pharaoh unwittingly admits that the LORD governs even Egypt&#8217;s calendar, echoing how God Himself later sets exact times for plagues (<a href="/exodus/9-5.htm">Exodus 9:5, 18</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses &#8220;tomorrow&#8221; to remind us that God alone knows and rules the future (<a href="/proverbs/27-1.htm">Proverbs 27:1</a>; <a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-15</a>). Here it highlights the contrast between human presumption and divine sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pharaoh answered.</b><p>&#8226; His response shows a fa&#231;ade of authority, yet he is trapped by circumstances only God can alter. Similar hardness is seen in <a href="/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13 and 8</a>:15.<p>&#8226; Each interaction exposes Pharaoh&#8217;s heart: &#8220;Who is the LORD, that I should obey His voice&#8230;?&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>). Though he speaks, he never truly surrenders.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>May it be as you say,</b><p>&#8226; Moses affirms that the LORD will act exactly as declared. This mirrors the confidence of Elijah before the prophets of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-37</a>) and Jesus before Lazarus&#8217; tomb (<a href="/john/11-40.htm">John 11:40-42</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores answered prayer. Moses intercedes; God responds (<a href="/exodus/8-12.htm">Exodus 8:12-13</a>). It anticipates promises like &#8220;Whatever you ask in My name, I will do&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-13.htm">John 14:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moses replied,</b><p>&#8226; Moses serves as mediator, immediately turning Pharaoh&#8217;s request into petition before God. His faithfulness fulfills God&#8217;s earlier commendation: &#8220;Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD commanded them&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/7-6.htm">Exodus 7:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern of obedience + intercession runs through Scripture&#8212;Samuel for Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/12-23.htm">1 Samuel 12:23</a>) and Christ for believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God.</b><p>&#8226; Purpose statement: the plague&#8217;s removal is not mere relief but revelation.

Every sign in Egypt dismantles a specific deity, proving the LORD alone is God (<a href="/numbers/33-4.htm">Numbers 33:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The ultimate goal is worship, not negotiation. Later, Jethro echoes this lesson: &#8220;Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/18-11.htm">Exodus 18:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Pharaoh&#8217;s choice of &#8220;tomorrow&#8221; cannot limit God; Moses&#8217; confident reply displays faith in the LORD&#8217;s precise power.
