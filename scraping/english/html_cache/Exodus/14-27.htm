The act of stretching out his hand symbolizes invoking divine power. This mirrors earlier instances where Moses used his staff to perform miracles, such as turning the Nile into blood (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>). It signifies the authority given to Moses by God to lead His people and perform wonders.<p><b>and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal state</b><br>The timing of the event at daybreak is significant, as it marks a new beginning and the fulfillment of God's promise to deliver Israel. The return of the sea to its normal state signifies the end of the miraculous path through the sea, emphasizing God's control over nature. This moment is a turning point, symbolizing the transition from slavery to freedom for the Israelites. The timing also highlights the contrast between light and darkness, often used in Scripture to represent knowledge and ignorance, salvation and judgment.<p><b>As the Egyptians were retreating</b><br>The Egyptians' retreat indicates their realization of defeat and the futility of opposing God's will. Historically, the Egyptian army was one of the most powerful military forces of the time, yet they were powerless against the divine intervention. This retreat underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and the futility of human efforts against His plans. It also serves as a warning to those who oppose God's people, illustrating the ultimate downfall of those who resist His purposes.<p><b>the LORD swept them into the sea</b><br>This phrase highlights the direct intervention of God in the deliverance of His people and the judgment of their enemies. The sweeping away of the Egyptians is reminiscent of the flood narrative in Genesis, where God judged the wickedness of humanity. It serves as a type of final judgment, foreshadowing the ultimate victory of God over evil. The destruction of the Egyptian army is a testament to God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to Israel, as well as a demonstration of His power and justice. This act of deliverance is a precursor to the salvation offered through Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from the bondage of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egyptian bondage.
