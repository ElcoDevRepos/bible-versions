The LORD, Yahweh, observes Moses' actions, highlighting God's omniscience and personal engagement with humanity. The burning bush is located on Mount Horeb, also known as Mount Sinai, a significant location for future events in Israel's history, such as the giving of the Ten Commandments. This moment marks a pivotal point in Moses' life, transitioning from a shepherd to the leader of Israel. The act of Moses turning aside to see the bush signifies his curiosity and openness to divine encounters, a necessary trait for those called by God.<p><b>God called out to him from within the bush</b><br>The voice of God emanating from the bush signifies His presence in unexpected places and forms. This theophany, or visible manifestation of God, is a unique event where God chooses to reveal Himself in a miraculous way. The bush burning yet not consumed symbolizes God's eternal nature and His ability to sustain and preserve. This calling is personal and direct, emphasizing God's desire for a relationship with Moses. The use of "God" here aligns with the Hebrew term "Elohim," denoting power and majesty.<p><b>&#8220;Moses, Moses!&#8221;</b><br>The repetition of Moses' name is a common biblical technique used to convey urgency and importance. It reflects God's intimate knowledge of Moses and His personal call to him. This double address is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>), often preceding significant divine revelations or missions. It underscores the personal nature of God's call and the importance of the task Moses is about to receive.<p><b>&#8220;Here I am,&#8221; he answered.</b><br>Moses' response indicates readiness and willingness to listen, a posture of obedience and humility. This phrase is a common biblical response to divine calls, seen in figures like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>). It reflects an attitude of servitude and openness to God's will. Moses' answer sets the stage for his commissioning as the deliverer of Israel, foreshadowing his role as a mediator between God and His people, a type of Christ who also responds to the Father's will with obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew by birth, raised in Pharaoh's palace, and now a shepherd in Midian.

Moses&#8217; inquisitive step invites divine dialogue; God&#8217;s holy presence transforms an ordinary bush into sacred ground; the double call affirms personal relationship; and Moses&#8217; ready reply models faithful obedience.
