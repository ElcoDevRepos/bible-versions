The unleavened dough symbolizes haste, as there was no time to let the dough rise. This event is commemorated in the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is a reminder of God's deliverance. The absence of leaven also represents purity and separation from sin, as leaven is often a symbol of corruption in Scripture (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>).<p><b>carrying it on their shoulders</b><br>The act of carrying the dough on their shoulders indicates the readiness and mobility required for the journey. It reflects the burden of leaving behind the familiar and stepping into the unknown, trusting in God's promise. This imagery can be seen as a precursor to the Christian call to bear one's cross and follow Christ (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>).<p><b>in kneading bowls wrapped in clothing</b><br>The kneading bowls were essential tools for daily life, signifying the practical aspects of the Israelites' preparation. Wrapping them in clothing suggests protection and care for their provisions. This detail underscores the resourcefulness and adaptability of the Israelites. It also foreshadows the provision and care God would continue to show them in the wilderness, as He provided manna and quail (Exodus 16).
