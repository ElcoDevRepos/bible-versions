In the context of Exodus, Moses expresses his insecurity about his speaking abilities, and God provides Aaron as a solution. This arrangement highlights the importance of teamwork and delegation in leadership. Aaron's role as a spokesperson is significant in the cultural context of ancient Egypt, where eloquence and the ability to communicate effectively were highly valued. This also prefigures the role of prophets in Israel, who would speak on behalf of God to the people.<p><b>He will be your spokesman,</b><br>Aaron's role as a spokesman is crucial in the unfolding narrative of the Exodus. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a spokesman or mediator was often necessary to communicate between parties of different statuses. This arrangement underscores the hierarchical structure of communication, where Aaron acts as an intermediary between Moses and the people, and ultimately between God and the people. This foreshadows the role of Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>.<p><b>and it will be as if you were God to him.</b><br>This phrase indicates the authority Moses holds in this relationship. Moses is given a God-like status in his relationship with Aaron, symbolizing the divine authority bestowed upon him. This reflects the theocratic leadership model where God communicates His will through chosen leaders. The phrase also points to the concept of divine representation, where Moses acts as God's representative on earth. This prefigures the role of Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate representation of God to humanity, as stated in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> and <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

<a href="/exodus/4-15.htm">Exodus 4:15</a> tells us, &#8220;You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth,&#8221; showing that Moses would supply the message while Aaron delivered it.<p>&#8226; We see the plan in action in <a href="/exodus/4-30.htm">Exodus 4:30</a>, where &#8220;Aaron relayed everything the LORD had told Moses.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Later, God extends the same arrangement to Pharaoh: &#8220;You must say whatever I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/7-2.htm">Exodus 7:2</a>).<p>Key idea: God&#8217;s word is never hindered by human weakness; He simply appoints another voice so His truth reaches its audience (compare <a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will be your spokesman</b><p>Aaron&#8217;s role is defined: he becomes the official herald of Moses.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a> calls Aaron &#8220;your prophet,&#8221; emphasizing a representative, not an originator, of the message.<p>&#8226; Like an ambassador who carries a ruler&#8217;s decree (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>), Aaron must stay faithful to every syllable Moses gives him.<p>&#8226; This spokesman pattern appears again when Jethro advises Moses to &#8220;be the people&#8217;s representative before God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/18-19.htm">Exodus 18:19</a>), confirming that God often works through delegated voices.<p>Takeaway: speaking for another demands accuracy, humility, and loyalty&#8212;qualities essential for anyone handling God&#8217;s word (<a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It will be as if you were God to him</b><p>Here the Lord defines a chain of authority: God &#8594; Moses &#8594; Aaron &#8594; the people.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a> the Lord repeats, &#8220;See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh,&#8221; stressing that Moses carries divine authority in both directions&#8212;toward Pharaoh and toward Aaron.<p>&#8226; The phrase does not deify Moses; it clarifies that Aaron must treat Moses&#8217; words as the very words of God, much like the Thessalonians who &#8220;accepted it not as the word of men but as the word of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; This arrangement foreshadows the ultimate Mediator: Jesus spoke only what the Father commanded (<a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49</a>), and His apostles then spoke for Him (<a href="/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>Lesson: when God appoints a messenger, respecting that messenger is part of respecting God Himself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/4-16.htm">Exodus 4:16</a> shows God solving Moses&#8217; fear of speaking by pairing him with Aaron. Moses receives the revelation; Aaron relays it. Aaron must treat Moses&#8217; instruction as divine, creating a clear flow of authority that guarantees God&#8217;s word reaches its target unhindered. The verse reminds us that God equips His servants, values accurate representation of His message, and expects His delegated voices to be heard as His own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">He shall be thy spokesman.</span>--Heb.,<span class= "ital">He shall speak for thee.</span><p><span class= "bld">He shall</span> <span class= "bld">be, even</span> <span class= "bld">he shall be.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">it shall come to pass that he shall be,</span> &c.<p><span class= "bld">Instead of God.</span>--God did not speak to Aaron directly, but only through Moses.
