Eating the meat raw or boiled would not align with the symbolism of the sacrifice. The roasting process signifies the complete and thorough judgment, akin to the consuming fire of God's holiness. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, boiling was a common method of cooking, but here it is specifically prohibited to maintain the distinctiveness of the Passover ritual. This instruction also foreshadows the sacrificial system where offerings were often burned, symbolizing purification and atonement.<p><b>but only roasted over the fire</b><br>Roasting over fire is a method that ensures the entire lamb is consumed by the flames, symbolizing the totality of the sacrifice. Fire in the Bible often represents God's presence and judgment, as seen in the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) and the pillar of fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). This method of cooking aligns with the idea of a burnt offering, which is wholly given to God. The roasting also points to the suffering and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who endured the "fire" of God's wrath for humanity's sins.<p><b>its head and legs and inner parts</b><br>The inclusion of the head, legs, and inner parts signifies the completeness of the sacrifice. Nothing is to be left out, indicating that the offering is whole and perfect. This mirrors the requirement for a lamb without blemish (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>), pointing to the sinless nature of Christ. The head represents leadership and authority, the legs symbolize the walk or journey, and the inner parts denote the heart and soul. Together, they reflect the totality of Christ's sacrifice, encompassing His mind, actions, and innermost being. This comprehensive offering underscores the thoroughness of redemption provided through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.
