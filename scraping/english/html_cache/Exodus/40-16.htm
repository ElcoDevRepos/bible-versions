This phrase highlights his obedience and dedication, which is a recurring theme in the narrative of the Exodus. Moses' actions serve as a model of faithfulness and leadership, emphasizing the importance of following divine instructions. His role as a mediator between God and the people of Israel is crucial, as he ensures that God's will is carried out among the Israelites.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded him.</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of adherence to God's specific instructions. The LORD's commands to Moses were detailed and precise, particularly concerning the construction and consecration of the Tabernacle, which is the immediate context of this verse. The Tabernacle was a portable earthly dwelling place for the divine presence, and its construction was a significant event in Israel's history, symbolizing God's presence among His people. Moses' compliance with God's commands reflects the broader biblical theme of obedience leading to blessing, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.
