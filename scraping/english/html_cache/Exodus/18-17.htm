He is a Midianite priest, which highlights the diverse cultural and religious interactions present in the biblical narrative. Jethro's advice to Moses demonstrates the importance of wisdom and counsel from others, even those outside the immediate covenant community. This interaction underscores the value of humility and the willingness to listen to others, a theme echoed in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which emphasizes the safety found in a multitude of counselors.<p><b>What you are doing</b><br>This phrase refers to Moses' method of judging the people, which involved him personally handling all disputes and issues among the Israelites. The context here is the immense burden Moses was carrying as the sole judge for the people, which was unsustainable given the large number of Israelites. This situation illustrates the need for delegation and shared leadership, a principle that is later reflected in the New Testament church structure, where elders and deacons are appointed to share the responsibilities of ministry (<a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-7</a>).<p><b>is not good.</b><br>Jethro's assessment that Moses' approach "is not good" is a direct and honest critique. This phrase highlights the importance of recognizing when a method or system is ineffective or harmful. It also points to the biblical principle that not all actions, even those with good intentions, are beneficial or wise. This echoes the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a>, which speaks to the strength and effectiveness found in partnership and collaboration. Additionally, it foreshadows the establishment of a more organized and sustainable system of governance among the Israelites, which can be seen as a type of the orderly structure within the body of Christ, where each member has a role and function (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Exodus, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

Here, the contrast prepares us for wise counsel that will spare Moses and bless Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moses&#8217; father-in-law</b><p>The counselor is Jethro, a Midianite priest who has already &#8220;heard all that God had done for Moses&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/18-1.htm">Exodus 18:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Family members can be instruments of God&#8217;s instruction (<a href="/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Jethro&#8217;s title reminds us he speaks from loving concern, not mere criticism&#8212;a pattern echoed when Naomi guides Ruth (<a href="/ruth/2-22.htm">Ruth 2:22</a>) and when Paul calls Timothy &#8220;my true son&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; His outside perspective equips him to see what Moses, immersed in work, cannot&#8212;an example of <a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>: &#8220;Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>said to him</b><p>Jethro addresses Moses directly and privately before public implementation.<p>&#8226; Scripture commends personal confrontation done in humility (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores relationship: correction travels best over the bridge of trust (<a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Moses listens&#8212;an act of meekness consistent with <a href="/numbers/12-3.htm">Numbers 12:3</a> and <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What you are doing</b><p>The focus shifts from Moses&#8217; character to his method.<p>&#8226; The job description&#8212;judging every case&#8212;was never mandated by God.

He brought forward counter-arguments. By continuing to act as hitherto, Moses would, in the first place, exhaust his own strength, and, secondly exhaust the patience of the people.
