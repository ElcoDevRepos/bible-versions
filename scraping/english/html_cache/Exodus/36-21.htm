A cubit is generally considered to be about 18 inches, making each frame approximately 15 feet long. This length indicates the grandeur and scale of the Tabernacle, which was to be a dwelling place for God's presence among His people. The use of specific measurements underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands, as seen throughout the construction of the Tabernacle. This precision can be compared to the detailed instructions given for Noah's Ark (<a href="/genesis/6-15.htm">Genesis 6:15</a>) and Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>).<p><b>and a cubit and a half wide</b><br>The width of each frame, approximately 27 inches, contributes to the stability and structure of the Tabernacle. The frames were made of acacia wood, known for its durability and resistance to decay, symbolizing the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel. The use of acacia wood and the specific dimensions highlight the care and craftsmanship involved in creating a sacred space. This attention to detail reflects the holiness and separateness of the Tabernacle, setting it apart as a place of worship and meeting with God. The dimensions also remind believers of the importance of following God's design in their own lives, as seen in the New Testament call to be living temples of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who contributed materials and labor for the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God gave Moses the instructions for the Tabernacle and the Law.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The precise dimensions of the Tabernacle frames highlight the importance of following God's instructions meticulously.
