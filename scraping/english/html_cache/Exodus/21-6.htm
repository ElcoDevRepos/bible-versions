This process ensured that the decision for a servant to remain with his master was made publicly and legally, preventing any coercion or abuse. The judges acted as representatives of God's law, emphasizing the importance of accountability and transparency. This practice reflects the broader biblical principle of justice and fairness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>, where judges are instructed to judge the people with righteous judgment.<p><b>And he shall take him to the door or doorpost</b><br>The door or doorpost holds significant symbolic meaning in biblical times. It represents the threshold of a household, a place of transition and covenant. In <a href="/exodus/12-7.htm">Exodus 12:7</a>, the Israelites marked their doorposts with the blood of the Passover lamb, signifying protection and deliverance. Similarly, the act of bringing the servant to the doorpost symbolizes a covenantal commitment, marking a transition from temporary servitude to a lifelong bond. This act also serves as a public declaration of the servant's voluntary choice to remain with his master.<p><b>and pierce his ear with an awl.</b><br>Piercing the ear with an awl was a physical sign of the servant's permanent commitment to his master. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, ear piercing was a common practice to signify belonging or allegiance. This act of piercing is reminiscent of the bond-servant relationship, where the servant willingly chooses to serve out of love and loyalty. The pierced ear becomes a visible mark of identity and dedication, much like the marks of ownership or allegiance found in other ancient cultures. This act can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>, took on the form of a servant, demonstrating ultimate obedience and submission.<p><b>Then he shall serve his master for life.</b><br>The lifelong service of the servant is a profound commitment, reflecting a deep bond between the servant and the master. This relationship is not merely transactional but is based on mutual respect and love. The concept of lifelong service can be paralleled with the New Testament teachings on servanthood and discipleship, where believers are called to serve Christ wholeheartedly and eternally. In <a href="/romans/6-22.htm">Romans 6:22</a>, Paul speaks of becoming slaves to God, resulting in sanctification and eternal life. This lifelong service is a picture of the believer's eternal commitment to Christ, who is the ultimate Master.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>The individual who owns the servant and is responsible for bringing him to God and performing the ear-piercing ritual.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>A Hebrew servant who, after serving six years, chooses to remain with his master permanently.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine authority before whom the servant's decision is affirmed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_door_or_doorpost.htm">The Door or Doorpost</a></b><br>The physical location where the servant's ear is pierced, symbolizing his permanent commitment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_awl.htm">The Awl</a></b><br>A tool used to pierce the servant's ear, marking his lifelong service.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/voluntary_servitude_as_a_model_of_commitment.htm">Voluntary Servitude as a Model of Commitment</a></b><br>The servant's choice to remain with his master is a powerful example of voluntary commitment and loyalty.

The State must sanction the passing of a citizen into the slave condition, and so the "judges" were called in. The change was to be made by a significant ceremony. In order to mark that henceforth the volunteer bondman became attached to the household, he was to be physically attached to the house by having an awl forced through his ear, and then driven into the door or door-post. Hence "opening the ear" became a synonym for assigning a man to the slave condition in perpetuity (<a href="/psalms/40-6.htm" title="Sacrifice and offering you did not desire; my ears have you opened: burnt offering and sin offering have you not required.">Psalm 40:6</a>).
