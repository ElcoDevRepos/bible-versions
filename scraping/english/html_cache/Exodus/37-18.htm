The six branches extending from the central shaft represent the completeness and perfection of God's creation, as the number six often symbolizes in biblical numerology. The menorah itself is a symbol of light, representing God's presence and guidance. The design reflects the tree of life, a motif that appears throughout Scripture, symbolizing life and sustenance provided by God. The menorah's branches are crafted from a single piece of gold, emphasizing unity and the divine craftsmanship involved in its creation.<p><b>Three on one side and three on the other</b><br>The symmetrical design of the menorah, with three branches on each side, highlights balance and order, reflecting God's nature as a God of order and harmony. This structure can also be seen as a representation of the balance between the spiritual and physical realms, with the central shaft symbolizing the divine connection between heaven and earth. The menorah's design is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus refers to Himself as the light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), drawing a parallel between the menorah's light and His role as the spiritual light guiding humanity. The menorah's presence in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple underscores its importance in Jewish worship and its enduring symbol of God's eternal light and presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the lampstand.

Jesus later affirms the same principle: &#8220;You are the light of the world&#8230; let your light shine&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; In the tabernacle, priests tended these branches so the flame never went out (<a href="/leviticus/24-2.htm">Leviticus 24:2-4</a>). Likewise, believers are called to &#8220;shine like stars in the world&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>), tending the witness God entrusts to us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the sides</b><p>&#8226; Each branch sprang from the lampstand&#8217;s central stem, showing unity of source. All illumination ultimately comes from the LORD, not from separate, competing lights (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This unity foreshadows the oneness of Christ and His people: &#8220;If the root is holy, so are the branches&#8221; (<a href="/romans/11-16.htm">Romans 11:16-18</a>). Connection to the center is essential; cut off, a branch is useless (<a href="/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>three on one side</b><p>&#8226; The equal grouping of three branches speaks of balance and order. God is not random in His worship design (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33, 40</a>).<p>&#8226; Three also resonates with patterns elsewhere&#8212;three daily sacrifices (<a href="/numbers/28-4.htm">Numbers 28:4</a>), three pilgrim feasts (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>).
