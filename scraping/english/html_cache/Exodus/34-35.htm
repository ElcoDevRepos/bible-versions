The radiance of Moses' face signifies the glory of God reflected upon him, a result of his intimate communion with the LORD on Mount Sinai. This radiance serves as a testament to the divine authority and authenticity of Moses' leadership and the commandments he received. The Israelites' ability to see this radiance underscores the tangible impact of God's presence. This event parallels the transfiguration of Jesus in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>), where His face shone like the sun, symbolizing divine glory and authority.<p><b>So Moses would put the veil back over his face</b><br>The use of a veil by Moses indicates a separation between the divine glory and the people, emphasizing the holiness of God and the need for mediation. The veil serves as a protective measure for the Israelites, who were not able to directly behold the glory of God. This act foreshadows the role of Christ as the mediator between God and humanity, as described in <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>. The veil also symbolizes the limitations of the Old Covenant, which is later contrasted with the New Covenant in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-13.htm">2 Corinthians 3:13-16</a>, where Paul explains that in Christ, the veil is removed, allowing believers to behold the glory of the Lord with unveiled faces.<p><b>until he went in to speak with the LORD.</b><br>This phrase indicates the ongoing relationship and communication between Moses and God. It highlights the unique role of Moses as a prophet and leader who had direct access to God, serving as an intermediary for the Israelites. The act of removing the veil when speaking with the LORD signifies the openness and intimacy of Moses' relationship with God, contrasting with the veiled interactions with the people. This direct communication is a precursor to the New Covenant, where believers have direct access to God through Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>, which encourages believers to approach the throne of grace with confidence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the mediator between God and His people.
