Gold is a recurring symbol of divine presence and glory throughout the Bible, as seen in the construction of the Ark of the Covenant and Solomon's Temple. The bells served a practical purpose, as they would sound when the high priest moved, signifying his presence and activity within the Holy Place. This can be connected to the idea of God's presence being announced, similar to how the sound of a trumpet is used in other parts of Scripture to signify divine intervention or revelation (e.g., <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>).<p><b>and attached them around the hem</b><br>The hem of the priestly garment was significant, as it represented the boundary between the sacred and the profane. The attachment of the bells to the hem indicates the importance of the high priest's role in mediating between God and the people. The hem's decoration with bells and pomegranates highlights the beauty and intricacy of the priestly garments, as described in <a href="/exodus/28-33.htm">Exodus 28:33-34</a>. This attention to detail underscores the reverence and care required in approaching God, a theme that is echoed in the New Testament with the call for believers to approach God with reverence and awe (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<p><b>between the pomegranates</b><br>Pomegranates are a symbol of fruitfulness and abundance, often associated with the Promised Land (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>). Their inclusion in the priestly garments may symbolize the blessings and life that come from a relationship with God. The alternating pattern of bells and pomegranates could represent the balance between the proclamation of God's presence (bells) and the fruitfulness of living in accordance with His will (pomegranates). This imagery can be seen as a type of Christ, who is both the Word of God (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>) and the source of spiritual fruitfulness (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were given the task of constructing the Tabernacle and its furnishings according to God's specific instructions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its sacred garments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priestly_garments.htm">Priestly Garments</a></b><br>Sacred clothing worn by the priests, particularly the High Priest, when ministering in the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pomegranates_and_bells.htm">Pomegranates and Bells</a></b><br>Decorative elements on the hem of the High Priest's robe, symbolizing fruitfulness and the sound of holiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_bells_and_pomegranates.htm">Symbolism of the Bells and Pomegranates</a></b><br>The bells signified the presence and movement of the High Priest, ensuring that he was heard as he ministered before the Lord.
