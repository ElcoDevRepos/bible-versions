It signifies a covenantal love that is unwavering and committed. This concept is central to the relationship between God and Israel, as seen throughout the Old Testament. God's loving devotion is a recurring theme, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136</a>, where His love endures forever.<p><b>You will lead the people</b><br>God's leadership is a central theme in the Exodus narrative. He leads the Israelites out of Egypt, through the wilderness, and towards the Promised Land. This leadership is both physical and spiritual, guiding them with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). It also foreshadows the leadership of Christ, who leads His people as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>You have redeemed</b><br>Redemption in this context refers to God's deliverance of Israel from slavery in Egypt. This act of redemption is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing God's power and faithfulness. It prefigures the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who redeems humanity from sin (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). The concept of redemption is deeply rooted in the idea of a kinsman-redeemer, as seen in the book of Ruth.<p><b>with Your strength</b><br>God's strength is demonstrated through the miraculous events of the Exodus, such as the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). This strength assures the Israelites of God's ability to protect and sustain them. It is a reminder of His omnipotence, as echoed in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>, where God gives strength to the weary.<p><b>You will guide them</b><br>Guidance here implies not only physical direction but also spiritual instruction. God's guidance is evident in the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai, which provides moral and ethical direction for the Israelites. This guidance is a precursor to the guidance of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>), who leads believers into all truth.<p><b>to Your holy dwelling</b><br>The holy dwelling refers to the Promised Land, a place set apart for God's people. It also alludes to the tabernacle and later the temple, where God's presence dwells among His people. This concept is fulfilled in the New Testament with the coming of Jesus, who is Immanuel, "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>), and ultimately in the New Jerusalem, where God will dwell with His people forever (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people whom God has redeemed from slavery in Egypt.

That same pattern holds for every believer: rescued by grace, sustained by power, guided by the Spirit, and headed home to dwell with the Lord forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13-18) The concluding stanza of the ode involves a change of attitude, and deals with new matters. The poet's eye fixes itself upon the future. First, he speaks of the guidance of God, lately begun, and about to continue until Canaan is reached (<a href="/exodus/15-13.htm" title="You in your mercy have led forth the people which you have redeemed: you have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.">Exodus 15:13</a>). Then his glance turns to the enemies of Israel, and he considers. The effect which the miraculous deliverance of Israel from Egypt will have upon them (<a href="/context/exodus/15-14.htm" title="The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.">Exodus 15:14-16</a>). Finally, he sees the people brought into the "land of their inheritance," and securely established there under the ordering of Divine Providence. Then, with an ascription of glory which may be compared with the Doxology attached to the Lord's Prayer in St. Matthew (<a href="/exodus/6-13.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 6:13</a>), and to that attached in the Liturgies of the Church to the Psalms and Canticles, he terminates his composition.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Hast led forth . . . hast guided.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">leadest forth </span>. . . <span class= "ital">guidest. </span>The guidance was not over; rather, it was just begun.

Moses certainly knew that when Canaan was reached God would select a place to "put His name there" (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm" title="But to the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even to his habitation shall you seek, and thither you shall come:">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm" title="Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall you bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to the LORD:">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-14.htm" title="But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.">Deuteronomy 12:14</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/14-23.htm" title="And you shall eat before the LORD your God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of your corn, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks; that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.">Deuteronomy 14:23-24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-6.htm" title="But at the place which the LORD your God shall choose to place his name in, there you shall sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you came forth out of Egypt.">Deuteronomy 16:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-11.htm" title="And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD your God has chosen to place his name there.">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>, &c.), and possibly knew by revelation what place would be ultimately selected. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou in thy mercy hast led forth</span>.

<a href="/deuteronomy/16-6.htm">Deuteronomy 16:6, 11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>; etc.); and it would seem to be not unlikely that he may have known where the place would be by special revelation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/15-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">With loving devotion</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1430;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7717;as&#183;d&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
