His selection is significant, as it highlights the importance of God-given talents and the divine calling to use those gifts for sacred purposes. The use of acacia wood is notable; it is a durable and resistant wood, symbolizing the enduring nature of God's covenant. Acacia trees were common in the Sinai region, making the material both practical and symbolic of the Israelites' journey.<p><b>two and a half cubits long</b><br>The dimensions of the Ark are precise, reflecting the order and intentionality of God's instructions. A cubit, approximately 18 inches, was a standard unit of measurement in ancient times, based on the length of the forearm. The specific length of two and a half cubits (about 45 inches) signifies the Ark's role as a sacred and set-apart object, not meant for common use. This precision underscores the holiness and reverence required in approaching God.<p><b>a cubit and a half wide</b><br>The width of the Ark, at one and a half cubits (about 27 inches), contributes to its rectangular shape, which is significant in its function as a container for the tablets of the Law. The Ark's dimensions are not only practical but also symbolic, representing the balance and harmony of God's law and presence among His people. The Ark served as the earthly throne of God, where He would meet with Moses and the high priest.<p><b>and a cubit and a half high</b><br>The height of the Ark, also one and a half cubits, completes its dimensions, creating a compact and portable structure. This portability was essential for the Israelites as they traveled through the wilderness. The Ark's height, along with its other dimensions, emphasizes its role as a divine meeting place, where heaven and earth intersect. The Ark prefigures Christ, who is the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity, embodying the fullness of God's presence and law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings.

On the history of the construction of the tabernacle follows naturally that of the construction of its furniture. The order of dignity is followed, as in ch. 25, and the furniture of the holy of holies taken first. Vers. 1-9 correspond to vers. 10-20 of ch. 25; vers. 10-16 to vers. 23-29; vers. 17-24 to vers. 31-39 of the same; and vers. 25-28 to vers. 1-5 of ch. 30.
