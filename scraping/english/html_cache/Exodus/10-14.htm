Locusts are known for their ability to consume vast amounts of vegetation, leading to famine and economic ruin. In the biblical context, this plague is the eighth of ten plagues that God sent upon Egypt to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites from slavery. The swarming of locusts symbolizes divine judgment and the power of God over creation, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a> and <a href="/revelation/9-3.htm">Revelation 9:3</a>.<p><b>and settled over the entire territory of Egypt.</b><br>The locusts covering the entire territory signifies the totality of the plague's impact, leaving no part of Egypt untouched. This emphasizes the severity of God's judgment and the inability of the Egyptians to escape His wrath. Geographically, Egypt was a fertile land, heavily reliant on agriculture, particularly along the Nile River. The locusts' settling over the entire land would have devastated crops and food supplies, highlighting the vulnerability of Egypt's economy and the futility of their gods in protecting them.<p><b>Never before had there been so many locusts,</b><br>This statement underscores the unprecedented nature of this plague. While locust swarms were not uncommon, the magnitude of this event was unparalleled, serving as a clear sign of divine intervention. The hyperbolic language is used to stress the uniqueness of this judgment, aligning with other biblical instances where God performs extraordinary acts to fulfill His purposes, such as the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>).<p><b>and never again will there be.</b><br>This phrase indicates the singularity of this event in history, marking it as a unique act of God. It serves as a prophetic declaration, emphasizing that this particular judgment was a one-time occurrence, designed to demonstrate God's supremacy and to fulfill His covenant promises to Israel. The finality of this statement also points to the ultimate deliverance and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets, bringing a new covenant that surpasses the old (<a

href="/exodus/10-14.htm">Exodus 10:14</a>) pictures an overwhelming, living storm. Scripture records that &#8220;they covered the surface of the ground&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/10-5.htm">Exodus 10:5</a>), moving with military precision (cf. <a href="/proverbs/30-27.htm">Proverbs 30:27</a>; <a href="/joel/2-4.htm">Joel 2:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>- The Lord is showing His power over creation; the insects go where He sends them (<a href="/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34&#8211;35</a>).<p>- For Israel, the sight confirmed the reliability of God&#8217;s warning through Moses (<a href="/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1&#8211;2</a>). For Egypt, it revealed the impotence of their gods who were thought to protect crops and fertility (<a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>settled over the entire territory of Egypt</b><p>- The swarm did not stop at one border or another; it &#8220;settled over the entire territory of Egypt,&#8221; leaving no safe pocket (<a href="/exodus/10-6.htm">Exodus 10:6</a>).<p>- This total coverage underscores that Pharaoh&#8217;s rebellion affected every citizen, echoing earlier judgments that were also nationwide (<a href="/exodus/8-6.htm">Exodus 8:6</a>; 9:6).<p>- Similar language appears in <a href="/revelation/9-3.htm">Revelation 9:3&#8211;4</a>, where locust-like creatures are released in a judgment that also has worldwide scope.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Never before had there been so many locusts</b><p>- The verse is deliberate: no past plague matched this one. Moses could look back on Joseph&#8217;s famine years (<a href="/bsb/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>) or on seasonal swarms (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>) and still say nothing compared.<p>- Joel later calls people to &#8220;tell your children&#8221; about a locust invasion so vast it defies memory (<a href="/joel/1-2.htm">Joel 1:2&#8211;4</a>), echoing the uniqueness of <a href="/bsb/exodus/10.htm">Exodus 10</a>.<p>- This emphasis affirms the historical accuracy of the plague, inviting readers to see it as a singular act of divine judgment rather than embellishment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and never again will there be</b><p>- The final phrase sets the plague apart forever, much like the coming death of the firstborn is described as unparalleled (<a href="/exodus/11-6.htm">Exodus 11:6</a>).<p>- By promising that no future swarm would equal it, God marks the event as an unrepeatable demonstration of His supremacy (<a href="/nahum/1-9.htm">Nahum 1:9</a>).<p>- Jesus employs similar absolute language when describing the Great Tribulation&#8212;&#8220;such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, and never will be&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>), showing that God reserves the right to punctuate history with singular, decisive acts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/10-14.htm">Exodus 10:14</a> records a literal, once-in-history locust plague that blanketed every corner of Egypt. The unparalleled swarm revealed God&#8217;s total command over nature, judged Pharaoh&#8217;s pride, and strengthened Israel&#8217;s faith in their Redeemer. Cross-references throughout Scripture echo its scale and finality, reminding believers that the Lord&#8217;s words are precise, His judgments just, and His promises unfailing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt.</span>--It is not, perhaps, certain that this is intended literally, since universal expressions are continually used by the sacred writers where something less than universality is meant. But, strengthened as the clause is by the succeeding one, we must suppose a very general visitation to be spoken of. Now Egypt extends, from north to south, a distance of above 500 miles, and the Delta has a width of 150 miles. No column of locusts having nearly such dimensions is recorded in history. Perhaps the visitation was confined to the Delta and the vicinity of Memphis. Even so, it would have covered an area of 7,000 square miles, or one nearly equal to that of Wales.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt</span>. This statement is very emphatic, and seems to imply that the plague was more widely extended than any that had preceded it. Egypt extends about 520 miles from north to south, but except in the Delta is not more than about 20 miles wide. Columns of locusts of the length of 500 miles have been noticed by travellers (Moor in Kirby on <span class="accented">Entomology</span>, letter 6.), and 20 miles is not an unusual width for them. But such a length and such a breadth are not elsewhere recorded in combination. Thus the visitation was, in its extent as well as in its circumstances, plainly abnormal. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/10-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The locusts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;ar&#183;beh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
