The Tabernacle was a portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, as described in the Book of Exodus. The curtains served as a boundary, symbolizing separation from the profane world and the holiness within. The use of curtains instead of solid walls emphasizes the temporary and mobile nature of the Tabernacle, reflecting the Israelites' journey through the wilderness.<p><b>were also fifteen cubits long</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Thus, fifteen cubits would be approximately 22.5 feet or 6.75 meters. The specific measurement indicates precision and order in God's instructions, reflecting His nature. The symmetry in the design of the Tabernacle's courtyard, with equal lengths on both sides, symbolizes balance and harmony, which are key themes in the divine order.<p><b>with three posts and three bases as well</b><br>The posts and bases provided structural support for the curtains. The number three often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in biblical numerology, seen in the Trinity and other scriptural instances. The use of three posts and bases may also reflect the triune nature of God, pointing to the completeness and stability found in Him. The materials used for the posts and bases, likely bronze, signify judgment and endurance, as bronze is associated with strength and durability in biblical symbolism.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_courtyard.htm">The Courtyard</a></b><br>The outer area surrounding the Tabernacle, where the altar of burnt offering and the bronze basin were located.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_entrance_to_the_courtyard.htm">The Entrance to the Courtyard</a></b><br>The specific area described in <a href="/exodus/38-15.htm">Exodus 38:15</a>, which was part of the overall design of the Tabernacle's courtyard.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The detailed instructions for the Tabernacle's construction highlight the importance of following God's commands precisely.
