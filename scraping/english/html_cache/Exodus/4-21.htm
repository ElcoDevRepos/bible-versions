It reflects the biblical theme of God choosing and guiding leaders, as seen with figures like Abraham and David. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>When you go back to Egypt</b><br>Moses is returning to the land of his birth, a place of both personal history and national significance. Egypt, a powerful ancient civilization, is often depicted in the Bible as a symbol of oppression and idolatry. Moses' return signifies the beginning of God's deliverance of Israel from slavery.<p><b>see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders</b><br>The "wonders" refer to the miraculous signs God empowers Moses to perform, such as turning the staff into a serpent and the plagues. These acts demonstrate God's supremacy over Egyptian gods and serve as a testament to His power. The confrontation with Pharaoh is a pivotal moment in biblical history, showcasing God's intervention in human affairs.<p><b>that I have put within your power</b><br>This phrase highlights God's sovereignty and the divine origin of Moses' abilities. It underscores the biblical principle that God equips those He calls. The empowerment of Moses is a type of Christ, who performed miracles by divine authority.<p><b>But I will harden his heart</b><br>The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a complex theological concept, illustrating God's control over human will and the unfolding of His redemptive plan. It raises questions about free will and divine justice, which are explored throughout Scripture. This hardening serves to magnify God's glory through the eventual deliverance of Israel.<p><b>so that he will not let the people go</b><br>This outcome sets the stage for the dramatic series of events leading to the Exodus. It demonstrates God's purpose in allowing Pharaoh's resistance, ultimately leading to a greater display of His power and the fulfillment of His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The phrase foreshadows the eventual liberation and the establishment of Israel as a nation under God's covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is orchestrating the deliverance of His people from Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader and prophet of Israel, tasked with confronting Pharaoh and leading the Israelites out of bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart will be hardened by God, leading to a series of plagues and the eventual release of the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, representing a place of oppression and idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wonders.htm">Wonders (Miracles)</a></b><br>The signs and miracles that God empowers Moses to perform as a demonstration of His power and authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God's control over the events in Egypt demonstrates His ultimate authority over nations and rulers.

It is conceivable that these may be simply three forms of speech, and that the actual operation was one and the same in every case. Or, three different modes of operation may be meant. It is in favour of the latter view, that each term has a period during which it is predominant. In the narrative of what happened, the action of the heart is itself predominant in the first period; that of Pharaoh on his heart in the second; that of God in the third. We may suppose that, at first, Pharaoh's nature was simply not impressed, and that then his heart is said to have "hardened itself," or "remained hard;" that after a while, he began to be impressed; but by an effort of his will controlled himself, and determined that he would not yield: thus "hardening his own heart;" finally, that after he had done this twice (<a href="/exodus/8-15.htm" title="But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:15</a>; <a href="/exodus/8-32.htm" title="And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.">Exodus 8:32</a>), God stepped in and "smote him with a spirit of blindness and infatuation," as a judgment upon him (<a href="/exodus/9-12.htm" title="And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had spoken to Moses.">Exodus 9:12</a>), thus, finally, "hardening" him (comp. <a href="/romans/9-18.htm" title="Therefore has he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens.">Romans 9:18</a>). This divine action was repeated, on three subsequent occasions (<a href="/exodus/10-20.htm" title="But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.">Exodus 10:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/10-27.htm" title="But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.">Exodus 10:27</a>; <a href="/exodus/14-8.htm" title="And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.">Exodus 14:8</a>), Pharaoh's time of probation being past, and God using him as a mere means of showing forth His glory. There is nothing in this contrary to the general teaching of the Scriptures, or to the Divine Perfection. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said, etc</span>. Now that Moses had at last given up his own will and entered on the path of obedience, God comforted him with a fresh revelation,, and gave him fresh instructions as to what exactly he was to say to Pharaoh. The statements of ver. 21 are not new, being anticipated in <a href="/exodus/3-19.htm">Exodus 3:19-20</a>; but the directions in vers. 22-23 are wholly new, and point to the greatest of all the miracles wrought in Egypt - the death of the firstborn. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All those wonders</span>. The miracles wrought in Egypt are called <span class="accented">nipheloth</span>, "marvels," <span class="accented">mophethim</span>, "portents," and <span class="accented">othoth</span>, "signs." <span class="accented">Mophethim</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> word here used signifies something out of the ordinary course of nature, and corresponds to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> and the Latin <span class="accented">portenta</span>. It is a different word from that used in <a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>. In "all these wonders" are included, not only the three signs of <a href="/exodus/4-3.htm">Exodus 4:3-9</a>, but the whole series of miracles afterwards wrought in Egypt, and glanced at in <a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>. I will harden his heart. This expression, here used for the first time, and repeated so frequently in chs. 7-14, has given offence to many. Men, it is said, harden their own hearts against God; God does not actively interfere to harden the heart of anyone. And this is so far true, that a special interference of God on the occasion, involving a supernatural hardening of Pharaoh's heart, is not to be thought cf. But among the natural punishments which God has attached to sin, would seem to be the hardening of the entire nature of the man who sins. If men "do not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gives them up to a reprobate mind" (<a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>); if they resist the Spirit, he "takes his holy Spirit from them" (<a href="/psalms/51-11.htm">Psalm 51:11</a>); if they sin against light he withdraws the light; if they stifle their natural affections of kindness, compassion and the like, it is a law of his providence that those affections shall wither and decay. This seems to be the "hardening of the heart here intended - not an abnormal and miraculous interference with the soul of Pharaoh, but the natural effect upon his soul under God's moral government of those acts which he wilfully and wrongfully committed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/4-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">instructed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
