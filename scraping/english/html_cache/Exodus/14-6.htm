In ancient Egypt, chariots were a symbol of military power and technological advancement. The chariot was a key component of Egyptian warfare, often used by the elite and the king himself. This preparation indicates Pharaoh's personal involvement and determination to recapture the Israelites. The chariot's mention highlights the contrast between Egypt's military might and Israel's vulnerable position, relying solely on divine intervention.<p><b>and took his army with him.</b><br>Pharaoh's decision to take his army underscores the seriousness of his intent to bring the Israelites back to Egypt. The Egyptian army was one of the most formidable forces of the ancient world, known for its discipline and strength. This phrase emphasizes the full mobilization of Egypt's military resources against the Israelites. Historically, this pursuit reflects the common practice of ancient Near Eastern kings to personally lead their armies into battle. Theologically, this sets the stage for God's deliverance of Israel, showcasing His power over the mightiest earthly forces. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over evil, as seen in the deliverance through Jesus Christ, who triumphs over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, often seen as a symbol of opposition to God's will.

Though he had repeatedly witnessed God&#8217;s power through the ten plagues, he chooses stubborn defiance (<a href="/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34&#8211;35</a>).<p>- His resolve illustrates <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>: &#8220;No wisdom, no understanding, no counsel can prevail against the LORD.&#8221; Pharaoh&#8217;s every decision ultimately serves God&#8217;s redemptive purpose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>prepared his chariot</b><p>- A royal chariot in ancient Egypt symbolized the height of military technology and personal prestige (compare <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>). Here Pharaoh personally outfits his own chariot, signaling urgency and prideful confidence.<p>- Scripture often contrasts human trust in chariots with reliance on the Lord: &#8220;Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>). Pharaoh is doubling down on earthly power exactly when he should be humbling himself before divine power.<p>- By highlighting the chariot, the narrative sets the stage for the Lord&#8217;s dramatic intervention in verses 24&#8211;25, where those very wheels are made to &#8220;swerve,&#8221; proving how easily God overturns human might.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and took his army with him</b><p>- Pharaoh mobilizes a full fighting force&#8212;&#8220;six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>). This is not a token pursuit but a national military campaign.<p>- His decision to bring &#8220;his army with him&#8221; underscores complete dependence on manpower instead of repentance toward God (<a href="/exodus/14-9.htm">Exodus 14:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8&#8211;12</a>).<p>- The scene invites comparison with later deliverances where the Lord defends His people against overwhelming odds (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-7.htm">2 Chronicles 32:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>). God consistently shows that numerical or technological superiority cannot override His sovereign will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6</a> captures the climactic moment when Pharaoh, with heart hardened and pride intact, personally gears up for battle and musters Egypt&#8217;s finest forces. Each phrase underlines human arrogance set against God&#8217;s declared purpose. Pharaoh&#8217;s self-reliant preparations spotlight the futility of resisting the Lord, paving the way for God&#8217;s ultimate victory at the Red Sea and reminding believers today to trust the Almighty rather than earthly power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">He made ready his chariot.</span>--Egyptian monarchs of the Rameside period almost always led their armies out to battle, and when they did so, uniformly rode with a single attendant, who acted as charioteer, in a two-horse chariot.

The Egyptian monarchs, from the time of the eighteenth dynasty, always went out to war in a chariot. The chariots were, like the Greek and the Assyrian, open behind, and consisted of a semicircular standing-beard of wood, from which rose in a graceful curve the <span class="accented">antyx</span> or rim to the height of about two feet and a half above the standing-beard. The chariot had two wheels and a pole, and was drawn by two horses. It ordinarily contained two men only, the warrior and the charioteer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/14-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So [Pharaoh] prepared</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1462;&#1488;&#1456;&#1505;&#1465;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ye&#8217;&#183;s&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_631.htm">Strong's 631: </a> </span><span class="str2">To yoke, hitch, to fasten, to join battle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his chariot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(ri&#7733;&#183;b&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7393.htm">Strong's 7393: </a> </span><span class="str2">A vehicle, a team, cavalry, a rider, the upper millstone</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1445;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his army</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5973.htm">Strong's 5973: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/14-6.htm">OT Law: Exodus 14:6 He made ready his chariot and took (Exo.
