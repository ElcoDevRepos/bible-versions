It highlights the importance of communication between God and His chosen leader, and subsequently, between the leader and the people. This announcement is a divine command, underscoring the authority of God's word. The context is the impending final plague, which will lead to the Exodus, a pivotal event in Israelite history.<p><b>that men and women alike</b><br>The inclusion of both men and women signifies the collective participation of the entire Israelite community. It reflects the egalitarian aspect of God's instructions, where both genders are involved in the fulfillment of His plans. This also indicates the widespread impact of the upcoming events, affecting every individual within the community.<p><b>should ask their neighbors</b><br>The term "neighbors" refers to the Egyptians living alongside the Israelites. This request is significant as it demonstrates a reversal of roles; the Israelites, who were slaves, are now in a position to request valuable items from their Egyptian neighbors. This act is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>, where He foretold that his descendants would leave their place of bondage with great possessions.<p><b>for articles of silver and gold.</b><br>Silver and gold were symbols of wealth and status in ancient cultures. The request for these items is not merely for material gain but serves a greater purpose in God's plan. These articles would later be used in the construction of the Tabernacle, as described in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25:1-8</a>, signifying their role in worship and the establishment of a covenant community. This act also represents a form of recompense for the years of slavery and oppression the Israelites endured in Egypt.

The command is rooted in earlier promises that He would &#8220;grant this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-21.htm">Exodus 3:21&#8211;22</a>). By speaking up before the final plague strikes, Israel is reminded that deliverance is God&#8217;s work from start to finish&#8212;He foretells it, He orchestrates it, and He sees it through, just as He did when He foretold Abram that his descendants would leave Egypt &#8220;with great possessions&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>). This announcement also reveals God&#8217;s justice: those who oppressed His people will freely give compensation, echoing later assurances that &#8220;it is just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that men and women alike</b><p>The instruction is deliberately inclusive. Every household&#8212;fathers, mothers, single adults, elderly&#8212;shares in God&#8217;s provision. No Israelite is overlooked, foreshadowing the New Covenant reality that all believers, &#8220;male and female,&#8221; are heirs together of grace (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). The collective participation also counters any thought that faith is a spectator sport; each person is personally involved in God&#8217;s rescue plan, much like the entire congregation later participates in the Passover meal (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>should ask their neighbors</b><p>God commands a peaceful request, not a forcible plunder.

Even the misuse of some in the golden calf episode (<a href="/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2&#8211;4</a>) cannot negate God&#8217;s ultimate intent: wealth is a tool for His glory. <a href="/job/27-16.htm">Job 27:16&#8211;17</a> and <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a> echo this transfer theme&#8212;&#8220;the sinner&#8217;s wealth is stored up for the righteous.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/11-2.htm">Exodus 11:2</a> is God&#8217;s precise, practical step in fulfilling a centuries-old promise.
