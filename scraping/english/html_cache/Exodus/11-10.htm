These wonders included the ten plagues, which were direct challenges to the Egyptian gods and demonstrated God's supremacy. The plagues served as both judgment against Egypt and a means to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites. The wonders were not just acts of power but also signs pointing to God's covenant faithfulness to Israel.<p><b>but the LORD hardened Pharaoh&#8217;s heart</b><br>The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a recurring theme in the Exodus narrative. It highlights the tension between divine sovereignty and human responsibility. While Pharaoh initially hardened his own heart, God later confirmed Pharaoh's decision by hardening it further. This act served to fulfill God's purposes, demonstrating His power and ensuring that His name would be proclaimed throughout the earth. It also underscores the biblical principle that persistent rejection of God can lead to a judicial hardening.<p><b>so that he would not let the Israelites go out of his land</b><br>Pharaoh's refusal to release the Israelites was part of God's plan to display His power and deliver His people with a mighty hand. The Israelites' eventual exodus from Egypt is a pivotal event in biblical history, symbolizing redemption and foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ. The land of Egypt, a place of bondage, contrasts with the Promised Land, a place of freedom and blessing.
