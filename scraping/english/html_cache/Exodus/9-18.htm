The use of "behold" serves as a call to attention, emphasizing the seriousness of the forthcoming event. The specificity of "this time tomorrow" underscores God's control over time and events, a theme consistent throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a> when God promises Sarah a son.<p><b>I will rain down</b><br>The phrase "rain down" suggests divine intervention, as rain is often associated with God's provision or judgment. In this context, it is a form of judgment. This is reminiscent of the flood in <a href="/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7</a>, where God used rain as a means of judgment. It also foreshadows future divine judgments, such as those described in Revelation.<p><b>the worst hail that has ever fallen on Egypt</b><br>Hail is a natural phenomenon, but its unprecedented severity here indicates a supernatural act. This plague is one of the ten plagues that demonstrate God's power over the Egyptian gods, specifically Nut, the sky goddess, and Set, the storm god. The severity of the hail serves to show that the God of Israel is supreme over all creation.<p><b>from the day it was founded until now</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the historical significance of the event. Egypt, with its long history and established civilization, had never experienced such a calamity. This highlights the uniqueness of God's intervention.

Thunderstorms are especially uncommon, and when they occur are for the most part mild and harmless. A thunderstorm which killed a man in Thevenot's time (<span class= "ital">Voyages,</span> vol. i., p. 344) was regarded as most extraordinary, and "spread universal consternation." There is hail from time to time between November and March; but it very seldom does any considerable damage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To-morrow about this time</span>. As it might have been thought that Moses had done nothing very extraordinary in predicting a storm for the next day, a more exact note of time than usual was here given. Compare <a href="/exodus/8-23.htm">Exodus 8:23</a>; <a href="/exodus/9-5.htm">Exodus 9:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail</span>. Rain, and, still more, hail are comparatively rare in Egypt, though not so rare as stated by some ancient authors (Herod, 3:10; Pomp. Mela, <span class="accented">De Situ Orbis</span>, 1:9). A good deal of rain falls in the Lower Country, where the north wind brings air loaded with vapour from the Mediterranean; particularly in the winter months from December to March. Snow, and hail, and thunder are during those months not very uncommon, having been witnessed by many modern travellers, as Pococke, Wansleben, Seetzen, Perry, Tooke, and others. They are seldom, however, of any great severity. Such a storm as here described (see especially vers. 23, 24) would be quite strange and abnormal; no Egyptian would have experienced anything approaching to it, and hence the deep impression that it made (ver. 27). <span class="cmt_word">Since the foundation thereof</span>. Not "since the original formation of the country" at the Creation, or by subsequent alluvial deposits, as Herodotus thought (2:5-11), but "since Egypt became a nation" (see ver. 24). Modern Egyptologists, or at any rate a large number of them, carry back this event to a date completely irreconcilable with the Biblical chronology - Bockh to <span class="date">B.C. 5702</span>, Unger to <span class="date">B.C. 5613</span>, Mariette and Lenormant to <span class="date">B.C. 5004</span>, Brugsch to <span class="date">B.C. 4455</span>, Lepsius to <span class="date">B.C. 3852</span>, and Bunsen (in one place) to <span class="date">B.C. 3623</span>. The early Egyptian chronology is, however, altogether uncer-rain, as the variety in these dates sufficiently intimates. Of the dynasties before the (so-called) eighteenth, only seven are proved to be historical, and the time that the Old and Middle Empires lasted is exceedingly doubtful. All the known facts are sufficiently met by such a date as <span class="date">B.C. 2500-2400</span> for the Pyramid Kings, before whose time we have nothing authentic. This is a date which comes well within the period allowed for the formation of nations by the chronology of the Septuagint and Samaritan versions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/9-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124;
