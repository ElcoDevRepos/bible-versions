Gold, a precious metal, symbolizes purity and divinity, often associated with God's holiness. The use of gold in the Tabernacle's furnishings reflects the heavenly reality and the divine presence among the Israelites. The process of casting indicates skilled craftsmanship, aligning with the detailed instructions given by God to Moses for the construction of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23-30</a>). The rings were essential for the mobility of the table, allowing it to be carried with poles, emphasizing the transient nature of the Israelites' journey and God's presence with them.<p><b>and fastened them to the four corners</b><br>The placement of the rings at the four corners of the table ensures stability and balance, symbolizing the completeness and perfection of God's provision. The number four often represents universality in the Bible, suggesting that God's sustenance and presence are available to all His people. This design also reflects the practical need for the table to be carried without tilting, ensuring the sacred bread remains secure. The corners signify the extremities of the earth, hinting at the future spread of the Gospel to all nations.<p><b>at its four legs</b><br>The mention of the table's four legs highlights the structure's stability and readiness for transport. The legs support the table, just as God's Word supports the faith of believers. The table's design, with its legs and rings, allows it to be lifted and moved, symbolizing the journey of faith and the movement of God's people towards the Promised Land. This mobility foreshadows the Christian mission to spread the Gospel, as believers are called to carry the message of Christ to the ends of the earth. The table, with its bread, points to Jesus as the Bread of Life, sustaining and nourishing His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the Ark of the Covenant, the Table of Showbread, and other sacred items.
