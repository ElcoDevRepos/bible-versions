Moses, having been a shepherd in Midian, would be familiar with its practical uses. In biblical context, the staff represents God's power and presence. It is a tangible reminder of God's call and empowerment of Moses. The staff will later be used to perform miracles, signifying God's direct intervention in the events of the Exodus. This phrase emphasizes the importance of obedience and trust in God's provision.<p><b>so you can perform signs with it.</b><br>The signs are miraculous acts that demonstrate God's power and authenticate Moses' divine commission. These signs are not just for Pharaoh but also for the Israelites, to confirm that God has indeed sent Moses. The use of signs is a recurring theme in Scripture, often serving as a means to reveal God's will and to validate His messengers. In the New Testament, Jesus performs signs and wonders, fulfilling the role of the ultimate prophet and deliverer. The staff, therefore, becomes a type of Christ, symbolizing divine authority and the means through which God accomplishes His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
