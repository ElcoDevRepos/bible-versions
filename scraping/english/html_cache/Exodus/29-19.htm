The first ram was used for a burnt offering, symbolizing complete dedication to God. The second ram, often referred to as the "ram of ordination," is specifically for the consecration of the priests. This act underscores the importance of a multi-step process in sanctifying those who will serve in the priestly role, emphasizing thorough preparation and dedication.<p><b>and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on its head</b><br>The laying on of hands is a symbolic act of identification and transference. By placing their hands on the ram's head, Aaron and his sons identify with the sacrifice, symbolically transferring their sins and responsibilities onto the animal. This act signifies the substitutionary nature of the sacrifice, a concept that is foundational in the sacrificial system and points forward to the ultimate substitutionary sacrifice of Jesus Christ. This practice is also seen in <a href="/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4 and 16</a>:21, where it represents the transfer of sin and guilt. The laying on of hands is a precursor to the New Testament practice of laying on hands for blessing, healing, and ordination, as seen in <a href="/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
