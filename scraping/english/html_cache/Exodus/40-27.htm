The incense was made from a specific blend of spices as outlined in <a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>, which was considered holy and set apart for this purpose. The altar of incense was located in the Holy Place, just before the veil that separated the Holy of Holies, indicating the closeness of prayer to the presence of God. The act of burning incense was performed by the priest, signifying the mediatory role between God and the people. This practice foreshadows the intercessory work of Jesus Christ, who is described in <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a> as always living to intercede for those who come to God through Him.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded him</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's instructions, which is a recurring theme throughout the book of Exodus. The detailed commands given to Moses for the construction and operation of the tabernacle highlight the necessity of following divine guidance precisely. This obedience is not only a matter of ritual but also a demonstration of faith and reverence for God's holiness. The phrase echoes the broader biblical principle that blessings and the presence of God are contingent upon adherence to His commands, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The meticulous obedience of Moses and the Israelites in this context serves as a model for believers, emphasizing that true worship involves aligning one's actions with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
