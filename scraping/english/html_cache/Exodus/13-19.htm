Joseph's bones symbolize the continuity of God's promises to the Israelites. Joseph, who had risen to power in Egypt, had faith that God would fulfill His promise to bring the Israelites back to the Promised Land. This act of taking Joseph's bones is a fulfillment of that faith and a reminder of God's faithfulness. It also signifies the importance of burial practices and honoring one's ancestors in ancient Near Eastern culture.<p><b>because Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear a solemn oath</b><br>Joseph's request for an oath underscores the seriousness and binding nature of promises in ancient times. Oaths were considered sacred and unbreakable, often invoking God's name as a witness. This reflects the cultural and religious importance of oaths in maintaining trust and accountability within the community. The sons of Israel, representing the tribes, were bound by this oath, showing the collective responsibility to fulfill Joseph's last wishes.<p><b>when he said, &#8220;God will surely attend to you</b><br>Joseph's statement is a prophetic assurance of God's providence and care for His people. It reflects Joseph's unwavering faith in God's promises, despite the Israelites' current situation in Egypt. This phrase connects to God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, promising them the land of Canaan. It also foreshadows the Exodus, where God indeed attends to the Israelites by delivering them from slavery.<p><b>and then you must carry my bones with you from this place.&#8221;</b><br>This command emphasizes the importance of the Promised Land as the true home for the Israelites. Joseph's desire to have his bones carried to Canaan signifies his belief in God's promise and his identification with the future of Israel. It also serves as a type of Christ, as Joseph's life and actions prefigure aspects of Jesus' life, such as faithfulness, leadership, and the hope of resurrection. The act of carrying his bones is a tangible reminder of the hope and future that God has promised to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who led them out of Egypt.

Joseph, firmly believing in the promise of God to give Canaan to the descendants of Abraham had made them swear to take his body with them when they left Egypt. The desire to be laid in their native earth was common to most of the nations of antiquity, and, in the case of the Israelites, was intensified by Canaan being the "laud of promise." Jacob had had the same feeling as Joseph, and had been buried by Joseph in the cave of Math-pelah (<a href="/genesis/50-13.htm">Genesis 50:13</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/13-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
