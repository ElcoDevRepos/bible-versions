Aaron, Moses' brother, is chosen by God to assist Moses in the mission to free the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. This highlights God's sovereignty and His ability to orchestrate events according to His will. Aaron's role as a spokesperson is significant, as Moses had expressed his own inadequacies in speech (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10-16</a>). This divine communication underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands.<p><b>&#8220;Go and meet Moses in the wilderness.&#8221;</b><br>The wilderness often symbolizes a place of testing and preparation in the Bible. It is in the wilderness that God prepares His people for future tasks. Aaron's journey to meet Moses signifies a pivotal moment in the unfolding of God's plan for Israel's deliverance. The wilderness also serves as a backdrop for divine encounters, as seen in Moses' earlier experience with the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3:1-4</a>).<p><b>So he went and met Moses at the mountain of God</b><br>The "mountain of God" refers to Mount Horeb, also known as Mount Sinai. This location is significant as it is where Moses first encountered God in the burning bush and where the Israelites would later receive the Ten Commandments (Exodus 19-20). The mountain represents a place of divine revelation and covenant. Aaron's meeting with Moses here foreshadows the significant events that will occur at this sacred site.<p><b>and kissed him.</b><br>The act of kissing in ancient Near Eastern culture was a common greeting among family members and close friends, symbolizing affection and reconciliation. This gesture indicates the bond between the brothers and their mutual commitment to the task ahead. It also reflects the unity and cooperation necessary for the fulfillment of God's plan. The kiss can be seen as a sign of peace and solidarity, essential for the leadership they will provide to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is orchestrating the events and guiding His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother, who is called by God to assist Moses in leading the Israelites out of Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader of the Israelites, who has been called by God to deliver His people from slavery.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The region where Moses was tending sheep and where God called him through the burning bush.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain_of_god.htm">The Mountain of God</a></b><br>Also known as Mount Horeb or Sinai, a significant place where God reveals Himself and gives His commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_appointment.htm">Divine Appointment</a></b><br>God orchestrates meetings and events according to His divine plan.

Moses is left in the wilderness to recover his strength and make such arrangements with respect to his wife and children as he thinks best under the circumstances. We are carried away to Egypt and introduced to Aaron, Moses' elder brother, of whom we have only heard previously that he could "speak well," and was to assist Moses as spokesman in his enterprise (<a href="/exodus/4-14.htm">Exodus 4:14-16</a>). We now find God revealing himself to Aaron also, and directing his movements, as he had those of Moses. Aaron had perhaps already formed the design of visiting his brother (see ver. 14), and would have sought him in Midian but for the direction now given him. That direction was probably more definite than is expressed in the text, and enabled him to set forth confidently, without the fear of missing his brother. At any rate, under God's guidance he went and met him in the Sinaitic district. The joy of meeting is briefly described in the single phrase "he kissed him." The meeting was followed by a full explanation, on the part of Moses, both of the nature of his own mission and of the part which Aaron was to take in it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go into the wilderness</span>. It is scarcely possible that this can have been the whole of the direction given, since the wilderness extended from the shores of the Mediterranean to the extreme point of the Sinaitic peninsula. The sacred writers study brevity, and leave much to be supplied by the common-sense of the reader. <span class="cmt_word">He went and met him in the mount of God</span>. Compare above, <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>, which shows that Horeb is meant. Horeb seems to have been the name for the entire mountain region, of which Sinai was a part. Kissed him. So Esau kissed Jacob after their long separation (<a href="/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4</a>), and Joseph, Benjamin and his other brethren (<a href="/genesis/45-14.htm">Genesis 45:14, 15</a>). In the East men are more demonstrative than with us.
