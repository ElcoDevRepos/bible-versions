The "bud" here refers to the almond blossom, which is a recurring motif in the design of the lampstand. The almond tree is one of the first to bloom in Israel, symbolizing watchfulness and awakening. This imagery is fitting for the lampstand, which provides light, symbolizing God's presence and guidance. The lampstand itself was made of pure gold, emphasizing its sacred purpose in the Tabernacle, where it stood in the Holy Place. The branches extending from the central shaft represent the unity and diversity of God's people, with the buds symbolizing life and growth.<p><b>a bud under the second pair</b><br>The repetition of the design with a bud under each pair of branches highlights the meticulous and intentional craftsmanship commanded by God. Each pair of branches with its corresponding bud signifies completeness and order, reflecting the divine nature of God's instructions. The menorah's structure, with its central shaft and three pairs of branches, can be seen as a representation of the Tree of Life, connecting it to the Garden of Eden and the promise of eternal life. The menorah's light, fueled by pure olive oil, symbolizes the Holy Spirit, who illuminates and empowers believers.<p><b>and a bud under the third pair</b><br>The third pair of branches completes the symmetrical design of the menorah, with each bud reinforcing the theme of life and continuity. The number three often signifies divine perfection and completeness in biblical numerology. The menorah's seven lamps, with three pairs of branches and a central shaft, create a total of seven lights, a number symbolizing spiritual perfection and God's covenant with humanity. The menorah's light was to burn continually, representing the perpetual presence of God among His people. This imagery foreshadows Jesus Christ, who declared Himself the Light of the World, fulfilling the symbolism of the menorah by bringing spiritual illumination and life to all who believe in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the lampstand, according to the divine pattern given to Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the Tabernacle and its furnishings from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites, where the lampstand was placed in the Holy Place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lampstand.htm">The Lampstand (Menorah)</a></b><br>A sacred object made of pure gold, designed with branches and buds, symbolizing light and life, and placed in the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, for whom the Tabernacle was constructed as a place of worship and divine encounter.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_light.htm">Symbolism of Light</a></b><br>The lampstand represents God's light and presence among His people.

Against the backdrop of the wilderness tabernacle, this decorative detail points to God&#8217;s intent that His people flourish in a barren place (<a href="/numbers/17-8.htm">Numbers 17:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The lampstand itself prefigures Christ, &#8220;the true light that gives light to everyone&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>), while the first pair of branches hints at the first disciples who would carry that light (<a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A bud under the second pair</b><p>&#8226; Repetition deepens the lesson: every branch, not merely the first, carries identical promise. God&#8217;s provision is consistent (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; In Zechariah&#8217;s vision of a lampstand supplied by two olive trees (<a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2&#8211;3</a>), the prophet learns that God&#8217;s work succeeds &#8220;not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>). The recurring buds in Exodus anticipate that Spirit-empowered supply.<p>&#8226; The twin branches also remind us of the two tablets of the covenant housed nearby (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). Light and law belong together; revelation is always meant to illuminate obedience (<a href="/psalms/19-8.htm">Psalm 19:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A bud under the third pair</b><p>&#8226; With six branches total (three pairs), the pattern reaches completion, echoing the six days of creation (<a href="/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1</a>). The buds announce that the Creator who once brought forth life out of nothing still brings life into worship.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/1-12.htm">Revelation 1:12&#8211;13</a> describes &#8220;seven golden lampstands&#8221; among which the risen Christ walks. The final pair in Exodus points forward to this complete, perfected witness&#8212;branches joined to a central shaft yet spreading light worldwide (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; That every branch receives a bud affirms the believer&#8217;s personal calling to bear fruit (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4&#8211;8</a>). None are ornamental only; all are intended to blossom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/37-21.htm">Exodus 37:21</a> highlights three identical buds placed beneath each of the lampstand&#8217;s branch pairs. These details underscore God&#8217;s insistence on exact obedience, His promise of life in unlikely places, and the universal call for every bearer of His light to flourish. Together they point from the tabernacle&#8217;s golden artwork to Christ, the Light of the world, and to His people who shine with Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/37-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A bud</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1441;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;ap&#772;&#183;t&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
