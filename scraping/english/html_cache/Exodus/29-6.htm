In the ancient Near Eastern context, head coverings often denoted status and role. The high priest's turban was distinct, setting him apart for his sacred duties. This act of placing the turban on Aaron's head was part of the ordination process, signifying his readiness to serve as a mediator between God and the Israelites. The turban's placement on the head, the seat of thought and decision-making, underscores the importance of purity and holiness in leadership.<p><b>and attach the holy diadem to the turban</b><br>The holy diadem, or "plate," was a gold plate inscribed with "Holy to the LORD" (<a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>). This inscription served as a constant reminder of the high priest's role in maintaining the sanctity of the worship and the people. The diadem's attachment to the turban signifies the inseparable nature of holiness and leadership. This imagery foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect holiness and intercession. The diadem's presence on the forehead, visible to all, emphasizes the public nature of the priest's dedication to God, paralleling the call for believers to live visibly holy lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is instructed by God to consecrate Aaron and his sons as priests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, chosen by God to be the first high priest of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where the consecration of the priests takes place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_turban.htm">The Turban</a></b><br>A part of the high priest's garments, symbolizing holiness and dedication to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_diadem.htm">The Holy Diadem</a></b><br>A sacred emblem attached to the turban, representing the holiness and authority of the high priest.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_turban_and_diadem.htm">Symbolism of the Turban and Diadem</a></b><br>The turban and diadem symbolize the holiness and authority bestowed upon the high priest.

In Egypt, such a diadem is found first in the reign of Amenophis IV. (Khuenaten), the ninth king of the eighteenth dynasty. The assignment of a crown to the high priest gave him that quasi-royal dignity which marked him as a type of our Lord in His threefold office of Prophet, Priest, and King.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The holy crown</span>. The plate of gold with its blue ribbon, or lace, formed a species of diadem, such as in the East seems to have been always regarded as the special emblem of royalty. An ornament of the kind seems to have been introduced into Egypt by Khuenaten or Amenophis IV. It marked the royal character of the high priest, who, as the main type of Christ in the Mosaic law, was bound to be "Prophet, Priest, and King."
