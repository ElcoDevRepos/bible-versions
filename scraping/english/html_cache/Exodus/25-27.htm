In the context of the Tabernacle, every detail was meticulously designed to ensure the holiness and functionality of the items used in worship. The proximity to the rim suggests a practical design, ensuring that the poles would not interfere with the table's surface or the items placed upon it. This detail reflects the broader biblical theme of God's attention to detail and order, as seen in the creation narrative and the precise instructions given for the construction of the Tabernacle.<p><b>to serve as holders for the poles</b><br>The use of rings as holders for poles is a practical solution for the mobility required of the Israelites during their wilderness journey. This design allowed the table to be carried without direct contact, preserving its sanctity. The poles and rings system is also seen in the construction of the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-12.htm">Exodus 25:12-15</a>), emphasizing the sacredness and untouchability of these holy objects. This method of transport underscores the transient nature of the Israelites' journey and their reliance on God's guidance, as well as the need for reverence in handling items dedicated to worship.<p><b>used to carry the table</b><br>The table referred to here is the Table of Showbread, which held the bread of the Presence, symbolizing God's provision and covenant with Israel. The portability of the table highlights the nomadic lifestyle of the Israelites and their dependence on God's presence as they traveled. This aspect of the table's design points to the broader theme of God's provision and presence with His people, a theme that is fulfilled in the New Testament with Jesus Christ, who is the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). The carrying of the table by poles also prefigures the carrying of the cross by Christ, symbolizing the burden of sin He bore for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1.

href="/exodus/25-27.htm">Exodus 25:27</a> opens by locating the four gold rings &#8220;close to the rim&#8221; of the Table of the Presence. The detail is neither ornamental nor incidental; it is part of the pattern God showed Moses on the mountain (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Precision matters. Just as Noah built the ark exactly to God&#8217;s specifications (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>), Israel was to follow every measurement so the earthly sanctuary would mirror heavenly realities (<a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Stability and protection. Rings positioned near the rim kept the poles high enough that, when the table was lifted, the sacred bread remained level and secure. This echoes the earlier command to add a rim itself &#8220;a handbreadth wide&#8221; as a guard (<a href="/exodus/25-25.htm">Exodus 25:25&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; Holiness defined by boundaries. The rim marks where common hands must not trespass. Likewise, the courtyard, veil, and mercy seat all delineate access points to God (<a href="/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31&#8211;33</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>), reminding worshippers that His holiness must be approached on His terms.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s presence travels with His people. The table, like the ark, lampstand, and altar, was built for movement (<a href="/exodus/25-12.htm">Exodus 25:12&#8211;15</a>; 30:4&#8211;5). Rings near the top ensured the load could be lifted swiftly whenever the pillar of cloud moved (<a href="/numbers/9-17.htm">Numbers 9:17&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to serve as holders for the poles used to carry the table</b><p>The verse continues by explaining the practical role of the rings: &#8220;to serve as holders for the poles used to carry the table.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Mobility safeguarded reverence. Only the poles&#8212;not human hands&#8212;were to touch the holy furniture (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). Centuries later, Uzzah&#8217;s fatal touch of the ark (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6&#8211;7</a>) underscored why God&#8217;s method must be honored.<p>&#8226; Ministry requires readiness. In the wilderness every object of worship was portable; God&#8217;s people were on pilgrimage (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a>). The poles signified that worship wasn&#8217;t tied to one place but to covenant obedience wherever He led (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-33.htm">Deuteronomy 1:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Shared responsibility. The Kohathites shouldered these poles (<a href="/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4&#8211;8</a>). Carrying the table was a tangible reminder that fellowship with God&#8212;the bread of the Presence&#8212;depends on priestly mediation (cf. <a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Foreshadowing Christ. The bread pointed to Jesus, the &#8220;living bread that came down from heaven&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>). The poles kept that symbol always before Israel, just as the gospel must be borne into every place today (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/25-27.htm">Exodus 25:27</a> demonstrates God&#8217;s meticulous care for both the sanctity and the mobility of His dwelling place. Rings placed &#8220;close to the rim&#8221; protect the holy bread and mark sacred boundaries, while their function as &#8220;holders for the poles&#8221; ensures the table can travel without irreverent contact. The verse affirms that divine details matter, that holiness accompanies God&#8217;s people wherever He leads, and that every element of the tabernacle ultimately points to Christ, our true bread and abiding presence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Over against the border shall the rings be.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">opposite the band, </span>or <span class= "ital">framing. </span>The meaning is not very clear. If the framing had been at the bottom of the legs, we might have understood that the rings were attached to the table opposite the places where the "framing<span class= "ital">" </span>was inserted into the legs. But the "framing" appears to have been halfway up the legs (see Note on <a href="/exodus/25-25.htm" title="And you shall make to it a border of an hand breadth round about, and you shall make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.">Exodus 25:25</a>), while the rings were at the bottom.

Bishop Patrick supposes that the table "was not carried up as high as the ark was, but hung down between the priests, on whose shoulders the staves rested." But it is carried upright in the bas-relief on the Arch of Titus, and might have been as easily so carried as the ark. (See the comment on ver. 12.) <span class="cmt_word">Of the staves.</span> Rather, "for staves."
