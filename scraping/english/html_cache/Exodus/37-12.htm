The "rim" mentioned here is part of the table of showbread, which was placed in the Holy Place of the Tabernacle. A "handbreadth" is an ancient unit of measurement approximately equal to four inches, indicating the width of the rim. This detail emphasizes the precision and care in following God's instructions for the Tabernacle's construction, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/25-25.htm">Exodus 25:25</a>. The rim served both a practical purpose, preventing items from falling off, and a symbolic one, representing the boundary of holiness.<p><b>and put a gold molding on the rim</b><br>The use of gold signifies the table's sacred purpose and the divine presence it represents. Gold, a symbol of purity and value, was extensively used in the Tabernacle, reflecting God's glory and majesty. The molding added an element of beauty and distinction, setting the table apart as holy. This gold molding can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of the Tabernacle's symbolism, embodying divine purity and serving as the mediator between God and humanity. The meticulous attention to detail in the Tabernacle's construction foreshadows the perfection and completeness found in Christ's redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its furnishings.
