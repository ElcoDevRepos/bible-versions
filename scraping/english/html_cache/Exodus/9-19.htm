In the context of the plagues of Egypt, this is the seventh plague, which is a turning point in the narrative. The Egyptians were primarily an agrarian society, heavily reliant on livestock and agriculture for their economy and sustenance. The instruction to shelter livestock indicates a divine warning that offers a chance for protection, highlighting God's mercy even amidst judgment. This also demonstrates God's control over nature, contrasting with the Egyptian gods who were believed to have power over the elements.<p><b>Every man or beast that remains in the field and is not brought inside will die</b><br>This phrase underscores the severity of the plague and the certainty of God's word. The inclusion of both man and beast emphasizes the indiscriminate nature of the judgment, affecting all who do not heed the warning. Historically, this would have been a significant threat, as both human life and livestock were crucial for survival. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the importance of heeding divine warnings. This can be seen as a type of final judgment, where those who do not seek refuge in God's provision face destruction.<p><b>when the hail comes down upon them.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Hail in the ancient Near East was a rare but devastating phenomenon, often associated with divine wrath. The specificity of the plague&#8212;hail&#8212;demonstrates God's power over the natural world and serves as a direct challenge to the Egyptian deities, such as Nut, the sky goddess, and Set, the storm god. This event foreshadows future divine judgments and can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides shelter and protection from the ultimate judgment. The hail also connects to other scriptural instances of divine judgment through natural disasters, such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, who is delivering God's message to Pharaoh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened against letting the Israelites go.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved and where the plagues are taking place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plague_of_hail.htm">The Plague of Hail</a></b><br>The seventh plague sent by God upon Egypt as a judgment and a demonstration of His power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/livestock_and_field_workers.htm">Livestock and Field Workers</a></b><br>The subjects of God's warning, representing both economic resources and human lives.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/heeding_god's_warnings.htm">Heeding God's Warnings</a></b><br>God's warnings are acts of mercy, providing an opportunity for repentance and protection.<br><br>Ignoring divine warnings can lead to severe consequences, both physically and spiritually.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>The plagues demonstrate God's control over nature and His ability to protect or judge as He sees fit.<br><br>Recognizing God's sovereignty should lead to reverence and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_obedience.htm">Faith and Obedience</a></b><br>Faith is demonstrated through obedience to God's instructions, even when they challenge our understanding or comfort.<br><br>Obedience to God often requires immediate and decisive action.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_care_for_all_creation.htm">God's Care for All Creation</a></b><br>God's concern extends beyond humans to all of creation, as seen in His warning to protect livestock.<br><br>Stewardship of God's creation is a responsibility given to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_9_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 9:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_19_God_s_warning_and_mercy.htm">How does Exodus 9:19 demonstrate God's warning and mercy before judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/God_s_command_to_avoid_plague_in_Exodus_9_19.htm">What actions does God command in Exodus 9:19 to avoid the coming plague?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_heed_God_s_warnings_today.htm">How can we apply the principle of heeding God's warnings in our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_19_vs_Noah_God_s_protection.htm">Compare Exodus 9:19 with Noah's flood; how does God provide protection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_19_Trust_God_s_guidance.htm">How does Exodus 9:19 encourage us to trust God's instructions during trials?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_19_God_s_power_over_all.htm">How does Exodus 9:19 demonstrate God's power over nature and human affairs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Exodus_9_19_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Exodus 9:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_19_God_s_justice_mercy.htm">How does Exodus 9:19 reflect God's justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_exodus_9_6_mention_surviving_livestock.htm">How can Exodus 9:6 say all Egyptian livestock died, yet later verses still refer to surviving livestock?

Like Noah warning of the coming flood (<a href="/genesis/6-13.htm">Genesis 6:13&#8211;22</a>), the Pharaoh is offered a clear directive that could spare life if obeyed. The verse underscores that:<p>&#8226; Divine warnings are gracious, not merely punitive.<p>&#8226; Obedience must be prompt, not delayed (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Leadership carries responsibility&#8212;Pharaoh&#8217;s choice will affect an entire nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to shelter your livestock and everything you have in the field</b><p>The order is specific: move every animal and any field worker under cover.

The plague previews later judgments such as the hail of <a href="/revelation/16-21.htm">Revelation 16:21</a>.

Every year, at the time of the inundation, all the cattle had to be "gathered" into sheds and cattle-yards in the immediate vicinity of the villages and towns, which were protected from the inundation by high mounds. Thus it would have been easy to house all the cattle that remained to the Egyptians after the murrain, if the warning here given had been attended to generally.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field</span>. During winter and early spring, the Egyptians kept their cattle "in the field," as other nations commonly do. When the inundation began (June or July), they were obliged to bring them into the cities and enclosed villages, and house them. The time of the "Plague of Hail" appears by all the indications w have been the middle of February. <span class="cmt_word">They shall die</span>. Human life was now for the first time threatened. Any herdsmen that remained with the cattle in the open field and did not seek the shelter of houses or sheds would be smitten by the huge jagged hailstones with such force that they would be killed outright, or else die of their wounds. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/9-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
