This highlights the seriousness of their sin with the golden calf (Exodus 32). The Israelites' reaction to this news underscores their understanding of the gravity of losing God's presence, which was central to their identity and success. This moment is pivotal, as it reflects the consequences of disobedience and the importance of God's presence among His people.<p><b>they went into mourning</b><br>Mourning in the ancient Near East often involved specific rituals and expressions of grief, such as wearing sackcloth, ashes, or fasting. The Israelites' mourning indicates a deep sense of loss and repentance. This act of mourning can be seen as a communal acknowledgment of their sin and a desire for reconciliation with God. It parallels other instances in Scripture where mourning leads to repentance and restoration, such as in the story of Nineveh in <a href="/jonah/3.htm">Jonah 3</a>.<p><b>and no one put on any of his jewelry</b><br>Jewelry in ancient times was not only a sign of wealth and beauty but also had religious and cultural significance. By removing their jewelry, the Israelites were likely demonstrating humility and penitence, stripping away symbols of pride and self-adornment. This act can be seen as a form of consecration, setting themselves apart for God. It also connects to the earlier incident with the golden calf, where jewelry was used to create the idol (<a href="/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2-4</a>), symbolizing a rejection of past idolatry and a return to faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now journeying through the wilderness toward the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people and mediate between them and God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses and where the Israelites camped during this period.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>A place where Moses would meet with God, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ornaments.htm">The Ornaments</a></b><br>Jewelry or adornments that the Israelites removed as a sign of mourning and repentance after hearing God's displeasure.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_weight_of_sin.htm">The Weight of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has serious consequences, and the Israelites' mourning reflects the gravity of their disobedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_humility.htm">Repentance and Humility</a></b><br>Removing ornaments symbolizes a heart posture of repentance and humility before God.

Genuine sorrow over sin, visible obedience, and longing for restored fellowship with the LORD mark true repentance then and now.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">When the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned.</span>--It was something that the people felt the tidings to be "evil." It is natural for sinful men to shrink from the near presence of God (<a href="/matthew/8-34.htm" title="And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they sought him that he would depart out of their coasts.">Matthew 8:34</a>; <a href="/luke/5-8.htm" title="When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.">Luke 5:8</a>); and so the Israelites had shrunk from it a short time previously (<a href="/exodus/20-19.htm" title="And they said to Moses, Speak you with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.">Exodus 20:19</a>). Even now they would probably have feared a too near contact; but still, they were unwilling that God should cease to be the leader and guide of the host: they set a value on His presence and protection, which they felt that that of an angel would ill replace. Accordingly, when Moses communicated to them what God had said (<a href="/context/exodus/33-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Depart, and go up hence, you and the people which you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed will I give it:">Exodus 33:1-3</a>), they "mourned," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, not only grieved inwardly, but showed the outward tokens of grief--made a public and, as it were, national lamentation.<p><span class= "bld">No man did put on him his ornaments.</span>--The Orientals, both men and women, have always affected ornament, and taken an extreme delight in it. Herodotus tells us that the Persians who accompanied Xerxes into Greece wore generally collars and bracelets of gold (<span class= "ital">Hist. ix.</span> 80). Xenophon says that the Medes indulged a similar taste (<span class= "ital">Cyrop?d</span>. i. 3, ? 2). In Egypt, at the time of the exodus, men of station wore generally collars, armlets, and bracelets, occasionally anklets. The Assyrians wore armlets, bracelets, and ear-rings. To strip himself of his ornaments was a great act of self-denial on the part of an Oriental; but it was done commonly in the case of mourning on account of a family bereavement, and sometimes in the case of national misfortunes. (See Note on <a href="/context/exodus/33-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Depart, and go up hence, you and the people which you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed will I give it:">Exodus 33:1-6</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span> <span class="cmt_word">the people heard.</span> Moses had communicated to the people what God had said to him.
