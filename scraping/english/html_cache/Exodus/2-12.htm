The phrase suggests caution and a desire for secrecy, highlighting Moses' awareness of the potential consequences of his actions. This moment reflects the tension between his Hebrew identity and his Egyptian upbringing. The act of looking around suggests a moment of internal conflict and decision-making, which is a recurring theme in Moses' life. This phrase also foreshadows Moses' future role as a leader who must make difficult decisions, often in isolation.<p><b>he struck down the Egyptian</b><br>This act of violence is significant as it marks Moses' first recorded action in defense of his Hebrew brethren. It demonstrates his identification with the Israelites and his rejection of Egyptian oppression. The act of striking down the Egyptian can be seen as a precursor to the plagues and judgments that God would later bring upon Egypt. It also reflects the theme of deliverance, as Moses begins to act as a deliverer, albeit prematurely and through his own strength rather than God's guidance.<p><b>and hid his body in the sand</b><br>The act of hiding the body suggests Moses' awareness of the gravity of his actions and his attempt to conceal them. This reflects the human tendency to cover up sin and wrongdoing, a theme that is prevalent throughout Scripture. The sand of Egypt, a land known for its deserts, serves as a temporary cover, symbolizing the futility of hiding sin from God. This action foreshadows Moses' later flight to Midian, as his attempt to hide the murder ultimately fails. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of sin and redemption, as Moses' journey from this point leads him to become the leader God uses to deliver His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew by birth, raised in Pharaoh's household, who becomes a central figure in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt.

But it was clearly the deed of a hasty and undisciplined spirit. The offence did not deserve death, and if it had, Moses had neither legal office nor Divine call, justifying him in making himself an executioner. The result was, that, by his one wrong act, Moses put it out of his power to do anything towards alleviating the sufferings of his brethren for forty years.<p><span class= "bld">Hid him in the sand.</span>--To the east of the Delta the sand creeps up close to the cultivated grounds.

Passion did not so move him as to make him reckless. He looked round to see that he was not observed,, and then, <span class="cmt_word">when he saw there was no man, slew the Egyptian</span>. A wrongful act, the outcome of an ardent but undisciplined spirit; not to be placed among the deeds "which history records as noble and magnanimous (Kalisch), but among those which are hasty and regrettable. A warm sympathetic nature, an indignant hatred of wrong-doing, may have lain at the root of the crime, but do not justify it, though they may qualify our condemnation of it. (See the remarks of St. Augustine quoted by Keil and Delitzsch, 'Commentary on the Pentateuch,' vol. 1. p. 451: "I affirm that the man, though criminal and really the offender, ought not to have been put to death by one who had no legal authority to do so. But minds that are capable of virtue often produce vices also, and show thereby for what virtue they would have been best adapted, if they had but been properely trained," etc.) <span class="cmt_word">And hid him in the sand</span>. There is abundant "sand" in the "field of Zoan," and in all the more eastern portion of the land of Goshen. (See the 'Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund' for July, 1880, p. 140.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After looking</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1508;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;p&#772;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
