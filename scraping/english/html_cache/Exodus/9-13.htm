It underscores the authority of the message that follows, as it originates from God Himself. This pattern of God speaking to Moses is consistent throughout the Exodus narrative, highlighting Moses' unique relationship with God (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>, <a href="/exodus/6-2.htm">Exodus 6:2</a>).<p><b>Get up early in the morning</b><br>Rising early signifies urgency and importance. In ancient Near Eastern culture, early morning was often a time for significant activities or announcements. This timing also suggests a strategic approach, as Pharaoh would likely be more accessible at this time, possibly during his morning rituals or inspections (<a href="/exodus/7-15.htm">Exodus 7:15</a>).<p><b>stand before Pharaoh</b><br>Moses is instructed to confront Pharaoh directly, demonstrating boldness and divine backing. This confrontation is part of a series of encounters where Moses acts as God's representative, challenging the authority of Pharaoh, who was considered a god in Egyptian culture. This phrase also highlights the ongoing conflict between the God of Israel and the gods of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/5.htm">Exodus 5:1-2</a>).<p><b>and tell him that this is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says</b><br>This statement establishes the identity and authority of the speaker. "The LORD" (Yahweh) is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His relationship with the Hebrews. By identifying as the "God of the Hebrews," it distinguishes Yahweh from the Egyptian pantheon and asserts His sovereignty over His people. This declaration is a reminder of the covenant promises made to the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>).<p><b>&#8216;Let My people go, so that they may worship Me</b><br>The demand for release is not merely for freedom but for the purpose of worship. This highlights the central theme of worship and service to God, which is a recurring motif throughout the Bible. The phrase "My people" signifies God's ownership and covenant relationship with Israel. The call to worship is a direct challenge to Pharaoh's authority, as it implies that the Israelites' ultimate allegiance is to God, not to Pharaoh. This request is repeated throughout the plagues, emphasizing its importance (<a href="/exodus/7-16.htm">Exodus 7:16</a>, <a href="/exodus/8.htm">Exodus 8:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is demonstrating His power and sovereignty over Egypt and its gods.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader and prophet of Israel, tasked with delivering God's message to Pharaoh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened against releasing the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hebrews.htm">The Hebrews (Israelites)</a></b><br>God's chosen people, enslaved in Egypt, whom God desires to free for worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, representing a place of bondage and opposition to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control and His plans will prevail, even over the most powerful earthly rulers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_call.htm">Obedience to God's Call</a></b><br>Like Moses, we are called to be obedient to God's instructions, even when facing opposition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_of_deliverance.htm">Purpose of Deliverance</a></b><br>Understand that God's deliverance is not just for freedom's sake but for the purpose of worship and relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_hardness_of_heart.htm">The Hardness of Heart</a></b><br>Be aware of the dangers of a hardened heart and the importance of remaining open to God's voice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Trust in God's faithfulness to fulfill His promises, as demonstrated in His deliverance of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_9_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 9:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_13_God_s_rule_over_Pharaoh.htm">How does Exodus 9:13 demonstrate God's sovereignty over Pharaoh and Egypt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/God_s_purpose_for_Israel_in_Let_My_people_go.htm">What does "Let My people go" reveal about God's purpose for Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Exodus_9_13_to_our_obedience.htm">How can we apply God's command in Exodus 9:13 to our own obedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Exodus_9_13_to_Abraham_s_covenant.htm">What connections exist between Exodus 9:13 and God's covenant with Abraham?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_13_Respond_to_God_s_authority.htm">How does Exodus 9:13 challenge us to respond to God's authority today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_9_13_God_s_power_over_nations.htm">What does Exodus 9:13 reveal about God's power and authority over nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_Exodus_9_13_in_Egypt_plagues.htm">How does Exodus 9:13 fit into the narrative of the plagues in Egypt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_God_harden_Pharaoh_s_heart.htm">Why does God harden Pharaoh's heart according to Exodus 9:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_do_locusts_and_hail_plagues_align.htm">How does the destruction caused by the locusts (Exodus 10:15) align with the later plague of hail in Exodus 9, which supposedly ruined crops earlier? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_the_bible_define_fortitude.htm">How does the Bible define fortitude?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_would_god_allow_child_deaths_in_exodus.htm">(Exodus 11) How could a just and loving God sanction the killing of innocent children for Pharaoh&#8217;s stubbornness? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_evidence_supports_the_ten_plagues.htm">What evidence supports the occurrence of the Ten Plagues?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Exodus 9:13 Mean</div><b>Then the LORD said to Moses</b><p>The passage opens with God Himself initiating the conversation.

This is the first plague of the third group, and presents to us several new features. (1) It is ushered in with an unusually long and exceeding awful message (<a href="/context/exodus/9-13.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus said the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.">Exodus 9:13-19</a>), in which Pharaoh is warned that God is now about to "send <span class= "ital">all</span> His plagues <span class= "ital">upon his heart,"</span> and that he has been raised up simply that God may show forth His power in his person. (2) It is the first plague that attacks human life; and this it does upon a large scale: all those exposed to it perish (<a href="/exodus/9-19.htm" title="Send therefore now, and gather your cattle, and all that you have in the field; for on every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down on them, and they shall die.">Exodus 9:19</a>). (3) It is more destructive than any previous plague to property. It not only slays cattle, like the murrain. but destroys plants and trees (<a href="/exodus/9-25.htm" title="And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.">Exodus 9:25</a>), and ruins half the harvest (<a href="/exodus/9-31.htm" title="And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.">Exodus 9:31</a>). (4) It is accompanied with terrible demonstrations--"mighty thunderings," huge hailstones, rain, and fire that "runs along upon the ground" (<a href="/exodus/9-23.htm" title="And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along on the ground; and the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt.">Exodus 9:23</a>). (5) It is made to test the degree of faith to which the Egyptians have attained, by means of a revelation of the way whereby it may be escaped (<a href="/exodus/9-20.htm" title="He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:">Exodus 9:20</a>). Though the plagues do not form a regularly ascending series, each transcending the last, yet there is a certain progression observable. The earlier ones cause annoyance rather than injury; those which follow cause loss of property; then God's hand is laid on men's persons, so as to hurt, but not to kill; lastly, life itself is attacked. The seventh plague was peculiarly astonishing and alarming to the Egyptians, because hail and thunder, even rain, were rare phenomena in their country; and a thunderstorm accompanied by such features as characterised this one was absolutely unknown. The hailstones must have been of an enormous size and weight to kill men and cattle. The "fire infolding itself amid the hail" must indicate a very unusual form of the electric fluid. It is not surprising that the visitation brought down the pride of Pharaoh more than any preceding one, and made him for the time consent unconditionally to the people's departure (<a href="/exodus/9-28.htm" title="Entreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunder and hail; and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.">Exodus 9:28</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-26.</span> - THE SEVENTH PLAGUE. The sixth plague had had no effect at all upon the hard heart of the Pharaoh, who cared nothing for the physical sufferings of his subjects, and apparently was not himself afflicted by the malady. Moses was therefore ordered to appear before him once more, and warn him of further and yet more terrible visitations which were impending. The long message (vers. 13-19) is without any previous parallel, and contains matter calculated to make an impression even upon the most callous of mortals. First there is an announcement that God is about to send "<span class="accented">all</span> his plagues" upon king and people (ver. 14); then a solemn warning that a pestilence might have been sent which would have swept both king and people from the face of the earth (ver. 15); and finally (ver. 18) an announcement of the actual judgment immediately impending, which is to be a hailstorm of a severity never previously known in Egypt, and but rarely experienced elsewhere. Pharaoh is moreover told that the whole object of his having been allowed by God to continue in existence is the glory about to accrue to his name from the exhibition of his power in the deliverance of his people (ver. 16). A peculiar feature of the plague is the warning (ver. 19) whereby those who believed the words of Moses, were enabled to escape a great part of the ill effects of the storm. It is a remarkable indication of the impression made by the previous plagues, that the warning was taken by a considerable number of the Egyptians, who by this means saved their cattle and their slaves (ver. 20). The injury caused by the plague was very great. The flax and barley crops, which were the most advanced suffered complete destruction. Men and beasts were wounded by the hail-stones, which might have been - as hail-stones sometimes are - jagged pieces of ice; and some were even killed, either by the hail (see <a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>), or by the lightning which accompanied it. Even trees were damaged by the force of the storm, which destroyed the foliage and broke the branches. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rise up early</span>.
