In the context of the Exodus narrative, Moses serves as the mediator between God and the Israelites, a role that prefigures Christ as the ultimate mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The divine communication underscores the authority and sacredness of the message being delivered.<p><b>Write down these words</b><br>The instruction to write signifies the importance and permanence of God's covenant. Writing was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures for recording significant agreements and laws. This act of writing ensures that the covenant is preserved for future generations, similar to how the New Testament writings preserve the teachings of Jesus and the apostles.<p><b>for in accordance with these words</b><br>This phrase indicates that the covenant is based on specific stipulations and commandments. It reflects the conditional nature of many biblical covenants, where blessings are contingent upon obedience. This mirrors the New Covenant, where faith in Christ and adherence to His teachings are central (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><b>I have made a covenant with you and with Israel</b><br>The covenant is both personal and communal, involving Moses as the leader and the entire nation of Israel.

After conversing with them and with the people he resolved to "put a vail on his face" ordinarily, only taking it of[ when he "went in before the Lord" into the ,, tent of meeting," and when, having received a message from the Lord to the people, he came out to deliver it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Write thou these words</span>.
