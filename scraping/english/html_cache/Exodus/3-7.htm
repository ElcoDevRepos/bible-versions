In the context of Exodus, God is speaking to Moses from the burning bush, a theophany that signifies His presence and holiness. This encounter marks a pivotal moment in biblical history, as God reveals His plan for the deliverance of Israel.<p><b>I have indeed seen the affliction of My people in Egypt</b><br>God's awareness of Israel's suffering highlights His omniscience and compassion. The term "affliction" refers to the harsh conditions and forced labor imposed by the Egyptians. This phrase underscores God's covenant relationship with Israel, as He refers to them as "My people," recalling His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The historical context involves the Israelites' enslavement, which began after Joseph's death and the rise of a new Pharaoh who did not know Joseph (<a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8</a>).<p><b>I have heard them crying out because of their oppressors</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's attentiveness to the prayers and cries of His people. The "oppressors" are the Egyptians, who subjected the Israelites to brutal slavery. The act of crying out signifies desperation and a plea for divine intervention. This connects to other biblical instances where God responds to the cries of His people, such as in Judges during the cycles of sin and deliverance.<p><b>and I am aware of their sufferings</b><br>God's awareness of suffering is not passive; it implies a readiness to act. The term "sufferings" encompasses the physical, emotional, and spiritual distress experienced by the Israelites. This awareness is a precursor to God's redemptive action, foreshadowing the deliverance through Moses, a type of Christ who leads His people out of bondage. Theologically, this reflects God's nature as compassionate and just, aligning with His future acts of salvation through Jesus Christ, who also sees and responds to human suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who reveals Himself to Moses and expresses His concern for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader of Israel, who encounters God at the burning bush and receives his divine commission.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are suffering under the harsh oppression of Egyptian slavery.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, representing a place of bondage and suffering.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/oppressors.htm">Oppressors</a></b><br>The Egyptians, particularly Pharaoh, who impose harsh labor and suffering on the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_awareness_and_compassion.htm">God's Awareness and Compassion</a></b><br>God is not distant or indifferent to the suffering of His people.

He breaks the silence; Moses is not conjuring up a plan on his own (cf. <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>).<p>- Throughout Scripture, when God speaks, things change&#8212;<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a> &#8220;Then God said, &#8216;Let there be light,&#8217; and there was light,&#8221; and <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a> tells us His word never returns void.<p>- Because the Lord is the unchanging &#8220;I AM&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>), His spoken promise carries the same authority and reliability today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have indeed seen the affliction of My people in Egypt</b><p>- &#8220;Indeed&#8221; doubles down on certainty. God&#8217;s awareness is not casual; it is deliberate and focused (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-15</a>).<p>- Calling Israel &#8220;My people&#8221; displays covenant love first stated in <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a> and reaffirmed in <a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a> when He remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p>- He &#8220;has seen&#8221; every whip stroke and every tear, just as He saw Hagar&#8217;s distress in <a href="/genesis/16-13.htm">Genesis 16:13</a>. No hardship is hidden from His eyes (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p>- Egypt, once a place of provision (<a href="/genesis/46-3.htm">Genesis 46:3-4</a>), has become a furnace of oppression (<a href="/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13-14</a>). God is fully aware of the change in circumstances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have heard them crying out because of their oppressors</b><p>- Hearing implies relational attentiveness; God is not distant. <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-24</a> notes that their groaning &#8220;went up to God,&#8221; and here He confirms He has heard.<p>- <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a> promises, &#8220;The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears.&#8221; The pattern is consistent: God&#8217;s ear is tuned to His people&#8217;s pain (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>).<p>- &#8220;Because of their oppressors&#8221; identifies the cause; God never mistakes the source of suffering. He knows who is guilty and who is afflicted (<a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am aware of their sufferings</b><p>- The statement gathers sight and sound into personal knowledge. He is not merely informed; He is emotionally invested (<a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>).<p>- The word &#8220;aware&#8221; conveys intimate understanding, echoed in <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a> where Christ, our High Priest, is &#8220;able to sympathize with our weaknesses.&#8221;<p>- This awareness leads to action. In the very next verse He declares, &#8220;So I have come down to rescue them&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). Divine compassion always moves toward deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a> assures us that the covenant-keeping LORD sees every injustice, hears every cry, and knows every pain His people endure.
