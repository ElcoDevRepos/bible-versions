The Nile River was central to Egyptian life, providing water for drinking, agriculture, and transportation. The act of digging around the Nile suggests an attempt to find groundwater or filtered water that was not affected by the plague. This reflects the severity of the first plague, where the river turned to blood, making the water undrinkable. The Egyptians' reliance on the Nile is a testament to its importance in their society and economy, and their efforts to find water demonstrate their vulnerability when this vital resource was compromised.<p><b>because they could not drink the water from the river</b><br>The inability to drink the river water underscores the miraculous nature of the plague. The Nile, often worshipped as a deity in Egyptian culture, was rendered useless, challenging the Egyptians' religious beliefs and demonstrating the power of the God of Israel over their gods. This event is part of a series of plagues that served to show God's supremacy and to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites. The transformation of the Nile's water can be seen as a judgment against the Egyptian gods, as well as a direct challenge to Pharaoh's authority. This phrase also foreshadows the continued hardening of Pharaoh's heart, as despite the severity of the plagues, he remains obstinate. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus provides living water, contrasting with the undrinkable water of the Nile, symbolizing spiritual sustenance and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

This water is, no doubt, derived by percolation from the river; but the percolation is a slow process, and blood would scarcely percolate far. The water obtained was probably in the ground before the miracle took place, and was not made subject to it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-25.</span> - Necessity is the mother of invention. Finding the Nile water continue utterly undrinkable, the Egyptians bethought themselves of a means of obtaining water to which they never had recourse in ordinary times. This was to dig pits or wells at some distance from the river, and so obtain the moisture that lay in the ground, no doubt derived from the river originally, but already there before the change of the water into blood took place. This, it appears, remained water, and was drinkable, though probably not very agreeable, since, owing to the nitrous quality of the soil in Egypt, well-water has always a bitter and brackish taste. It sufficed, however, for drinking and culinary purposes during the "seven days" that the plague continued (ver. 25). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the Egyptians digged</span>. Not the Hebrews.

Blood would not become water by percolation through earth, as Canon Cook appears to think ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 278); but there might have been sufficient water in the ground before the plague began, to fill the wells dug, for seven days. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/7-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Egyptians</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1435;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4713.htm">Strong's 4713: </a> </span><span class="str2">Egyptian -- inhabitant of Egypt</span><br /><br /><span class="word">dug</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1447;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#7717;&#183;p&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
