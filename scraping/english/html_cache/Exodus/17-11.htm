In ancient Near Eastern cultures, raising hands was a common posture for prayer and supplication. This act signifies Moses' intercession for Israel, demonstrating the importance of spiritual leadership and reliance on divine power rather than mere human strength. The raised hands can also be seen as a type of Christ's intercession for believers, as Jesus is our mediator before God.<p><b>Israel prevailed</b><br>The success of Israel in battle is directly linked to Moses' act of intercession. This reflects the biblical principle that victory comes through faith and reliance on God. The Israelites' victory over the Amalekites is a fulfillment of God's promise to protect and deliver His people. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory believers have through Christ, who ensures spiritual triumph over sin and death.<p><b>but when he lowered them</b><br>This phrase indicates a lapse in the act of intercession, leading to a change in the battle's outcome. It underscores the necessity of persistent prayer and faith. The physical fatigue of Moses serves as a reminder of human limitations and the need for communal support in spiritual endeavors. This can be paralleled with the New Testament teaching on the importance of perseverance in prayer (<a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1</a>).<p><b>Amalek prevailed</b><br>The Amalekites were a nomadic tribe and longstanding enemies of Israel, representing opposition to God's people. Their temporary success when Moses' hands were lowered illustrates the consequences of spiritual neglect. This battle is part of a larger biblical narrative where Amalek symbolizes the forces of evil and opposition to God's purposes. The eventual defeat of Amalek is a precursor to the ultimate defeat of evil through Christ's victory on the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

Israel prevailed</span>. The elevation of Moses' hand, with the rod held in it, was an appeal to God for aid, and must be supposed to have been accompanied by fervent prayer to God, that he would help his people and give them victory over their enemies. So long as the hand was upraised, the Israelites prevailed; not because they saw it, and took it as directing them to continue the fight (Kalisch), but because God gave them strength, and vigour and courage, while Moses interceded, and left them to themselves when the intercession ceased, It may be said, that Moses might have continued to pray, though his hands were weary; but only those who have tried, know how difficult a thing it is to pray with any intensity for a continuance. Probably Moses' spiritual and physical powers collapsed together; and when he dropped his hand through physical fatigue, he rested also from his mental effort. To impress upon Israel the importance of intercessory prayer, God made success and failure alternate with its continuance and discontinuance, thus teaching his people a lesson of inestimable value. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/17-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As long as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
