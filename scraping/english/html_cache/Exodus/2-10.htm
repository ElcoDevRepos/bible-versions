This period allowed Moses to bond with his biological family and learn about his Hebrew heritage, which would later influence his identity and mission.<p><b>she brought him to Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter</b><br>Moses' mother, Jochebed, fulfilled her agreement with Pharaoh's daughter by bringing Moses to her. This act of faith and obedience highlights the providence of God in preserving Moses' life. Pharaoh's daughter, likely a member of the royal family, had the authority to adopt Moses, which would provide him with a unique position within Egyptian society.<p><b>and he became her son</b><br>Moses' adoption into the Egyptian royal family placed him in a position of privilege and education, preparing him for his future role as a leader. This adoption also fulfilled God's plan to raise a deliverer for Israel from within the house of their oppressors, showcasing God's sovereignty and wisdom.<p><b>She named him Moses</b><br>The name "Moses" is of Egyptian origin, possibly derived from the word "mose," meaning "son" or "born of."

This foreshadows Moses' future role in drawing the Israelites out of Egypt. The act of being drawn from the water also symbolizes salvation and deliverance, themes that are central to Moses' life and the Exodus narrative.

Jud. </span>ii. 9, ? 6). But nothing more seems to be intended than nature's ordinary course. The child grew and reached the time when it was usual in Egypt that children should be weaned. We have no means of determining what this time was. It may have been the completion of the first year; but more probably it was the completion of the second (<a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/7-27.htm" title="But she bowing herself toward him, laughing the cruel tyrant to scorn, spake in her country language on this manner; O my son, have pity upon me that bare thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee such three years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age, and endured the troubles of education.">2 Maccabees 7:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">She brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter.</span>--Jochebed carried out the terms of her engagement faithfully, and gave up her son to the princess at the time agreed upon.<p><span class= "bld">He became her son.</span>--Possibly by a formal act of adoption; but we have at present no evidence that adoption was an Egyptian custom.

(On the education of Moses, see Excursus II. at the end of this Book.)<p><span class= "bld">She called his name Moses.</span>--In Egyptian probably "Mesu," which is found as a name in the monuments of the nineteenth dynasty, and which is common as the latter half of a name--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Ra-mesu, Aah-mesu, Amen-mesu, &c. In ordinary use this word meant "born" and "son." (Comp. the Latin <span class= "ital">natus.</span>) It was, however, derived from an Egyptian verb, meaning "to produce," "to draw forth;" and the princess justified her imposition of the name by a reference to this etymology. Owing to the existence of a cognate verb in Hebrew, it was possible to transfer her explanation into the Hebrew language exactly and literally. The play upon words cannot be rendered in English.<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS B: ON THE EDUCATION OF MOSES (<a href="/exodus/2-10.htm" title="And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.">Exodus 2:10</a>)</span><p>Moses would be educated like the sons of princesses generally, not like those of priests, or of persons destined for the literary life. St. Stephen, when he says that Moses was "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians," does not (probably) mean more than this. The question then is, In what did the education of princes and young nobles at the time of the exodus consist?<p>It would consist, in the first place, of orthography and grammar. Moses would be taught to speak the Egyptian language, and to write it, correctly. He would probably not be taught the hieroglyphic character, the knowledge of which was reserved to the priests, but would be familiarised with the ordinary cursive writing--the hieratic, as it was called in later times--which was the common character for books, and even for official documents, in his day. Care would be taken to instruct him in the graces of style, so far as they were understood at the time; and he would be especially practised in epistolary correspondence, which was regarded as one of the most necessary of all gentlemanlike accomplishments. Whether his attention would be turned to poetry, might perhaps be doubtful;<span class= "note">[113]</span> but he would certainly be taught a clear and perspicuous prose style, such as was required for official reports and other communications between members of the governing class.<p><span class= "note">[113] The poetry of Moses his "songs" (</span><a href="/context/exodus/15-1.htm" title="Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.">Exodus 15:1-19</a><span class= "note">; </span><a href="/context/deuteronomy/32-1.htm" title="Give ear, O you heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.">Deuteronomy 32:1-43</a><span class= "note">), his "blessing" (Deut.

Compare <a href="/genesis/21-8.htm">Genesis 21:8</a>, where the full phrase is used - "The child grew, <span class="accented">and was weaned."</span> Jocbebed had saved her son's life by a transfer of her mother's right in him to Pharaoh's daughter. She had received him back, merely as a hired nurse, to suckle him. When the time came, probably at the end of the second year, for him to be weaned, she was bound, whatever the sufferings of her heart may have been, to give him up - to restore him to her from whom she had received him, as a child put out to nurse. And we see that she made no attempt to escape her obligations. No sooner was the boy weaned, than "<span class="cmt_word">she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter"</span> - as it would seem, of her own accord. <span class="cmt_word">And he became her son</span>. There is no evidence that formal "adoption" was a custom of the Egyptians; and probably no more is here meant than that the princess took the child into her family, and brought him up as if he had been her son, giving him all the privileges of a son, together with such an education as a princess's son usually received. We obtain the best general idea of what such an education was from the words of St. Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-21.htm">Acts 7:21</a>) - "Now Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians." This "wisdom," though not perhaps very deep, was multiform and manifold. It included orthography, grammar, history, theology, medicine, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and engineering. Education began, as in most countries, with orthography and grammar. The hieroglyphical system was probably not taught, and the knowledge of it remained a special privilege of the priest-class: but the cursive character, known as the hieratic, was generally studied, and all tolerably educated persons could read it and write it. Style was cultivated, and though no great progress was made in the graces of finished composition, the power of expressing thought and relating facts in a simple and perspicuous prose was acquired by the greater number. Much attention was paid to letter-writing; and models of business and other letters were set before the pupil as patterns which he was to follow. By the more advanced, poetry was read, and poetic composition occasionally practised. Arithmetic and geometry, up to a certain point, were studied by all; and a plain morality was inculcated. But history, theology, astronomy, medicine, and engineering, were viewed as special studies, to be pursued by those intended for certain professions, rather than as included within the curriculum of an ordinary education; and it may well be doubted whether Moses' attention was much directed to any of them. He may indeed have been initiated into the mysteries, and in that case would have come to understand the esoteric meaning of the Egyptian myths, and of all that most revolts moderns in the Egyptian religion. But, on the whole, it is most probable that he was rather trained for active than for speculative life, and received the education which fitted men for the service of the State, not that which made them dreamers and theorists. His great praise is, that "he was mighty in words and deeds "(Acts, <span class="accented">1.s.c.</span>); and he was certainly anything rather than a recluse student. We should do wrong to regard him as either a scientific man or a philosopher. His genius was practical; and his education was of a practical kind - such as fitted him to become the leader of his people in a great emergency, to deal on equal terms with a powerful monarch, and to guide to a happy conclusion the hazardous enterprise of a great national migration. <span class="cmt_word">And she called his name Moses</span>. The Egyptian form of the name was probably Mesu, which signifies "born, brought forth, child," and is derived from a root meaning "to produce," "draw forth." Egyptian has many roots common to it with Hebrew, whereof this is one.
