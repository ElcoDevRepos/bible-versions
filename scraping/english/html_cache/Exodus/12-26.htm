In the ancient Near Eastern context, oral tradition was a primary means of education. The question from children signifies curiosity and a desire to understand their heritage, which is a common theme in the Bible (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-20.htm">Deuteronomy 6:20</a>). It underscores the role of parents as spiritual educators, a principle echoed in <a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>.<p><b>&#8216;What does this service mean to you?&#8217;</b><br>The "service" refers to the Passover, a pivotal event in Israel's history commemorating their deliverance from Egyptian bondage. This question invites reflection on the significance of the Passover, which is both a historical remembrance and a spiritual symbol. The Passover lamb is a type of Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>, where Paul refers to Jesus as "our Passover lamb." The inquiry encourages a personal connection to the ritual, ensuring that the observance is not merely a tradition but a meaningful act of worship. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of remembrance and the importance of understanding God's redemptive acts (<a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.
