Moses and Aaron, as God's appointed leaders, often confronted Pharaoh to demand the release of the Israelites. Their departure signifies a temporary end to direct negotiation, highlighting the ongoing struggle between God's will and Pharaoh's resistance. This pattern of confrontation and withdrawal is seen throughout the plagues narrative, emphasizing the hardening of Pharaoh's heart and the persistence of God's messengers.<p><b>Moses cried out to the LORD</b><br>Moses' action of crying out to the LORD demonstrates his role as an intercessor for the people. This act of prayer reflects a deep reliance on God for intervention and deliverance. It also underscores the personal relationship Moses had with God, characterized by direct communication and trust. This intercession is a recurring theme in Moses' leadership, as seen in other instances such as <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>, where he pleads for the Israelites after the golden calf incident.<p><b>for help with the frogs</b><br>The plague of frogs was the second of the ten plagues sent upon Egypt. Frogs were considered sacred in Egyptian culture, associated with the goddess Heqet, who was linked to fertility and childbirth. The infestation of frogs, therefore, not only caused physical discomfort but also challenged the religious beliefs of the Egyptians. Moses' plea for help signifies the need for divine intervention to remove the plague, demonstrating God's power over Egyptian deities and the natural world.<p><b>that He had brought against Pharaoh</b><br>This phrase highlights God's sovereignty and direct involvement in the events unfolding in Egypt. The plagues were not random occurrences but were specifically orchestrated by God to demonstrate His power and to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites. Each plague targeted specific aspects of Egyptian life and belief, serving as a judgment against their gods and a sign of God's supremacy. This divine orchestration is a central theme in the Exodus narrative, illustrating God's control over history and His commitment to His covenant people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.
