The "next day" suggests a deliberate and planned action, not a spontaneous event. It reflects the people's eagerness to engage in idolatrous practices, contrasting with the patience required to wait for Moses' return from Mount Sinai.<p><b>offered burnt offerings</b><br>Burnt offerings were a common form of sacrifice in ancient Israel, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. However, in this context, the offerings were made to the golden calf, representing a grave departure from the worship of Yahweh. This act of offering sacrifices to an idol highlights the Israelites' misunderstanding and misapplication of sacrificial practices meant for the true God.<p><b>and presented peace offerings</b><br>Peace offerings, or fellowship offerings, were meant to symbolize reconciliation and thanksgiving to God. The presentation of peace offerings to the calf further underscores the Israelites' misguided attempt to replicate legitimate worship practices in an idolatrous context. This act reveals a distortion of true worship and a breach of the covenant relationship with God.<p><b>And the people sat down to eat and drink</b><br>This phrase suggests a communal meal, which was often part of sacrificial rituals. However, in this instance, it signifies a descent into pagan practices, as eating and drinking were associated with idolatrous feasts in the ancient Near East. The act of sitting down to eat and drink in this context indicates a false sense of security and satisfaction derived from their idolatry.<p><b>and got up to indulge in revelry</b><br>The term "revelry" implies not just celebration but also immoral and licentious behavior. This behavior is reminiscent of pagan worship practices, which often included excessive drinking and sexual immorality. The Israelites' actions here are a direct violation of the commandments given by God, particularly the first and second commandments. This revelry is a stark contrast to the holiness and order expected in worshiping Yahweh, and it foreshadows the severe consequences that follow.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is on Mount Sinai receiving the Ten Commandments from God during this event.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and the high priest, who is left in charge of the people and plays a key role in the creation of the golden calf.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who have been delivered from Egypt and are now in the wilderness.

In feasting therefore upon what they had offered, the Israelites did no wrong; but probably they indulged themselves in a license of feasting unsuited to a religious act, though common enough in the idol-festivals of the heathen. They "fed without fear" (<a href="/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>), transgressed the bounds of moderation, and turned what should have been a religious rite into an orgy. Then, having gratified their appetites and stimulated their passions, they ceased to eat and drink, and "rose up to play." The "play" included dancing of an indecent kind (<a href="/exodus/32-19.htm" title="And it came to pass, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount.">Exodus 32:19</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-25.htm" title="And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked to their shame among their enemies:)">Exodus 32:25</a>), and would probably have terminated, as the heathen orgies too often did, in the grossest sensualism, had not the descent of Moses from Sinai, and his appearance on the scene, put a stop to the unhallowed doings. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They rose up early on the morrow</span>.

It is evident that both of these were customary forms of sacrifice - neither of them first introduced by the Law, which had not - except so far as the "Book of the Covenant" was concerned - been promulgated.
