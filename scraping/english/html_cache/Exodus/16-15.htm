This moment occurs shortly after their deliverance from slavery, highlighting their dependence on God for sustenance. The wilderness setting underscores the miraculous nature of God's provision.<p><b>they asked one another, &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</b><br>The Hebrew word for "What is it?" is "manna," which became the name for this miraculous food. This question reflects their unfamiliarity with God's provision, symbolizing a lack of understanding of His ways. It also indicates their initial doubt and confusion, a recurring theme in their wilderness journey.<p><b>For they did not know what it was.</b><br>This lack of recognition points to the newness of God's provision and the Israelites' need to trust in His guidance. It also foreshadows their ongoing struggle with faith and obedience. The manna was unlike anything they had experienced, emphasizing God's ability to provide in unexpected ways.<p><b>So Moses told them,</b><br>Moses, as the leader and mediator between God and the people, plays a crucial role in communicating God's instructions. His leadership is essential in guiding the Israelites to understand and accept God's provision. This moment reinforces Moses' position as a prophet and teacher.<p><b>&#8220;It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat.&#8221;</b><br>This statement identifies the manna as a divine gift, emphasizing God's grace and provision. The bread from heaven is a type of Christ, who later identifies Himself as the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32-35</a>). This connection highlights the continuity of God's salvation plan and the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus.

Or, as by Kimchi, Knobel, Gesenius, Kurtz, and others, "This is a gift." It is against the former rendering that <span class= "ital">man </span>does not mean "what" in Hebrew, but only in Chaldee, and that "what is this" would be a very strange name to give to a substance. Against the latter it may be said that neither is <span class= "ital">man </span>found elsewhere in Hebrew in the sense of "a gift;" but it has that sense in Arabic; and in Hebrew <span class= "ital">manan </span>is "to give."<p><span class= "bld">This is the bread</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., the promised bread. </span>(See <a href="/exodus/16-4.htm" title="Then said the LORD to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.">Exodus 16:4</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They said one to another, this is manna</span>. Rather, "this is a gift." To suppose that they recognised the substance as one known to them in Egypt under the name of menu or mennu, is to make this clause contradict the next. To translate "what is this?" gives good sense, but is against grammar, since the Hebrew for "what" is not <span class="accented">man</span> but <span class="accented">mah</span>. The Septuagint translators (who render <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) were probably deceived by their familiarity with the Chaldee, in which man corresponds to "what." Not knowing what to call the substance, the Israelites said one to another, "it is a gift" - meaning a gift from heaven, God's gift (compare verse 8); and afterwards, in consequence of this, the word man (properly "gift") became the accepted name of the thing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/16-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw it,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yir&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
