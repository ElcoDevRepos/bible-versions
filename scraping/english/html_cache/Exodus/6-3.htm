The appearances to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are foundational events in the biblical narrative, establishing the covenantal promises that would shape the history of Israel. These appearances are recorded in Genesis, where God communicates His promises of land, descendants, and blessing. The patriarchs' experiences with God set a precedent for faith and obedience, serving as examples for future generations. The personal nature of these encounters underscores God's desire for a relationship with His people.<p><b>as God Almighty</b><br>The name "God Almighty" is translated from the Hebrew "El Shaddai." This title emphasizes God's supreme power and sufficiency. It is first used in <a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17:1</a> when God establishes His covenant with Abraham, promising to make him the father of many nations. The use of "El Shaddai" conveys God's ability to fulfill His promises despite human limitations. It reassures the patriarchs of God's omnipotence and faithfulness, providing them with confidence in His divine plan. This title is significant in understanding God's character and His interactions with humanity.<p><b>but by My name the LORD</b><br>The name "LORD" is translated from the Hebrew "YHWH," often vocalized as "Yahweh." This name is considered the personal and covenantal name of God, signifying His eternal existence and unchanging nature. While the patriarchs were aware of God's power as "El Shaddai," the revelation of "YHWH" marks a deeper understanding of His identity and relationship with Israel. This name is central to the covenant at Sinai and is associated with God's deliverance and faithfulness. It is a name that signifies intimacy and commitment, reflecting God's ongoing presence with His people.<p><b>I did not make Myself known to them</b><br>This statement indicates a progressive revelation of God's character and purposes. While the patriarchs experienced God's power and promises, the full significance of His name "YHWH" was not yet revealed to them. This revelation becomes more explicit with Moses and the Exodus, where God demonstrates His power and faithfulness in delivering Israel from Egypt. The unfolding of God's name and character throughout the biblical narrative illustrates His desire to be known by His people and to establish a covenant relationship with them. This progressive revelation is a key theme in understanding the development of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, revealing His nature and character to Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham,_isaac,_and_jacob.htm">Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarchs of Israel to whom God appeared as "God Almighty" (El Shaddai).<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, receiving this revelation from God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites are enslaved and from where God plans to deliver them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>The ongoing promise God made with the patriarchs, which He is now fulfilling through Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_names.htm">Understanding God's Names</a></b><br>The names of God reveal different aspects of His character.

It is used by Isaac (<a href="/genesis/28-3.htm" title="And God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a multitude of people;">Genesis 28:3</a>), and repeated in the revelation made to Jacob (<a href="/genesis/35-11.htm" title="And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of you, and kings shall come out of your loins;">Genesis 35:11</a> ). Its primary idea is, no doubt, that of "overpowering strength." (See the comment on <a href="/genesis/17-1.htm" title="And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be you perfect.">Genesis 17:1</a>.) The primary idea of "Jehovah" is, on the contrary, that of absolute, eternal, unconditional, independent existence. Both names were probably of a great antiquity, and widely spread among Semitic races; but, at different times and in different places, special stress was laid on the one or on the other. To the early patriarchs God revealed Himself as "El Shaddai," because He desired to impress upon them His ability to fulfil the promises which He had made to them; to Moses and Israel generally, at the date of the Exodus, He insisted on His name Jehovah, because they were in the closest contact with polytheism, and had themselves, in many cases, fallen into polytheism (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm" title="Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD.">Joshua 24:14</a>), against which this Name was a standing protest, since "the Existent" must mean "the Self Existent," and so "the Only Existent." (See <a href="/deuteronomy/4-39.htm" title="Know therefore this day, and consider it in your heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath: there is none else.">Deuteronomy 4:39</a> : "Jehovah, he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: <span class= "ital">there is none else"</span>) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty</span>. See <a href="/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a> for the revelation of this name to Abraham, and <a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a> for its repetition to Jacob. We do not find the full name used by God in any appearance to Isaac; but Isaac himself uses it in <a href="/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">By my name Jehovah was</span> <span class="cmt_word">I not known unto them</span>. The explanation of this passage is by no means easy. God himself, according to <a href="/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>, revealed himself to Abraham as Jehovah before declaring his name to be El-Shaddai (God Almighty); and again revealed himself to Jacob as Jehovah-Elohim (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>). Abraham named the place where he had been about to sacrifice Isaac, "Jehovah-jireh" (<a href="/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>). That Moses regarded the name as known even earlier, appears from <a href="/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1</a>. It was probably as old as language. The apparent meaning of the present passage cannot therefore be its true meaning. No writer would so contradict himself. Perhaps the true sense is, "I was known to them as a Being of might and power, not as mere absolute (and so eternal and immutable) existence." This meaning of the word, though its etymological and original meaning, may have been unknown to the patriarchs, who were not etymologists. It was first distinctly declared to Moses at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14, 15</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I appeared</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
