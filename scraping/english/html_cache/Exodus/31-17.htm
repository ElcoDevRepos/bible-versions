The "sign" refers to the Sabbath, which serves as a perpetual reminder of God's creation and His special relationship with Israel. The concept of a sign is significant in biblical covenants, as seen with the rainbow in <a href="/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12-17</a>, marking God's promise to Noah. The Sabbath as a sign underscores the distinct identity of Israel as God's chosen people, setting them apart from other nations. This perpetual sign is a testament to the enduring nature of God's promises and His faithfulness to His covenant people.<p><b>for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth,</b><br>This phrase affirms the biblical account of creation as described in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. It underscores the belief in a literal six-day creation period, which is foundational to understanding the Sabbath. The reference to creation highlights God's sovereignty and power as the Creator of all things. It also establishes a pattern for human work and rest, reflecting God's own work in creation. The six-day creation is a cornerstone of biblical theology, affirming the intentional and purposeful act of God in bringing the universe into existence.<p><b>but on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The seventh day, the Sabbath, is a day of rest, mirroring God's rest after creation. This rest is not due to fatigue but signifies completion and satisfaction in His work. The concept of rest is deeply rooted in the Hebrew word "Shabbat," meaning to cease or desist. The idea of God being "refreshed" is anthropomorphic, conveying the completeness and perfection of creation. This rest serves as a model for humanity, emphasizing the importance of rest and worship. The Sabbath rest also foreshadows the ultimate rest found in Jesus Christ, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>, where believers enter into God's rest through faith in Christ's finished work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and His role as the Creator.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavens_and_the_earth.htm">Heavens and the Earth</a></b><br>Refers to the entirety of creation, highlighting God's sovereignty and power in creating all things.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/six_days_of_creation.htm">Six Days of Creation</a></b><br>The period during which God created the universe, as described in <a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seventh_day.htm">The Seventh Day</a></b><br>The day God rested, establishing the pattern for the Sabbath.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath_rest.htm">Sabbath Rest</a></b><br>A day of rest instituted by God, serving as a sign of the covenant between Him and His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_rest.htm">The Importance of Rest</a></b><br>God Himself rested, setting an example for us to follow.

God established a weekly, perpetual sign to remind His people that:<p>&#8226; He alone is Creator, completing the universe in six literal days.<p>&#8226; They belong exclusively to Him, set apart from the nations.<p>&#8226; Rest is His gracious gift, offering delight and refreshment now and foreshadowing eternal rest in His presence. Keeping the Sabbath, therefore, is less about rule-keeping and more about relationship-keeping&#8212;honoring the God who both worked and rested for our good and His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</span>.--Whatever other grounds there were for Sabbath observance, this idea always lay at its root. Man was through it to be made like unto his Maker--to have from time to time a rest from his labours, as God had had (<a href="/context/genesis/2-2.htm" title="And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.">Genesis 2:2-3</a>)--and thereby to realise the blessedness of that final rest which he may be sure "remaineth for the people of God."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is a sign</span>. See above, ver. 13. <span class="cmt_word">For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</span>. See the comment on Exodus 20:11. <span class="cmt_word">And was refreshed</span>. Literally," and took breath." The metaphor is a bold one, but not bolder than others which occur in holy scripture (<a href="/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-65.htm">Psalm 78:65</a>). It does but carry out a little further the idea implied in God's "resting." We cannot speak of any of God's acts or attributes without anthropomorphisms. <p> CHAPTER 31:18 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/31-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">It</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1430;&#1493;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a sign</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_226.htm">Strong's 226: </a> </span><span class="str2">A signal, as a, flag, beacon, monument, omen, prodigy, evidence</span><br /><br /><span class="word">between</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
