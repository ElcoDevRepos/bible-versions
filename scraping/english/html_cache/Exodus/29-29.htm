These garments symbolized holiness and the unique role of the high priest in mediating between God and the Israelites. The materials and colors used, such as gold, blue, purple, and scarlet, were significant, representing royalty, divinity, and sacrifice. The garments included the ephod, breastplate, robe, tunic, turban, and sash, each with its own symbolic meaning and function.<p><b>will belong to his sons after him</b><br>The transfer of the holy garments to Aaron's sons signifies the continuation of the priestly lineage. This hereditary priesthood was established to maintain the sanctity and order of worship in Israel. The sons of Aaron, the Levites, were set apart for service in the tabernacle, and later the temple, ensuring that the priestly duties were carried out according to divine ordinance. This continuity underscores the importance of generational faithfulness and obedience to God's commands.<p><b>so they can be anointed and ordained in them</b><br>Anointing and ordination were essential rites for consecrating the priests. Anointing with oil symbolized the Holy Spirit's empowerment and setting apart for God's service (<a href="/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>). The ordination process involved sacrifices and rituals that purified and sanctified the priests, enabling them to serve in the holy presence of God.
