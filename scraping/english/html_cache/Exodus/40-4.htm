This table was made of acacia wood and overlaid with pure gold, symbolizing purity and divinity. The table held the Bread of the Presence, which represented God's provision and fellowship with His people. In a broader biblical context, the table signifies God's sustenance and the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The table's placement in the Tabernacle underscores the importance of worship and communion with God.<p><b>and set out its arrangement;</b><br>The arrangement refers to the specific placement of the twelve loaves of bread on the table, which were to be set in two rows of six. This arrangement was not arbitrary but followed divine instructions, symbolizing the twelve tribes of Israel and God's continual provision for them. The bread was replaced every Sabbath, and the old bread was consumed by the priests, indicating a perpetual covenant and the sustenance provided by God. This practice foreshadows the spiritual nourishment provided by Christ, who is the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>bring in the lampstand as well,</b><br>The lampstand, or menorah, was also made of pure gold and was placed opposite the table in the Holy Place. It had seven branches and was designed to provide light within the Tabernacle. The lampstand symbolizes the light of God's presence and guidance. In the New Testament, Jesus refers to Himself as the "light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), drawing a parallel to the lampstand's function in the Tabernacle. The continual burning of the lamps signifies the perpetual presence and illumination of God among His people.<p><b>and set up its lamps.</b><br>Setting up the lamps involved ensuring they were filled with pure olive oil and trimmed to burn brightly. This task was the responsibility of the priests and was to be done regularly, emphasizing the need for constant vigilance and care in maintaining the light. The lamps' light represents the guidance and revelation of God, illuminating the path for His people. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's word is described as a "lamp to my feet and a light to my path." The maintenance of the lamps also points to the believer's responsibility to remain spiritually vigilant and filled with the Holy Spirit, who empowers and enlightens.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and to receive the Law.
