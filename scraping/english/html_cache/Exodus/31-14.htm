The Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between God and Israel, emphasizing rest and holiness. It serves as a reminder of God's creation and deliverance from Egypt (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>). The holiness of the Sabbath underscores its separation from ordinary days, calling for a cessation of work to focus on spiritual renewal and worship. The Sabbath is a type of the rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>), pointing to the ultimate rest believers have in Him.<p><b>Anyone who profanes it must surely be put to death.</b><br>The severe penalty for profaning the Sabbath highlights its importance in the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Profaning the Sabbath meant treating it as common, disregarding its sanctity. This command reflects the seriousness of maintaining the community's holiness and obedience to God's law. The death penalty underscores the gravity of disobedience and the need for communal purity. In the New Testament, while the specific penalty is not carried over, the principle of honoring God's commands remains (<a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-17</a>).<p><b>Whoever does any work on that day must be cut off from among his people.</b><br>The prohibition against work on the Sabbath is a call to trust in God's provision and to prioritize spiritual over material concerns. Being "cut off" implies a form of excommunication or separation from the covenant community, emphasizing the communal aspect of obedience. This phrase indicates the social and spiritual consequences of disobedience, reinforcing the idea that the Sabbath is a communal observance. The New Testament reflects a shift from legalistic observance to understanding the Sabbath's purpose in Christ (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27-28</a>), who fulfills the law and offers rest to His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the law from God on Mount Sinai, including the commandment to keep the Sabbath holy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given the command to observe the Sabbath as a sign of their covenant with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God delivered the Ten Commandments and other laws to Moses, including the Sabbath commandment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sabbath.htm">The Sabbath</a></b><br>A day of rest on the seventh day, instituted by God as a holy day for the Israelites to cease from work and remember their covenant with Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who established the Sabbath as a perpetual covenant and a sign of sanctification for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_the_sabbath.htm">The Holiness of the Sabbath</a></b><br>The Sabbath is set apart as holy, a day dedicated to God.

While Christ fulfills the law and its penalties, the heart of the command endures: God&#8217;s people are called to set apart regular, devoted time for worship, rest, and remembrance of His saving work. Honoring that rhythm affirms His lordship, nourishes our souls, and strengthens our community in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death.</span>--This is a new enactment, and must be regarded in conjunction with the new dignity attached to Sabbath observance by its having become the special covenant sign between God and His people. The Sabbath-breaker now threw himself out of covenant with God, and not only so, but did what in him lay to throw the whole people out of covenant. His guilt was therefore great, and the assignment to it of the death-penalty is in no way surprising; rather, it is in accordance with the general spirit of the code (see <a href="/context/exodus/21-16.htm" title="And he that steals a man, and sells him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.">Exodus 21:16-17</a>; <a href="/exodus/21-29.htm" title="But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it has been testified to his owner, and he has not kept him in, but that he has killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.">Exodus 21:29</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/22-18.htm" title="You shall not suffer a witch to live.">Exodus 22:18-20</a>, &c.). When the occasion arose, there was no hesitation in carrying the law out (<a href="/context/numbers/15-32.htm" title="And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks on the sabbath day.">Numbers 15:32-35</a>).<p>Cut off.--Or, <span class= "ital">separated, set apart from. </span>His act at once cast him out from the number of God's people, made him an outlaw, <span class= "ital">ipso facto </span>excommunicated him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death</span>. To defile the sabbath was to do any unnecessary servile work upon it. Works of mercy, works of necessity, and works connected with religious observance were not prohibited. (See <a href="/matthew/12-1.htm">Matthew 12:1-7</a>; <a href="/matthew/10.htm">Matthew 10-12</a>.) The penalty of death for breaking the sabbath seems to moderns over-severe; but the erection of sabbath-observance into <span class="accented">the</span> special sacramental sign that Israel was in covenant with God made non-observance an offence of the gravest character. The man who broke the sabbath destroyed, so far as in him lay, the entire covenant between God and his people - not only broke it, but annulled it, and threw Israel out of covenant. Hence, when the sin was committed, no hesitation was felt in carrying out the law.
