In the ancient Near Eastern context, blood was often associated with covenant and purification. This act prefigures the sacrificial system established later in the Mosaic Law and ultimately points to the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, whose blood brings redemption (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><b>and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes</b><br>The application of blood on the doorframes served as a sign of protection and obedience. The doorframe, being the entrance to the home, symbolized the threshold between life and death. This act of marking the doorposts with blood was a public declaration of faith and trust in God's promise of deliverance. It parallels the concept of being marked or sealed by God, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/9-4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4</a> and <a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>.<p><b>of the houses</b><br>The house represents the family unit, which was central to Israelite society. The communal aspect of the Passover meal highlights the importance of family and community in worship and obedience to God. This also foreshadows the New Testament concept of the household of faith (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>).<p><b>where they eat the lambs</b><br>Eating the lamb was an integral part of the Passover celebration, signifying participation in the covenant and the sustenance provided by God. The lamb, without blemish, is a type of Christ, who is sinless and provides spiritual nourishment to believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>, <a href="/john/6-53.htm">John 6:53-56</a>).

The sight of the bloody stains above the door and on either side would prevent its entering. The word translated "upper door post" appears to be derived from <span class= "ital">shacaph,</span> "to look out," and to signify properly the latticed window above the door, through which persons reconnoitred those who knocked before admitting them. Such windows are frequently represented in the early Egyptian monuments. The blood thus rendered conspicuous would show that atonement had been made for the house, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> for its inmates.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall take of the blood</span>. The blood, which, according to Hebrew ideas, "is the life," and so the very essence of the sacrifice, was always regarded as the special symbol of that expiation and atonement, with a view to which sacrifice was instituted. As by the Paschal sacrifice atonement was made for the <span class="accented">house</span>, which was therefore to escape unscathed, the sign of atonement was to be conspicuously placed upon it. <span class="cmt_word">And strike</span>. The "striking" was to be by means of a bunch of hyssop dipped in the blood (ver. 22). The selection of the doorway as the part of the house to receive the stains of blood is probably to be connected with the idea that the secondary agency producing death, whatever it was, would enter by the door - and if the door showed the house to have been atoned for, would not enter. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">upper door-past</span>. The word used is elsewhere translated "lintel" (<a href="/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22, 23</a>); but it seems properly to mean the latticed window which was commonly placed over a doorway in Egyptian houses, and which is often represented in the facades of tombs. (See Lepsius, <span class="accented">Denkmaler</span>, pt. 2. pls. 16,17, 147, etc.) It is derived from a root signifying "to look out." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/12-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They are to take</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1469;&#1511;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;q&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
