Chariots were the most advanced military technology of the time, symbolizing power and speed. This reflects Egypt's status as a dominant ancient power. The "best chariots" suggests elite units, possibly manned by experienced soldiers, highlighting the seriousness of Pharaoh's pursuit. In biblical context, chariots often symbolize human strength and reliance on military might, contrasting with Israel's reliance on God (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><b>and all the other chariots of Egypt</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the total mobilization of Egypt's military resources. It suggests a comprehensive effort to ensure the Israelites' return, indicating Pharaoh's desperation and anger. The inclusion of "all the other chariots" underscores the scale of the operation, showing that Pharaoh spared no effort. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of God's power to overcome even the greatest human forces, as later demonstrated in the Red Sea crossing.<p><b>with officers over all of them</b><br>The presence of officers indicates a well-organized military campaign, with leadership and strategy in place. This structure reflects the Egyptian military's sophistication and Pharaoh's intent to exert control and authority. The officers' role was to maintain order and execute Pharaoh's commands, highlighting the disciplined nature of the Egyptian army. This organization contrasts with the seemingly vulnerable position of the Israelites, who were led by Moses under God's guidance. The mention of officers also sets the stage for the miraculous defeat of this formidable force, showcasing God's supremacy over human leadership and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who hardened his heart against letting the Israelites go, leading to the pursuit of the Israelites with his army.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and from which they were being delivered by God through Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/chariots.htm">Chariots</a></b><br>Representing the military strength and technological advantage of Egypt, used by Pharaoh to pursue the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/officers.htm">Officers</a></b><br>Military leaders appointed over the chariots, indicating a well-organized and formidable force.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Moses, fleeing from Egyptian bondage towards the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reliance_on_human_strength_vs._divine_power.htm">Reliance on Human Strength vs. Divine Power</a></b><br>The Egyptians relied on their military might, but God demonstrated His superior power.

Consider:<p>&#8226; Elite forces: like Sisera&#8217;s 900 iron chariots in <a href="/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a> or Shishak&#8217;s 1,200 in <a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>, these represent state-of-the-art weaponry.<p>&#8226; Confidence in military technology: <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a> warns those &#8220;who rely on chariots,&#8221; highlighting the same misplaced trust.<p>&#8226; A complete commitment: Pharaoh is not holding back reserves; he stakes his finest troops on recapturing Israel.<p>The figure is literal, reminding us that God confronts tangible, earthly power with His own superior might (<a href="/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the other chariots of Egypt</b><p>Beyond the 600 elites, every remaining chariot rolls out. <a href="/exodus/14-9.htm">Exodus 14:9</a> repeats, &#8220;all Pharaoh&#8217;s horses, chariots, horsemen, and army.&#8221; This communicates:<p>&#8226; Total mobilization&#8212;no partial effort, no plan B.<p>&#8226; National pride: Egypt&#8217;s famed chariot corps (<a href="/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28-29</a>) now stands against the LORD.<p>&#8226; A dramatic contrast to Israel, weaponless and hemmed in (<a href="/exodus/14-10.htm">Exodus 14:10-12</a>).<p>The comprehensive scope magnifies the miracle that none of these formidable units survive the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15-19.htm">Exodus 15:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with officers over all of them</b><p>Military hierarchy accompanies the hardware.

The verse highlights human power at its peak, setting the stage for God to demonstrate that no weapon, number, or leader can thwart His salvation.

Diodorus Siculus assigns to his Sesostris (probably Rameses II.) a force of 27,000 chariots; but this is, no doubt, an exaggeration. The largest number of chariots brought together on any one occasion that is <span class= "ital">sufficiently attested,</span> is believed by the present writer to be 3,940, which were collected by various confederates against an Assyrian king (<span class= "ital">Ancient Monarchies,</span> vol. ii, p. 103, Note). In <a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm" title="And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.">1Samuel 13:5</a>, 30,000 chariots are mentioned, no doubt by some numerical error. A force of 2,500 is said by Rameses II. to have been brought against him in his great Hittite campaign (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past,</span> vol. ii., pp. 69, 71). Sheshonk I. (Shishak) invaded Judaea with 1,200 (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm" title="With twelve hundred chariots, and three score thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.">2Chronicles 12:3</a>). The "six hundred <span class= "ital">chosen</span> chariots" of the present passage are thus quite within the limits of probability. Most likely they constituted a division of the royal guard, and were thus always at the king's disposal.<p><span class= "bld">And all the chariots of Egypt.</span>--The word "all" must not be pressed. The writer means "all that were available--that could be readily summoned." These could only be the chariots of Lower Egypt--those stationed at Memphis, Heliopolis, Bubastis, Pithom, Sebennytus perhaps, and Pelusium. They would probably amount to several hundreds.<p><span class= "bld">Captains over every one of them.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">over the whole of them.</span> These "captains" are again mentioned in <a href="/exodus/15-4.htm" title="Pharaoh's chariots and his host has he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.">Exodus 15:4</a>. The word in the original--a derivative from the numeral three--is supposed to have meant, primarily, "persons occupying the third rank below the king."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Six hundred chosen chariots</span>. Diodorus Siculus assigns to one Egyptian king a force of 27,000 chariots (1. 54, &sect; 4), which however is probably beyond the truth. But the 1200 assigned to Shishak (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>) may well be regarded as historical; and the great kings of the nineteenth dynasty would possess at least an equal number. The "six hundred chosen chariots" set in motion on this occasion probably constituted a division of the royal body-guard (Herod. 2:168). The remaining force would be collected from the neighbouring cities of Northern Egypt, as Memphis, Heliopolis, Bubastis, Pithom, and Pelusium. <span class="cmt_word">Captains over every one of them</span>. Rather, "Captains over the whole of them." So the LXX. the Vulgate and Syriac version.
