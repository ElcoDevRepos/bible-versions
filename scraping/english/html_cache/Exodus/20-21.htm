The distance signifies the separation between a holy God and sinful humanity, a recurring theme throughout Scripture. This separation is also seen in the structure of the Tabernacle and later the Temple, where only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies once a year. The people's fear is a reminder of the awe and respect due to God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge."<p><b>as Moses approached</b><br>Moses acts as a mediator between God and the people, a role that foreshadows the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ. In <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, Christ is described as the one mediator between God and humanity. Moses' approach signifies his unique relationship with God, as he is called a friend of God in <a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>. This approach also demonstrates Moses' faith and obedience, qualities that are essential for leadership and service to God.<p><b>the thick darkness</b><br>The thick darkness represents the mystery and majesty of God's presence. Darkness often symbolizes God's inscrutability and the limits of human understanding, as seen in <a href="/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>, "Clouds and thick darkness surround Him." This imagery is consistent with other theophanies in the Bible, such as the cloud on Mount Sinai and the darkness at the crucifixion of Christ (<a href="/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45</a>). The darkness also serves as a protective barrier, shielding the people from the full glory of God, which no one can see and live (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>).<p><b>where God was</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the reality of God's presence with His people, despite the barriers of sin and fear. God's presence is central to the covenant relationship with Israel, as He promises to dwell among them (<a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45-46</a>). The presence of God in the thick darkness also points to the incarnation of Christ, where God dwells among humanity in the person of Jesus (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). This presence is both comforting and awe-inspiring, reminding believers of God's immanence and transcendence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to receive the Law on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who were delivered from Egypt and were now at Mount Sinai to receive God's commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/thick_darkness.htm">Thick Darkness</a></b><br>Represents the presence of God on Mount Sinai, a manifestation of His divine majesty and holiness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Almighty, who is revealing His Law to Moses and establishing a covenant with the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses, a significant location for the Israelites' covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_holiness.htm">Reverence for God's Holiness</a></b><br>The Israelites' distance from the thick darkness signifies a deep reverence for God's holiness.

God&#8217;s holiness is not casual; even New Testament believers are urged, &#8220;Let us offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as Moses approached</b><p>Moses alone steps forward&#8212;already identified by God in <a href="/exodus/19-3.htm">Exodus 19:3-6</a> as the covenant mediator.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1-2</a> will repeat this solitary ascent, underscoring Moses&#8217; unique role.<p>&#8226; His approach foreshadows the greater Mediator, Jesus, who &#8220;entered the Most Holy Place once for all&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern: people remain back, mediator draws near, covenant is confirmed.
