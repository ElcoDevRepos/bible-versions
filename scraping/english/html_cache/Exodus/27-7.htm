The use of poles and rings is consistent with other tabernacle furnishings, such as the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14</a>), emphasizing the need for portability. This design ensured that the altar could be transported without direct contact, maintaining its sanctity. The poles, often made of acacia wood and overlaid with bronze, symbolize strength and endurance, qualities necessary for the journey and service to God.<p><b>so that the poles are on two sides of the altar</b><br>The placement of the poles on two sides suggests a balanced and stable method of transport, ensuring the altar's integrity during movement. This design reflects God's attention to detail and order, which is a recurring theme in the construction of the tabernacle. The symmetry and balance can also be seen as a reflection of God's nature, emphasizing His perfection and the harmony He desires in worship.<p><b>when it is carried</b><br>The carrying of the altar signifies the Israelites' responsibility to maintain their worship practices wherever they traveled. This portability ensured that the sacrificial system, central to their covenant relationship with God, could continue uninterrupted. The act of carrying the altar also foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers being the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>), carrying God's presence with them. Additionally, it points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the weight of sin, paralleling the altar's role in atonement.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings, including the altar.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were to construct the Tabernacle according to the divine instructions given to Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>A sacred structure used for sacrifices, central to the worship practices of the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/poles_and_rings.htm">Poles and Rings</a></b><br>Components of the altar's design that facilitated its transportation, symbolizing the mobility of God's presence with His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_is_mobile.htm">God's Presence is Mobile</a></b><br>The design of the altar with poles and rings signifies that God's presence is not confined to a single location but moves with His people.
