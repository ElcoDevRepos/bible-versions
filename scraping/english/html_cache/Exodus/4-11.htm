In the context of Exodus, God is speaking to Moses at the burning bush, a pivotal moment in biblical history where God commissions Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. This direct dialogue emphasizes the personal relationship God has with His chosen leaders and His active role in guiding His people.<p><b>&#8220;Who gave man his mouth?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights God's sovereignty and creative power. In <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, God forms man and breathes life into him, establishing His role as the Creator. The mouth, as a symbol of communication and expression, is a gift from God, underscoring His authority over human abilities and limitations.<p><b>Or who makes the mute or the deaf,</b><br>Here, God asserts His control over human conditions, including disabilities. This can be seen as a reminder of God's omnipotence and His purpose in allowing certain conditions for His greater plan. In <a href="/john/9.htm">John 9:1-3</a>, Jesus explains that a man's blindness was so "the works of God might be displayed in him," suggesting that physical limitations can serve a divine purpose.<p><b>the sighted or the blind?</b><br>This phrase continues the theme of God's sovereignty over human faculties. The ability to see or the condition of blindness is within God's control. In the New Testament, Jesus heals the blind, demonstrating His divine authority and fulfilling prophecies about the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>).<p><b>Is it not I, the LORD?&#8221;</b><br>This concluding question reaffirms God's identity as the ultimate authority. The use of "I, the LORD" is a declaration of His covenant name, Yahweh, which signifies His eternal presence and faithfulness. This statement is a reminder of God's unchanging nature and His power to equip those He calls, as seen throughout Scripture in the lives of figures like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5-9</a>) and Paul (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and sovereignty.

Nothing is too hard for the Lord. He gives all powers - sight, and hearing, and speech included - to whom he will. He would have been "with Moses' mouth," removing all hesitation or indistinctness, and have "taught him what to say" - supplied the thought and the language by which to express it - if Moses would have let him. But the reply in ver. 13 shut up the Divine bounty, prevented its outpour, and left Moses the ineffective speaker which he was content to be. The words, <span class="cmt_word">O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send</span>, are curt and ungracious; much curter in the original than in our version. They contain a grudging acquiescence. But for the deprecatory particle with which they commence - the same as in ver. 10, they would be almost rude. And we see the result in the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/4-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun -
