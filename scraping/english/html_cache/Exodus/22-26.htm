The law here addresses the practice of taking a cloak as a pledge or collateral for a loan. This reflects the agrarian and communal society where personal property was limited, and the cloak was a vital possession. The principle of taking collateral is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10-13</a>, which also emphasizes the importance of treating the poor with dignity and compassion. This practice underscores the biblical theme of justice and mercy, ensuring that the poor are not deprived of their basic needs.<p><b>return it to him by sunset</b><br>The requirement to return the cloak by sunset highlights the importance of compassion and care for one's neighbor. In the cultural and historical context, nighttime temperatures could drop significantly, making the cloak necessary for warmth. This commandment reflects God's concern for the vulnerable and His desire for His people to act with kindness and empathy. It also points to the broader biblical principle of loving one's neighbor as oneself, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> and reiterated by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>. The act of returning the cloak by sunset can be seen as a type of Christ's provision and care for humanity, ensuring that our needs are met and that we are not left exposed or vulnerable.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor.htm">Neighbor</a></b><br>Refers to a fellow Israelite or someone living within the community.

In that moment, God calls the lender to remember compassion first (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Lending is pictured as an act of stewardship, not ownership (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your neighbor&#8217;s cloak</b><p>A cloak in ancient Israel doubled as both outer garment and nighttime blanket (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-13.htm">Deuteronomy 24:13</a>).

It was a warm wrapper, and has sometimes been compared to a Scotch plaid. The poor Israelite did not much want it by day; but needed it as a blanket by night--a practice known to many modern tribes of Arabs. The present passage forbids the retention of this garment as a pledge during the night, and seems to imply a continuous practice of pledging the <span class= "ital">simlah </span>by day, and being allowed to Enjoy the use of it, nevertheless, as a nocturnal covering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou take at all thy neighbour's raiment to pledge</span>. Lending upon pledge, the business of our modern pawnbrokers, was not forbidden by the Jewish law; only certain articles of primary necessity were forbidden to be taken, as the handmill for grinding flour, or either of its mill-stones (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a>). Borrowing upon pledge was practised largely in the time of Nehemiah, and led to very ill results. See Nehemiah ch. 5. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down</span>. The reason is given in the next verse. As it could not have been worth while to take the pledge at all, if it was immediately to have been given back for good, we must suppose a practice of depositing the garment during the day, and being allowed to have it out at night. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/22-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you take your neighbor&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1462;&#1425;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#234;&#183;&#8216;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7453.htm">Strong's 7453: </a> </span><span class="str2">Friend, companion, fellow</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cloak</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;al&#183;ma&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8008.htm">Strong's 8008: </a> </span><span class="str2">A wrapper, mantle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as collateral,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2254.htm">Strong's 2254: </a> </span><span class="str2">To wind tightly, to bind, a pledge, to pervert, destroy, to writhe in pain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">return it</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1462;&#1445;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#183;&#7687;en&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to him</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">by</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sunset,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">OT Law: Exodus 22:26 If you take your neighbor's garment as (Exo.
