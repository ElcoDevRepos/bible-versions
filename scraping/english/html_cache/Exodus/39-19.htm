The rings were functional, serving as connectors, but also symbolized the eternal and unchanging nature of God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece</b><br>The breastpiece, also known as the breastplate of judgment, was a central part of the high priest's attire, signifying his role as mediator between God and the Israelites. The attachment of the rings to the corners ensured that the breastpiece was securely fastened, symbolizing the stability and reliability of God's justice and guidance. The breastpiece contained the Urim and Thummim, used for divine decision-making, highlighting the priest's role in seeking God's will.<p><b>on the inside edge next to the ephod</b><br>The ephod was a sacred garment worn by the high priest, intricately woven with gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn. The placement of the rings on the inside edge next to the ephod indicates the close relationship between the two garments, both essential for the high priest's function. This connection underscores the unity and coherence of the priestly garments, reflecting the comprehensive nature of God's provision for His people.
