Linen, a fabric made from flax, was chosen for its quality and symbolic purity. In the ancient Near East, linen was often associated with priestly garments, emphasizing the separation of the sacred from the profane. Linen's breathability and comfort were practical for the hot climate of the region, ensuring the priests could perform their duties without hindrance. This requirement underscores the broader biblical theme of being clothed in righteousness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, where garments of salvation and robes of righteousness are mentioned.<p><b>to cover their bare flesh</b><br>Covering the bare flesh of the priests was a matter of modesty and respect for the sanctity of the tabernacle. In the cultural context of the ancient Israelites, nakedness was often associated with shame and dishonor, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>, where Adam and Eve realized their nakedness after sinning. The requirement to cover the flesh also served as a reminder of the need for spiritual purity and the avoidance of anything that might defile the sacred space. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to "put on the Lord Jesus Christ" and not make provision for the flesh (<a href="/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>).<p><b>extending from waist to thigh</b><br>The specific instruction for the undergarments to extend from waist to thigh ensured that the priests were adequately covered during their service. This detail highlights the importance of complete modesty and the avoidance of any exposure that could be considered inappropriate or distracting in the context of worship. The coverage from waist to thigh also symbolizes the protection of one's strength and dignity, as the loins are often associated with strength in biblical literature (<a href="/job/40-16.htm">Job 40:16</a>). This requirement for the priests can be seen as a type of the spiritual armor described in <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>, where believers are instructed to gird their loins with truth, emphasizing readiness and integrity in spiritual service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the priestly garments from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>The first priests of Israel, for whom these garments were specifically made to serve in the tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, where the priests performed their duties.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God delivered the laws and commandments, including the instructions for the priestly garments, to Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were to be a holy nation and a kingdom of priests.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>The linen undergarments symbolize the need for purity and holiness in approaching God.

Linen, throughout Scripture, is linked with purity and service before God (<a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17&#8211;18</a>). By specifying linen:<p>&#8226; God highlights the need for purity when approaching Him, just as Aaron and his sons were to wash before ministering (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; The natural, breathable fabric helped priests serve without distraction or sweat, echoing the principle that worship should be free of worldly encumbrances (<a href="/luke/10-41.htm">Luke 10:41&#8211;42</a>).<p>&#8226; The use of simple linen contrasts with the more ornate outer garments (<a href="/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4&#8211;5</a>), reminding us that inward holiness matters more than outward splendor (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25&#8211;28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to cover their bare flesh</b><p>The purpose clause centers on modesty and reverence: &#8220;to cover their bare flesh&#8221;. Scripture often uses clothing imagery to show both literal and spiritual covering:<p>&#8226; After the fall, God Himself provided coverings for Adam and Eve (<a href="/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a>), foreshadowing His provision for sin and shame.<p>&#8226; The priests&#8217; covering underscores that even God&#8217;s chosen servants need His provision to stand in His presence (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; Modesty safeguards the worship setting from distraction and protects sacred space (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse that follows warns that failure to wear these undergarments would bring guilt and death (<a href="/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a>), stressing the seriousness of approaching God on His terms (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>extending from waist to thigh</b><p>The design reaches &#8220;from waist to thigh&#8221;, ensuring full coverage of the reproductive area&#8212;a clear boundary of modesty. Key implications:<p>&#8226; By setting the lower limit at the thigh, God defines an objective standard for the priests; holiness is not left to personal taste (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; The deliberate length prevented exposure while ascending the altar&#8217;s steps (<a href="/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>), reinforcing that no hint of impropriety is acceptable in worship (<a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The specification guards the covenant community&#8217;s witness, showing that God&#8217;s servants value purity in both body and spirit (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds believers today that every part of life&#8212;even clothing choices&#8212;belongs under Christ&#8217;s lordship (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a> gives a detailed, literal instruction that reveals broader truths: God supplies pure garments, demands modesty, and sets clear boundaries for holiness.
