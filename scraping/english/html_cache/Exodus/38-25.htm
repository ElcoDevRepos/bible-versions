Each man over the age of twenty was required to give a half-shekel as a ransom for his life, symbolizing atonement and unity within the community. This tax was a means of supporting the tabernacle, the central place of worship. The act of numbering the people and collecting silver underscores the importance of each individual's contribution to the collective worship and service to God.<p><b>totaled 100 talents and 1,775 shekels</b><br>The total amount of silver collected was significant, indicating the large number of Israelites who participated in the census. A talent was a substantial weight, approximately 75 pounds or 34 kilograms, and a shekel was about 0.4 ounces or 11 grams. The specific total of 100 talents and 1,775 shekels highlights the meticulous record-keeping and organization involved in the construction of the tabernacle. This amount of silver was used for making the bases for the sanctuary and the curtain, as described in <a href="/exodus/38-27.htm">Exodus 38:27-28</a>, symbolizing the foundation of God's dwelling place among His people.<p><b>according to the sanctuary shekel&#8212;</b><br>The sanctuary shekel was a standard unit of weight used in the tabernacle, ensuring consistency and fairness in the collection and use of resources. This standardization reflects the order and precision required in worship and service to God. The use of the sanctuary shekel also emphasizes the sacred nature of the contributions, as they were dedicated to the service of the tabernacle, which was the earthly representation of God's presence among the Israelites. This concept of a standard measure can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the standard of righteousness and the foundation of the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle, including the collection of materials.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The congregation who contributed silver for the construction of the Tabernacle as part of their offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary constructed by the Israelites as a place of worship and the dwelling place of God among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>The craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary_shekel.htm">The Sanctuary Shekel</a></b><br>A standard unit of weight used in the collection of silver, ensuring uniformity and fairness in contributions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' contribution of silver was an act of obedience to God's command.

The text reminds us that worship involves concrete, costly obedience.<p>&#8226; By highlighting silver first, Moses calls attention to God&#8217;s provision flowing through His people, just as later believers willingly shared their possessions for ministry (<a href="/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34-35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from those numbered among the congregation</b><p>&#8226; Every Israelite male twenty years and older was counted and gave a half-shekel &#8220;atonement money&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12-16</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The census stressed individual responsibility before God&#8212;no one could hide in the crowd.<p>&#8226; Unlike David&#8217;s later misguided census (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1-17</a>), this numbering was commanded, underscoring that obedience to God&#8217;s precise instructions brings blessing, not judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>totaled 100 talents and 1,775 shekels</b><p>&#8226; The figure reflects meticulous record-keeping, showing God cares about details (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/38-27.htm">Exodus 38:27-28</a> explains how the 100 talents of silver became the sockets for the sanctuary walls, while the extra 1,775 shekels furnished hooks and bands. What was given was fully used&#8212;nothing wasted.<p>&#8226; The volume is staggering: a talent weighed roughly 75 pounds, so 100 talents equaled about 3&#190; tons.

Together these truths encourage believers today to give obediently, trust God&#8217;s exacting care, and marvel that He weaves individual acts of faithfulness into a dwelling place for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">The silver . . . was an hundred talents.</span>--The silver talent contained 3,000 shekels, as all allow, and as appears from the present passage. If the "shekel of the sanctuary" weighed, as is generally supposed, about 220 grains troy, the value of the silver contributed would have been 40,000, or a little under. It was contributed by "them that were numbered of the congregation," each of whom paid a bekah, or half a shekel.
