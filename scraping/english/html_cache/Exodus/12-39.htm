The absence of leaven in the dough signifies purity and a break from the past life in Egypt, which was filled with idolatry and oppression. This unleavened bread, or matzah, becomes a symbol of the haste in which the Israelites left Egypt, as well as a reminder of their deliverance. The Feast of Unleavened Bread, which follows Passover, commemorates this event and is a time for the Israelites to reflect on their liberation and God's provision.<p><b>the people baked what they had brought out of Egypt into unleavened loaves</b><br>The act of baking unleavened loaves highlights the practical aspects of the Israelites' departure. They had to use what they had on hand, emphasizing their reliance on God for sustenance. This moment foreshadows the manna that God would later provide in the wilderness, further illustrating His provision. The unleavened loaves also serve as a tangible reminder of the Israelites' journey from slavery to freedom, a theme that resonates throughout the Bible.<p><b>For when they had been driven out of Egypt</b><br>The phrase "driven out" underscores the urgency and divine intervention in the Exodus. Pharaoh's decision to release the Israelites came after the final plague, the death of the firstborn, which broke his resistance. This expulsion was not just a physical departure but a spiritual liberation from bondage. It reflects God's power and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and sets the stage for the establishment of Israel as a nation.<p><b>they could not delay</b><br>The haste of the departure is significant, as it demonstrates the immediacy of God's deliverance. The Israelites had to leave quickly, without time to prepare, which underscores their dependence on God. This urgency is mirrored in the New Testament call to be ready for Christ's return, living in a state of spiritual preparedness and reliance on God's timing.<p><b>and had not prepared any provisions for themselves</b><br>The lack of provisions highlights the Israelites' faith journey. They left Egypt with only what they could carry, trusting in God's promise to lead them to a land flowing with milk and honey. This reliance on God for daily needs is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in the provision of manna and quail in the wilderness and echoed in Jesus' teaching to pray for "our daily bread." It serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the importance of trusting Him for sustenance and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, who were enslaved in Egypt and are now being led out by Moses under God's command.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and from which they are now being delivered.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/unleavened_bread.htm">Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>Bread made without yeast, symbolizing the haste of the Israelites' departure and later becoming a significant element in the Passover celebration.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/exodus.htm">Exodus</a></b><br>The event of the Israelites' departure from Egypt, marking a pivotal moment in their history as God's chosen people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_unleavened_bread.htm">Symbolism of Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>Unleavened bread represents purity and separation from sin.
