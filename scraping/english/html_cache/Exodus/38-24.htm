Gold, a precious metal, was often associated with divinity and purity. In the context of the tabernacle, gold symbolized the holiness and glory of God. The use of gold in the sanctuary's construction reflects the sacredness of the space where God would dwell among His people.<p><b>used for the work on the sanctuary</b><br>The sanctuary refers to the tabernacle, the portable dwelling place for God among the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness. The work on the sanctuary involved skilled craftsmanship, as God had given specific instructions for its construction. The use of gold in the sanctuary's design highlights the importance of the tabernacle as a place of worship and meeting with God. This foreshadows the ultimate sanctuary, Jesus Christ, who is the true dwelling place of God with humanity.<p><b>totaled 29 talents and 730 shekels</b><br>A talent was a large unit of weight, approximately 75 pounds or 34 kilograms, and a shekel was a smaller unit, about 0.4 ounces or 11 grams. The total amount of gold used indicates the significant resources dedicated to the tabernacle, emphasizing its importance. This substantial quantity of gold reflects the Israelites' willingness to give generously for the work of God, a principle echoed in the New Testament with the call for believers to give cheerfully and sacrificially.<p><b>according to the sanctuary shekel</b><br>The sanctuary shekel was a standard measure used in the tabernacle, ensuring consistency and fairness in offerings and transactions. This standardization underscores the order and precision God required in worship and service. The use of a specific measure for the sanctuary highlights the importance of integrity and honesty in dealings related to worship and offerings, principles that are timeless in their application to the life of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>The craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who contributed materials for the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where God dwelled among His people during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wave_offering.htm">The Wave Offering</a></b><br>A type of offering presented before the Lord, symbolizing the dedication of the materials for sacred use.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites followed God's specific instructions for the Tabernacle, demonstrating the importance of obedience in our walk with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_in_giving.htm">Generosity in Giving</a></b><br>The contributions for the Tabernacle were given willingly by the people, highlighting the value of generosity in supporting God's work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>The precise amount of gold collected shows God's provision and the sufficiency of His resources for His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sacred_dedication.htm">Sacred Dedication</a></b><br>The use of the wave offering signifies the dedication of resources for holy purposes, reminding us to dedicate our talents and resources to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_involvement.htm">Community Involvement</a></b><br>The construction of the Tabernacle was a communal effort, illustrating the power of unity and collaboration in achieving God's plans.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_38_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 38:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_38_24_Giving_s_importance.htm">How does Exodus 38:24 demonstrate the importance of giving to God's work?

In this case the gold employed in the Tabernacle would have been worth nearly 320,000. Some, however, reduce the estimate to 175,000 (Cook), and others to 132,000 (Thenius). In any case the amount was remarkable, and indicated at once the liberal spirit which animated the people and the general feeling that a lavish expenditure was required by the occasion. There is no difficulty in supposing that the Israelites possessed at the time gold to the (highest) value estimated, since they had carried with them out of Egypt, besides their ancestral wealth, a vast amount of gold and silver ornaments, freely given to them by the Egyptians (<a href="/exodus/3-22.htm" title="But every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that sojournes in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters; and you shall spoil the Egyptians.">Exodus 3:22</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/12-35.htm" title="And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:">Exodus 12:35-36</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The gold</span>. The value of the gold has been estimated by Canon Cook at &pound;175,075 13s. 0d. of our money; by Thenius at 877,300 Prussian thalers, or about &pound;131,595. It was certainly under &pound;200,000. De Wette and others have argued that the possession of so large a sum in gold at this time by the Hebrew nation is inconceivable. But most critics are of a different opinion. Gold was very abundant in Egypt at the period, being imported from Ethiopia, a rich gold-producing country (Herod. 3:23; Diod. Sic. 3:11), as well as taken in tribute from the nations of Asia. The wealth of Rhampsinitus (Rameses III.), a little later than the exodus, was enormous (Herod. 2:121; Rawlinson, <span class="accented">History of Egypt</span>, vol. 2. pp. 368, 378). According to the preceding narrative (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35, 36</a>) much of the wealth of Egypt had, at the moment of their quitting the country, passed from the Egyptians to the Hebrews. If they numbered two millions of souls, their gold ornaments are likely to have been worth very much more than &pound;200,000 of our money.
