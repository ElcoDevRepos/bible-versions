It follows a dialogue where Moses seeks assurance of God's presence with Israel. The continuity suggests a deep, personal relationship between God and Moses, highlighting Moses' unique role as a mediator for the Israelites. This ongoing communication is a testament to the intimate relationship God desires with His chosen leaders.<p><b>There is a place near Me</b><br>This suggests a specific location where God intends to reveal His presence to Moses. The idea of proximity to God is significant, as it implies a place of safety and divine revelation. In biblical terms, being "near" God often symbolizes favor and protection. This also foreshadows the New Testament concept of drawing near to God through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p><b>where you are to stand</b><br>Standing is a posture of readiness and respect. In biblical times, standing before someone, especially a figure of authority, was a sign of attentiveness and reverence. This instruction to stand indicates that Moses is to be prepared for a significant encounter with God, emphasizing the seriousness and sacredness of the moment.<p><b>upon a rock</b><br>The rock is a symbol of stability and strength throughout Scripture. In this context, it serves as a literal and figurative foundation for Moses as he prepares to witness God's glory. The rock can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is referred to as the spiritual rock in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>. This connection underscores the idea of Christ as the foundation of faith and the source of spiritual sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is speaking directly to Moses, offering guidance and assurance of His presence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

His words flow out of the gracious offer He has just made: &#8220;My presence will go with you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>). This continuing dialogue underscores how God initiates and sustains fellowship:<p>&#8226; The same pattern appeared when &#8220;the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus later assures His disciples, &#8220;I am with you always&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>), showing that divine companionship is a constant theme from Sinai to the Great Commission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;There is a place near Me&#8221;</b><p>God pinpoints an exact location &#8220;near Me.&#8221; Closeness to the Almighty is always by invitation, never by presumption:<p>&#8226; Only Moses is summoned to that nearness (<a href="/exodus/24-2.htm">Exodus 24:2</a>), yet the principle extends: &#8220;Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/73-28.htm">Psalm 73:28</a> celebrates, &#8220;But as for me, it is good to draw near to God,&#8221; confirming that proximity to the LORD is both privilege and protection (see also <a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>).<p>The phrase makes clear that intimacy with God is spatially real and spiritually vital.
