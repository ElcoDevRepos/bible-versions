Moses ascending Mount Sinai is a pivotal event where he acts as a mediator between God and the people. The mountain, traditionally identified as Jebel Musa in the Sinai Peninsula, is a place of divine encounter. This ascent signifies Moses' role as a prophet and leader, chosen to receive God's law. The act of going up the mountain is symbolic of approaching God, a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as in the Transfiguration of Jesus on a mountain (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>).<p><b>the cloud covered it</b><br>The cloud is a recurring symbol of God's presence and glory, known as the Shekinah. In Exodus, the cloud represents God's guidance and protection, as seen when it led the Israelites through the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). The covering of the mountain by the cloud signifies God's holiness and the mystery of His presence, which is both awe-inspiring and inaccessible to the people. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where clouds often accompany divine revelation, such as during the Ascension of Jesus (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a>). The cloud also serves as a barrier, emphasizing the separation between the divine and the human, a theme that is reconciled through Christ, who bridges this gap.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the mediator between God and His people.
