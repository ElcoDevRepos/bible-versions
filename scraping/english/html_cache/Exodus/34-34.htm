In the context of the Old Testament, Moses is a central figure who acts as a mediator between God and the Israelites. This direct communication is significant because it underscores Moses' role as a prophet and leader. The phrase "before the LORD" indicates the presence of God, often associated with the Tabernacle, where God's presence dwelt among His people. This setting is crucial as it represents the holy and sacred space where divine instructions were given. The act of speaking with God foreshadows the intimate relationship believers are invited to have with God through prayer and the Holy Spirit.<p><b>he would remove the veil until he came out</b><br>The removal of the veil signifies the transparency and openness in Moses' communication with God. The veil, which Moses wore after speaking with God, served to shield the Israelites from the radiance of God's glory reflected on his face. This act of removing the veil symbolizes the unmediated access Moses had to God, contrasting with the Israelites' experience. In the New Testament, this veil is referenced in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-13.htm">2 Corinthians 3:13-16</a>, where Paul explains that the veil is lifted in Christ, allowing believers to behold God's glory directly. The veil also serves as a type of the separation between God and humanity, which is ultimately removed through Jesus Christ.<p><b>And when he came out, he would tell the Israelites what he had been commanded</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Moses' role as a conduit of God's commandments to the people. The act of coming out and speaking to the Israelites signifies the transmission of divine revelation. Moses' authority as a leader is reinforced by his role in conveying God's laws and instructions, which were foundational for the covenant community. This process of receiving and delivering God's word is a precursor to the prophetic tradition in Israel, where prophets would speak on behalf of God. The content of what Moses communicated often included laws, instructions, and guidance for living in accordance with God's will, which is central to the narrative of the Torah. This also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is the Word made flesh, bringing God's message of salvation to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the mediator between God and His people.
