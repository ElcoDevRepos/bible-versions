In ancient Israelite society, virginity was highly valued, and the loss of it outside of marriage could have significant social and familial implications. The term "seduces" implies persuasion or enticement, suggesting a consensual act rather than force or coercion.<p><b>who is not pledged in marriage</b><br>The distinction here is crucial, as it refers to a woman who is not betrothed or engaged. In biblical times, betrothal was a formal and binding agreement, akin to marriage, and breaking it had serious consequences. This law specifically addresses cases where the woman is free from such commitments, highlighting the importance of marital status in legal and social contexts.<p><b>and sleeps with her</b><br>This phrase indicates the act of sexual intercourse. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, such an act outside of marriage was considered a serious offense, impacting the woman's future prospects and her family's honor. The act necessitated a legal and social response to address the consequences.<p><b>he must pay the full dowry for her</b><br>The dowry, or bride price, was a customary payment made by the groom to the bride's family, serving as compensation and a form of security for the bride. This requirement underscores the seriousness of the act and the responsibility of the man to provide for the woman he has wronged. It reflects the value placed on the woman's future and the need to restore her social standing.<p><b>to be his wife</b><br>The culmination of the law is the requirement for the man to marry the woman, provided her father consents (as clarified in other biblical passages). This marriage serves as a form of restitution, ensuring the woman's protection and provision. It also reflects the biblical principle of accountability and the restoration of relationships. This law can be seen as a protective measure for the woman, ensuring her security and status within the community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/man.htm">Man</a></b><br>The individual who entices the virgin.

If the seducer were a person to whom he felt it a degradation to marry his daughter, he might exact from him such a sum as would be likely to induce another to wed her; if he was one whom he could accept as a son-in-law, he might compel him to re-establish his daughter's status by marriage.
