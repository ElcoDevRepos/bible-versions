Their assembly signifies the importance of communal leadership and decision-making.

The act of assembling the elders also reflects the organizational structure that Moses would later formalize with the establishment of judges and leaders (<a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>).

(<a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses &#8220;then&#8221; to mark a faith-filled response to divine command&#8212;think of Abraham leaving Ur immediately after God spoke (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moses and Aaron</b><p>&#8226;

&#8220;Went&#8221; reflects action, not mere intention&#8212;faith expressed through movement (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience precedes results; the plagues and exodus begin only after this step of going (<a href="/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And assembled</b><p>&#8226;

The action fulfills God&#8217;s directive to meet with the elders first, not Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Corporate hearing of God&#8217;s word strengthens communal faith;

No particulars of the journey are narrated, nor can we even tell what was the route which they followed. On their arrival, they at once set themselves to carry out the charge committed to them (<a href="/exodus/3-16.htm" title="Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:">Exodus 3:16</a>). The Israelites in Egypt, though suffering under severe oppression, had an organisation of their own, jurisdiction attaching probably to the heads of tribes, or of chief families. (Comp. <a href="/context/numbers/1-4.htm" title="And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers.">Numbers 1:4-16</a>.)

Moses and Aaron could have no power to convoke them; but they invited them to a conference, and the elders came.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-31.</span> - Moses seems to have parted with Zipporah and his children in Horeb, and to have sent them back to Jethro (<a href="/exodus/18-2.htm">Exodus 18:2</a>), perhaps because they might have interfered with the work which he had to do, perhaps because he thought Egypt would be no pleasant residence for them during the coming struggle. He journeyed onward from Horeb with Aaron for his sole companion, and had abundant time for taking counsel with him, and exercising the influence over him which high intellect and education combined will always give to their possessor. The journey from Horeb to Goshen occupied probably some weeks. On arriving in Goshen, the two brothers, in obedience to the divine command (<a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>), proceeded at once to "gather together all the elders of Israel" - that is, all these who exercised local authority over their countrymen in the various districts which they inhabited. Through the mouth of Aaron, Moses declared all that had been revealed to him at the burning bush and subsequently, exhibiting at the same time the credentials which proved him an ambassador from God, <span class="accented">i.e</span>. the three miracles which he had been empowered to work at any moment (<a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2-8</a>). The elders, being themselves convinced, summoned an assembly of the people, as is implied though not expressed in ver. 30; and the people, having heard the words of Aaron and seen the signs, were also convinced, and bowing their heads, worshipped the God whose ambassadors had appeared before them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the elders of Israel</span>, see note upon <a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>. It is clear that the Israelitish nation, though in bondage to the Egyptians, had a certain internal organisation of its own, and possessed a set of native officers. These were probably the hereditary heads of families. Moses and Aaron could have no authority to gather these persons together; but they issued an invitation, and it was accepted. The "elders" came to the meeting. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/4-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Aaron</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1425;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_175.htm">Strong's 175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aaron -- an elder brother of Moses</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and assembled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1488;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8217;as&#183;p&#772;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_622.htm">Strong's 622: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gather for, any purpose, to receive, take away, remove</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the elders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ziq&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2205.htm">Strong's 2205: </a> </span><span class="str2">Old</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the Israelites,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/4-29.htm">OT Law: Exodus 4:29 Moses and Aaron went and gathered together (Exo.
