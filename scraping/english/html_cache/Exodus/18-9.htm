His reaction underscores the universal acknowledgment of God's power, even among those outside the Israelite community. This joy reflects a common biblical theme where God's deliverance leads to rejoicing, as seen in Psalms and the New Testament.<p><b>over all the good things the LORD had done for Israel</b><br>The "good things" refer to the miraculous events and provisions during the Exodus, such as the plagues, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of manna. This phrase emphasizes God's faithfulness and covenantal love for Israel, fulfilling promises made to the patriarchs. It also foreshadows the ultimate good in the New Testament, where Jesus' sacrifice brings salvation.<p><b>whom He had rescued from the hand of the Egyptians</b><br>This phrase recalls the central act of deliverance in the Old Testament, the Exodus, which is a foundational event for Israel's identity. It signifies God's power over oppressive forces and His role as a redeemer. This deliverance is a type of Christ's work, where Jesus rescues humanity from sin and death, paralleling the liberation from Egypt.
