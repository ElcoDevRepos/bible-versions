In the ancient Near Eastern context, family was the foundational unit of society, and honoring one's parents was a fundamental commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). The act of striking a parent was not merely a personal offense but a disruption of the social order and a direct challenge to the authority established by God. This commandment underscores the importance of respecting parental authority, which is echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/6.htm">Ephesians 6:1-3</a>).<p><b>must surely be put to death.</b><br>The prescribed punishment of death reflects the seriousness with which this offense was regarded. In the context of the Mosaic Law, certain actions that threatened the community's stability and holiness were met with capital punishment. This severe penalty served as a deterrent and underscored the sanctity of the family unit. The law aimed to maintain order and reflect God's holiness among His people (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). While the New Testament does not prescribe such penalties, the principle of honoring one's parents remains, highlighting the continuity of moral law across both covenants. This also points to the ultimate justice of God, who will judge all actions, and foreshadows the need for a Savior who fulfills the law perfectly (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the Law from God on Mount Sinai, including the laws found in <a href="/bsb/exodus/21.htm">Exodus 21</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given the Law to guide their conduct and relationship with God and each other.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God delivered the Law to Moses, including the commandments and ordinances for the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/parents.htm">Parents (Father and Mother)</a></b><br>Central figures in the family unit, representing authority and the foundation of societal structure in ancient Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_giving_of_the_law.htm">The Giving of the Law</a></b><br>A significant event where God provided the Israelites with commandments and laws to establish a covenant relationship and societal order.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_family_authority.htm">The Sanctity of Family Authority</a></b><br>The commandment underscores the importance of respecting and upholding the authority of parents, which is foundational to a stable and godly society.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_disobedience.htm">The Seriousness of Disobedience</a></b><br>The severe penalty for striking a parent reflects the gravity of such an act and serves as a deterrent against undermining family and societal order.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_as_a_reflection_of_godliness.htm">Respect as a Reflection of Godliness</a></b><br>Honoring parents is not only a social obligation but a spiritual one, reflecting our reverence for God's established order.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_law_in_moral_guidance.htm">The Role of the Law in Moral Guidance</a></b><br>The laws given to the Israelites were meant to guide them in righteous living and to reflect God's holiness in their community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/application_in_modern_context.htm">Application in Modern Context</a></b><br>While the specific penalties may not apply today, the principle of honoring and respecting parental authority remains relevant and essential for Christian living.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_21_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 21:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_15_Honor_parents_value_today.htm">How does Exodus 21:15 emphasize the importance of honoring one's parents today?

Though the church today is not a theocratic nation administering capital punishment, the passage still proclaims God&#8217;s unchanging view of parental honor and the grave sin of violence against those He has placed over us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15-17) <span class= "bld">And he that smiteth his father . . .</span>-With homicide are conjoined some other offences, regarded as of a heinous character, and made punishable by death: viz. (1), striking a parent; (2) kidnapping; and (3) cursing a parent. The immediate sequence of these crimes upon murder, and their punishment by the same penalty, marks strongly God's abhorrence of them. The parent is viewed as God's representative, and to smite him is to offer God an insult in his person. To curse him implies, if possible, a greater want of reverence; and, since curses can only be effectual as appeals to God, it is an attempt to enlist God on our side against His representative. Kidnapping is a crime against the person only a very little short of murder, since it is to deprive a man of that which gives life its chief value--liberty. Many a man would prefer death to slavery; and to almost all the passing into the slave condition would be a calamity of the most terrible kind, Involving life-long misery. Its suddenness and unexpectedness, when the result of kidnapping, would augment its grievousness, and render it the most crushing of all misfortunes. Joseph's history shows us how easy it was to sell a free man as a slave, and obtain his immediate removal into a distant country (<a href="/context/genesis/37-25.htm" title="And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.">Genesis 37:25-28</a>). The Egyptian annals tell us of bloody wars carried on for kidnapping purposes (Lenormant, <span class= "ital">Histoire Ancienne, </span>vol. i., pp. 423, 424). In the classical times and countries, the slaves offered for sale in the markets had usually been obtained in this way. The stringent law of the Mosaic code (<a href="/exodus/21-16.htm" title="And he that steals a man, and sells him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.">Exodus 21:16</a>) was greatly needed to check an atrocious crime very widely committed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - <span class="accented">Other capital offences</span>. The unsystematic character of the arrangement in this chapter is remarkably shown by this interruption of the consideration of different sorts of homicide, in order to introduce offences of quite a different character, and those not very closely allied to each other - <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Striking a parent; <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Kidnapping; <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Cursing a parent<span class="cmt_word">.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that smiteth his father</span>, etc. To "smite" here is simply to "strike" - to offer the indignity of a blow - not to kill, which had already been made capital (ver. 12), not in the case of parents only, but in every case. The severity of the law is very remarkable, and strongly emphasises the dignity and authority of parents. There is no parallel to it in any other known code, though of course the <span class="accented">patria potestas</span> of the Roman father gave him the power of punishing a son who had struck him, capitally. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/21-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He who strikes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mak&#183;k&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5221.htm">Strong's 5221: </a> </span><span class="str2">To strike</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his father</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1.htm">Strong's 1: </a> </span><span class="str2">Father</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or mother</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_517.htm">Strong's 517: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mother, )</span><br /><br /><span class="word">must surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><br /><span class="word">be put to death.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1469;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#363;&#183;m&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hofal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/21-15.htm">OT Law: Exodus 21:15 Anyone who attacks his father or his (Exo.
