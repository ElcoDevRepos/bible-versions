They had just come from a meeting with Pharaoh, where they pleaded for relief from the harsh labor conditions imposed on them. This context highlights the increasing oppression of the Israelites in Egypt, a fulfillment of God's earlier revelation to Abraham that his descendants would be enslaved and mistreated (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>). The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a recurring theme, demonstrating the spiritual battle between God's will and human resistance.<p><b>they confronted Moses and Aaron</b><br>The confrontation indicates a moment of tension and blame. Moses and Aaron, as leaders chosen by God, were expected to deliver the Israelites from bondage. However, the immediate result of their intervention was increased suffering, leading to frustration and anger from the people. This reflects a common biblical theme where God's deliverance often involves a period of testing and increased difficulty before the ultimate redemption. It also foreshadows the Israelites' repeated complaints and lack of faith during their wilderness journey.<p><b>who stood waiting to meet them</b><br>Moses and Aaron's position of waiting suggests their anticipation of the foremen's report. It underscores their role as mediators between God and the people. This scene can be seen as a type of Christ, who stands as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The waiting also signifies their readiness to fulfill God's command, despite the challenges and opposition they face. This moment is pivotal in the narrative, as it sets the stage for God's subsequent actions to demonstrate His power and faithfulness through the plagues and eventual deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Exodus account, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.

Their &#8220;leaving&#8221; is saturated with disappointment and fear, much like the disciples leaving the empty tomb in <a href="/john/20-10.htm">John 20:10</a> before they grasped the good news.<p>&#8226; This moment reveals how worldly authority often resists God&#8217;s purposes (<a href="/acts/4-18.htm">Acts 4:18&#8211;21</a>). Pharaoh embodies opposition to divine redemption, foreshadowing every ruler who &#8220;sets himself against the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The foremen&#8217;s exit marks a transition from human hope in political favor to an inevitable dependence on God alone (<a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they confronted Moses and Aaron</b><p>&#8220; &#8230;they met Moses and Aaron standing to meet them. &#8221;<p>&#8226; Confrontation surfaces when expectations clash with God&#8217;s timing. The foremen expected immediate relief, yet the situation worsened. Similar frustration erupts in <a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a> when Israel complains to Moses after the spies&#8217; report.<p>&#8226; Moses and Aaron, though divinely appointed (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>; 4:14), become lightning rods for Israel&#8217;s anger. Spiritual leaders often absorb blame that rightly belongs to the real oppressor (<a href="/1_samuel/8-6.htm">1 Samuel 8:6&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Their willingness to face the foremen head-on models shepherding courage. Rather than retreat, they stand available&#8212;reflecting Jesus, who &#8220;went out to meet&#8221; those coming to arrest Him (<a href="/john/18-4.htm">John 18:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who stood waiting to meet them</b><p>&#8226; The phrase shows intentional presence. Moses and Aaron anticipate the fallout and position themselves to listen, much like Job&#8217;s friends who &#8220;sat with him on the ground&#8221; (<a href="/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>) before speaking.<p>&#8226; Waiting is an act of faith. They are confident in God&#8217;s promise from <a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a> that He will &#8220;stretch out My hand and strike Egypt.&#8221; Their waiting mirrors <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>: &#8220;Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By meeting the foremen outside Pharaoh&#8217;s court, they signal that leadership identifies with the people, not with oppressive power&#8212;paralleling <a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12&#8211;13</a> where Christ suffers &#8220;outside the camp&#8221; to sanctify His own.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20</a> captures a tense hinge in the redemption story: the oppressed leave a hostile ruler, confront God&#8217;s servants, and find those servants already present, waiting. The verse highlights the clash between earthly authority and divine mission, the burden spiritual leaders bear, and the necessity of steadfast presence amid disappointment. It invites confidence that, even when circumstances worsen, God&#8217;s appointed deliverance is still on schedule and His leaders stand ready to walk with His people until that promise is fulfilled.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Who stood in the way.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">in</span> <span class= "ital">their way.</span> The meaning is, that Moses and Aaron were "standing"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> waiting to meet them, and know the result of their interview with the monarch.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - On quitting the presence of Pharaoh, the officers of the Israelites, burning with the sense of the injustice done them, and deeply apprehensive with respect to their own future, found Moses and Aaron waiting in the precincts of the court to know the result of their application. It need cause no surprise that they poured out their pent-up indignation upon them. Were not Moses and Aaron the sole cause of the existing state of things? Did not the extreme affliction of the people, did not their own sufferings in the past, did not their apprehended sufferings in the future, originate wholly in the seductive words which the two brothers had addressed to them at the assembly of the people? (<a href="/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29-31</a>). Accordingly, they denounced, almost cursed their officious would-be deliverers (<a href="/exodus/5-21.htm">Exodus 5:21</a>). "The Lord look upon you, and judge" between you and us, whether the blame of this whole matter does not lie upon you, its initiators - you have made us to be abhorred in the sight of Pharaoh, and of the Egyptians generally you have brought us into danger of our lives - the Lord judge you!" <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who stood in the way</span>. Rather, "who waited to meet them." It was not accident, but design, that had brought the two brothers to the spot. They were as anxious as the officers to know what course Pharaoh would take - whether he would relax the burthens of the people or no - whether he would have compassion or the contrary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/5-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When they left</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;&#1514;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Pharaoh,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they confronted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yip&#772;&#183;g&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6293.htm">Strong's 6293: </a> </span><span class="str2">To impinge, by accident, violence, by importunity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Aaron,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_175.htm">Strong's 175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aaron -- an elder brother of Moses</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who stood</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5324.htm">Strong's 5324: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take one's stand, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">waiting to meet them.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(liq&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7125.htm">Strong's 7125: </a> </span><span class="str2">Against he come, help, meet, seek, to, in the way </span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/5-20.htm">OT Law: Exodus 5:20 They met Moses and Aaron who stood (Exo.
