The skilled craftsmen were individuals endowed with specific talents necessary for the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings. In the ancient Near Eastern context, craftsmanship was a highly valued skill, often passed down through generations. The instruction to involve skilled craftsmen underscores the importance of precision and excellence in creating items for worship. This reflects the broader biblical principle that God values and uses human skill and creativity for His purposes, as seen in the building of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>).<p><b>whom I have filled with a spirit of wisdom</b><br>The "spirit of wisdom" here refers to a divine endowment of skill and understanding necessary for the task at hand. This is not merely human wisdom but a special empowerment from God, similar to the wisdom given to Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>). This divine filling is reminiscent of the New Testament concept of spiritual gifts, where believers are equipped by the Holy Spirit for service (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>). It highlights the idea that God equips those He calls, ensuring they have the necessary abilities to fulfill His commands.<p><b>to make garments for Aaron&#8217;s consecration</b><br>The garments were not ordinary clothing but were specifically designed for Aaron's consecration as high priest. The consecration process involved setting Aaron apart for sacred service, and the garments played a crucial role in this. Each piece of the priestly attire had symbolic significance, representing aspects of holiness, service, and the relationship between God and His people. The detailed description of these garments in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a> emphasizes their importance in the worship and sacrificial system of Israel.<p><b>so that he may serve Me as priest</b><br>This phrase highlights the purpose of the garments: to enable Aaron to serve as a priest. The role of the priest was to mediate between God and the people, offering sacrifices and prayers on their behalf. This mediatorial role is a type of Jesus Christ, who is described as our High Priest in the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). Just as Aaron needed to be consecrated and properly attired to serve, so Jesus, through His perfect life and sacrificial death, is uniquely qualified to intercede for humanity. The priesthood of Aaron foreshadows the ultimate priesthood of Christ, who serves eternally in the heavenly sanctuary.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

The Hebrews regarded the heart as the seat of knowledge, with perhaps neither more nor less scientific accuracy than underlies our own current modes of speech whereby the heart is made the seat of the affections.<p><span class= "bld">Whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom.</span>--Few passages in the Bible are more antagonistic than this to the general current of modern thought. God speaks of Himself as having infused His Spirit into the hearts of men, in order to enable them to produce satisfactory priestly garments. Moderns suppose such things to be quite beneath the notice of the Creator of the universe. But it has to be remembered, on the other hand, (1) that God is the fountain whence all knowledge is derived; (2) that He alone knows what is beneath Him and what is not beneath Him; and (3) that dress is not a wholly insignificant matter, or so much would not have been said in Scripture about it (<a href="/genesis/3-21.htm" title="To Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.">Genesis 3:21</a>; <a href="/genesis/37-3.htm" title="Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.">Genesis 37:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm" title="And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in clothing of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/8-7.htm" title="And he put on him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it to him therewith.">Leviticus 8:7-9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-4.htm" title="He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches on his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen turban shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.">Leviticus 16:4</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-38.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue:">Numbers 15:38</a>, &c.). Garments intended "for glory and for beauty" (<a href="/exodus/28-2.htm" title="And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother for glory and for beauty.">Exodus 28:2</a>) required artistic power in those who were to make them; and artistic power, like all other intellectual excellence, is the gift of God. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wise-hearted</span>. In modern parlance the heart is made the seat of the affections and emotions, the brain of the intellect. But the Hebrew idiom was different. There the heart was constantly spoken of as the seat of wisdom. (See below, <a href="/exodus/31-6.htm">Exodus 31:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/35-10.htm">Exodus 35:10, 25</a>; <a href="/exodus/36-1.htm">Exodus 36:1, 2</a>; <a href="/job/9-4.htm">Job 9:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-29.htm">Proverbs 11:29</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">The spirit of wisdom</span> might seem to be scarcely necessary for the work of constructing a set of priestly garments; but where "glory and beauty" are required, high artistic power is needed; and this power is regarded by the sacred writers, as indeed it is by most of those who have written on the human understanding - notably Plato and Aristotle - as a very important part of the intellect. <span class="accented">Techne</span>, says Aristotle, involves <span class="accented">theoria</span>, as well as <span class="accented">aesthesis</span> and <span class="accented">genesis</span>, requires, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a knowledge of high abstract truths, as well as the perceptive faculty which we commonly call "taste," and the constructive one known as "power of execution."
