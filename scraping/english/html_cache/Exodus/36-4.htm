In the context of Exodus, these craftsmen were divinely inspired and equipped by God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a>, where Bezalel and Oholiab are mentioned as leaders filled with the Spirit of God for this purpose. This highlights the importance of God-given skills and talents in fulfilling His purposes.<p><b>who were doing all the work</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the active involvement and dedication of the craftsmen in the construction of the sanctuary. This work was not just manual labor but a sacred task, as the sanctuary was to be the dwelling place of God among His people. The meticulous nature of their work reflects the detailed instructions given by God in previous chapters (Exodus 25-31), underscoring the importance of obedience and precision in worship.<p><b>on the sanctuary</b><br>The sanctuary, also known as the Tabernacle, was a portable earthly dwelling place for God among the Israelites. It served as a central place of worship and sacrifice during their journey through the wilderness. The construction of the sanctuary was a fulfillment of God's command in <a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>, "Then have them make a sanctuary for Me, so that I may dwell among them." This foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who is described in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> as the Word who "became flesh and made His dwelling among us."<p><b>left their work</b><br>This indicates a pause or interruption in the construction process. The context in <a href="/exodus/36.htm">Exodus 36</a> reveals that the craftsmen stopped because the people had brought more than enough materials for the work (<a href="/exodus/36-5.htm">Exodus 36:5-7</a>). This abundance reflects the generosity and willingness of the Israelites to contribute to God's work, a principle echoed in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, where believers are encouraged to give cheerfully.
