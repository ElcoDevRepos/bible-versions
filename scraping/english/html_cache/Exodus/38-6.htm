This choice of material reflects the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel. Acacia trees were abundant in the Sinai region, making them a practical choice for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The use of acacia wood also symbolizes the incorruptible humanity of Christ, who is often typified by the Tabernacle and its elements.<p><b>and overlaid them with bronze</b><br>Bronze, a metal alloy of copper and tin, was used extensively in the Tabernacle for items associated with judgment and sacrifice, such as the altar and its utensils. The overlaying of acacia wood with bronze signifies the strength and resilience required for the poles, which were used to carry the altar. Bronze's association with judgment can be seen in its use in the construction of the bronze serpent (<a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>), which prefigures Christ's crucifixion (<a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>). The combination of wood and bronze in the poles highlights the dual nature of Christ as both human (wood) and divine (bronze), who bears the judgment of sin on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.
