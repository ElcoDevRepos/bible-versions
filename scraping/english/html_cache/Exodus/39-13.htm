Each stone represents one of the twelve tribes of Israel, signifying the high priest's role in bearing the tribes before God. Beryl is often associated with the tribe of Dan and is noted for its sea-green color, symbolizing judgment and discernment. Onyx, linked to the tribe of Joseph, is a stone of strength and stability, often used in ancient times for seals and signets. Jasper, associated with the tribe of Benjamin, is a stone of beauty and endurance, often described in Revelation as part of the New Jerusalem's foundation, symbolizing eternal beauty and God's glory. The arrangement of these stones reflects the order and precision of God's design for His people.<p><b>These stones were mounted in gold filigree settings.</b><br>The use of gold filigree settings for mounting the stones highlights the value and sacredness of the high priest's garments. Gold, a symbol of purity and divinity, underscores the holiness required of the high priest as he ministers before God. The intricate craftsmanship of filigree work reflects the skill and dedication required in serving God, paralleling the detailed instructions given for the tabernacle's construction. This craftsmanship also points to the beauty and order of God's creation, as well as the care He takes in preparing His people for service. The gold settings ensure that the stones are securely held, symbolizing the secure and eternal nature of God's covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given the task of constructing the Tabernacle and its furnishings according to God's specific instructions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled artisans appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its sacred garments, including the priestly breastplate.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priestly_breastplate.htm">The Priestly Breastplate</a></b><br>A sacred garment worn by the High Priest, containing twelve stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stones.htm">The Stones (Beryl, Onyx, Jasper)</a></b><br>Precious stones set in the breastplate, each symbolizing one of the tribes of Israel, reflecting God's covenant and the unity of His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_stones.htm">Symbolism of the Stones</a></b><br>Each stone in the breastplate represents a tribe of Israel, emphasizing the importance of unity and diversity within the body of Christ.
