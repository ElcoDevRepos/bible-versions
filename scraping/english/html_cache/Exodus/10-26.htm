The livestock represents not only economic resources but also a means of worship. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, livestock were integral to both daily life and religious practices. The insistence on taking all livestock underscores the totality of the Israelites' departure and their commitment to worship God fully.<p><b>not a hoof will be left behind,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the completeness of the Israelites' departure from Egypt. It signifies a total break from their past life of bondage. The meticulous detail of "not a hoof" indicates the thoroughness of God's deliverance. It also reflects the Israelites' determination to obey God's command without compromise, a theme echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, where obedience is prioritized over sacrifice.<p><b>for we will need some of them to worship the LORD our God,</b><br>The livestock were necessary for sacrificial offerings, which were central to Israelite worship. This highlights the importance of sacrifice in maintaining a covenant relationship with God, as seen in Leviticus. The phrase also points to the future establishment of the sacrificial system under the Mosaic Law, which foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, as described in <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>.<p><b>and we will not know how we are to worship the LORD until we arrive.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects the Israelites' dependence on divine guidance. It underscores the theme of faith and trust in God's provision and direction, a recurring motif throughout the wilderness journey. The uncertainty of how they will worship until they reach their destination parallels the Christian walk of faith, where believers are called to trust in God's plan without knowing all the details, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egyptian bondage.

His immediate response underscores that every resource Israel possesses belongs to God and must be available for His purposes (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>).<p>- God had earlier told Moses to request a three-day journey &#8220;so that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/5-3.htm">Exodus 5:3</a>). The livestock, therefore, are not optional extras; they are integral to that act of sacrifice.<p>- This moment anticipates the later requirement that no Israelite was to appear before the LORD empty-handed (<a href="/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not a hoof will be left behind</b><p>- The phrase conveys total commitment. Partial obedience is disobedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>; <a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>).<p>- &#8220;Not a hoof&#8221; also implies that Pharaoh will not retain any leverage over Israel. Leaving animals behind would tether them to Egypt. God&#8217;s deliverance is complete and unconditional (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<p>- The meticulous wording hints at God&#8217;s sovereign protection: even the tiniest part of the covenant people&#8217;s property will be brought out safely (<a href="/exodus/12-32.htm">Exodus 12:32, 38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for we will need some of them to worship the LORD our God</b><p>- Sacrificial worship in the Mosaic era required animals&#8212;burnt offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1&#8211;4</a>). Moses anticipates these commands even before Sinai.<p>- True worship costs something valuable (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15-16</a>). By dedicating their best animals, Israel acknowledges God&#8217;s ownership and grace (<a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a>).<p>- The statement also rebukes Pharaoh&#8217;s worldview: livestock are not merely economic assets but instruments for honoring the living God (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we will not know how we are to worship the LORD until we arrive</b><p>- Moses confesses dependence on future revelation. Israel must be ready to obey whatever specific instructions God gives at the appointed place (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>; 19:3-6).<p>- This humility models faith-filled obedience: walk forward, then receive fuller light (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8-10</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>).<p>- It reminds us that worship is defined by God, not personal preference. The pattern will be unfolded at Sinai, where detailed regulations for sacrifice and tabernacle service are given (<a href="/bsb/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25&#8211;31</a>; <a href="/bsb/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Moses&#8217; insistence that every animal accompany Israel declares absolute devotion to God, total separation from Egypt, and readiness to obey yet-to-be-revealed commands. The verse teaches that nothing we possess is exempt from God&#8217;s claim, partial obedience is unacceptable, and true worship requires both sacrifice and submission to God&#8217;s unfolding word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Our cattle also shall go with us.</span>--Once more Moses rejects the proffered compromise--rejects it absolutely and altogether.
