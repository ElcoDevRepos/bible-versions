A Hebrew servant was typically a fellow Israelite who sold themselves into servitude to pay off debts or to provide for their family. This practice is distinct from slavery as understood in other historical contexts, as it was regulated by the Law of Moses to ensure humane treatment. The term "buy" here indicates a contractual agreement rather than ownership of a person, reflecting the economic and social structures of the time.<p><b>he is to serve you for six years.</b><br>The six-year period of service reflects a structured and limited term, emphasizing the temporary nature of this servitude. This regulation ensured that servitude did not become a permanent state, protecting the dignity and rights of the servant. The number six often symbolizes human labor and effort in biblical numerology, as seen in the six days of creation and the six days of work before the Sabbath rest.<p><b>But in the seventh year,</b><br>The seventh year is significant in biblical theology, often associated with rest and release. This concept is rooted in the creation narrative, where God rested on the seventh day, and is further developed in the Sabbath laws and the Year of Jubilee. The seventh year served as a reminder of God's provision and the importance of rest and freedom.<p><b>he shall go free without paying anything.</b><br>The release of the servant without payment underscores the principle of grace and redemption. This provision ensured that the servant was not burdened with further debt upon release, reflecting God's desire for His people to live in freedom. This practice foreshadows the ultimate redemption found in Jesus Christ, who offers freedom from the bondage of sin without cost to the believer. The concept of freedom without payment is echoed in the New Testament, where salvation is described as a free gift of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrew_servant.htm">Hebrew Servant</a></b><br>A fellow Israelite who, due to poverty or debt, sells himself into servitude.

"The ultimate elements of the household," says Aristotle, "are the master and his slave, the husband and his wife, the father and his children" (<span class= "ital">Pol. i.</span> 2, ? 1). In any consideration of the rights of persons, those of the slave class naturally presented themselves first of all, since they were the most liable to infraction. Slaves might be either natives or foreigners. A Hebrew could become a slave--(1) through crime (<a href="/exodus/22-3.htm" title="If the sun be risen on him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.">Exodus 22:3</a>); (2) through indebtedness (<a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:">Leviticus 25:39</a>); (3) through his father's right to sell him (<a href="/nehemiah/5-5.htm" title="Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children: and, see, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.">Nehemiah 5:5</a>).

The rights of Hebrew slaves are here specially considered.<p><span class= "bld">Six years shall he serve.</span>--The Hebrew was not to be retained in slavery for a longer space than six years.

This law was an enormous advance upon anything previously known in the slave legislation of the most civilised country, and stamps the Mosaic code at once as sympathising with the slave, and bent on ameliorating his lot. It has been thought strange by some that slavery was not now abrogated; but even Christianity, fifteen hundred years later, did not venture on so complete a social revolution. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> ? <span class="cmt_word">If thou buy an Hebrew servant</span>. Slavery, it is clear, was an existing institution. The law of Moses did not make it, but found it, and by not forbidding, allowed it. The Divine legislator was content under the circumstances to introduce mitigations and alleviations into the slave condition. Hebrews commonly became slaves through poverty (<a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35, 39</a>), but sometimes through crime (<a href="/exodus/22-3.htm">Exodus 22:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the seventh he shall go out.</span> Not in the Sabbatical year, but at the commencement of the seventh year after he became a slave.

This was an enormous boon, and had nothing, so far as is known, correspondent to it in the legislation of any other country. Nor was this all. When he went out free, his late master was bound to furnish him with provisions out of his flock, and out of his threshing floor, and out of his winepress (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-14</a>), so that he might have something wherewith to begin the world afresh.
