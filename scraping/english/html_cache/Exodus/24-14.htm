The elders played a crucial role in the governance and spiritual guidance of the community. This reflects the structure of leadership established by God, where Moses, as the primary leader, delegates authority to others. The role of elders is seen throughout the Old Testament and into the New Testament, where elders are appointed in the early church (<a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>).<p><b>Wait here for us until we return to you</b><br>Moses instructs the elders to remain at a specific location while he ascends Mount Sinai to receive the tablets of the Law. This command implies a temporary absence and a promise of return, which can be seen as a test of faith and patience for the people. The concept of waiting is significant in Scripture, often associated with trusting in God's timing and purposes (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>).<p><b>Aaron and Hur are here with you</b><br>Aaron, Moses' brother, and Hur, a leader from the tribe of Judah, are left in charge during Moses' absence. This delegation of authority highlights the importance of shared leadership and accountability. Aaron later becomes the first high priest, and Hur is traditionally believed to be the grandfather of Bezalel, the chief artisan of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2</a>). Their presence signifies continuity of leadership and the maintenance of order among the people.<p><b>Whoever has a dispute can go to them</b><br>Moses establishes a system for resolving conflicts in his absence, ensuring that the community's needs are met. This reflects the judicial system set up earlier in <a href="/exodus/18.htm">Exodus 18</a>, where Moses, advised by Jethro, appoints capable men to judge minor disputes. This system foreshadows the role of judges and leaders in Israel's history and emphasizes the importance of justice and order. It also points to Christ as the ultimate judge and mediator, who resolves the greatest dispute between God and humanity through His sacrifice (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and to receive the Law on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders.htm">Elders</a></b><br>Leaders among the Israelites who were appointed to assist Moses in governing the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother, who served as his spokesperson and later became the first high priest of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hur.htm">Hur</a></b><br>A leader among the Israelites, possibly from the tribe of Judah, who assisted Aaron in leadership during Moses' absence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where Moses received the Ten Commandments and the Law from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/delegation_of_authority.htm">Delegation of Authority</a></b><br>Moses' instruction to the elders to rely on Aaron and Hur demonstrates the importance of delegating authority to trusted leaders.
