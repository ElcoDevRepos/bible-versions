It served as the dwelling place of God among His people. The construction of the tabernacle was a significant event, as it symbolized God's presence and His covenant with Israel. The tabernacle's design and function foreshadowed the coming of Jesus Christ, who would dwell among humanity as the ultimate tabernacle (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The tabernacle's structure, with its outer court, Holy Place, and Most Holy Place, reflects the separation between God and man due to sin, a separation ultimately bridged by Christ.<p><b>according to the pattern</b><br>The pattern for the tabernacle was divinely given, emphasizing that worship and approach to God must be on His terms, not human invention. This pattern included detailed instructions for the materials, dimensions, and furnishings, underscoring the importance of obedience and reverence in worship. The specificity of the pattern highlights God's holiness and the need for purity and order in His presence. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to worship in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<p><b>shown you on the mountain</b><br>The mountain refers to Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Law and the instructions for the tabernacle. This location is significant as it was a place of divine revelation and covenant-making. The mountain represents a meeting point between God and man, a theme that recurs throughout Scripture. The giving of the tabernacle's pattern on the mountain signifies that it was not a human creation but a divine ordinance. This mirrors the transfiguration of Jesus on a mountain (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-8</a>), where His divine nature was revealed, further connecting the tabernacle to Christ as the ultimate revelation of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to receive the Law on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable earthly dwelling place for the divine presence, designed by God and constructed by the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where Moses received the Ten Commandments and the detailed instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and journeyed through the wilderness to the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence.htm">God's Presence</a></b><br>The divine presence that would dwell among the Israelites in the Tabernacle, signifying God's covenant and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_blueprint.htm">Divine Blueprint</a></b><br>God's instructions are precise and purposeful.
