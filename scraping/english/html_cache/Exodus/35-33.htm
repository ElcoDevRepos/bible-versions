The cutting of gemstones was a highly specialized skill, reflecting the importance and sacredness of the Tabernacle. Gemstones were used in the High Priest's breastplate (<a href="/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17-20</a>), symbolizing the tribes of Israel and their connection to God. The precision needed for cutting gemstones signifies the care and reverence due to God's dwelling place. This craftsmanship can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18-21</a>, where precious stones are used to describe the city's foundations, emphasizing the beauty and holiness of God's eternal dwelling.<p><b>and to carve wood</b><br>Wood carving was another essential skill in the construction of the Tabernacle, as many of its components, such as the Ark of the Covenant, were made of acacia wood (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10</a>). This wood was chosen for its durability and resistance to decay, symbolizing the enduring nature of God's covenant with His people. The artistry involved in wood carving reflects the creativity endowed by God to His people, allowing them to contribute to His divine plan. This craftsmanship can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as a carpenter in <a href="/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a>, symbolizing His role in building the spiritual house of God, the Church.<p><b>so that he may be a master of every artistic craft</b><br>This phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of the skills given by God to Bezalel and Oholiab, the chief artisans of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a>). Their mastery over various crafts signifies the holistic approach required in serving God, where every talent and ability is used for His glory. This mastery can be seen as a reflection of the wisdom and creativity of God Himself, who is the ultimate Creator. The phrase also connects to the New Testament teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-6</a>, where diverse gifts are given by the same Spirit for the common good, emphasizing unity and purpose in the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman chosen by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle.
