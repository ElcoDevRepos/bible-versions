Pharaoh's refusal to release the Israelites despite numerous plagues demonstrates his resistance to God's will. This stubbornness is a fulfillment of God's earlier declaration to Moses that He would harden Pharaoh's heart (<a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>). It serves as a backdrop for God's power and sovereignty over earthly rulers, emphasizing that human obstinacy cannot thwart divine plans.<p><b>the LORD killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both of man and beast</b><br>The death of the firstborn was the tenth and final plague, a decisive act of judgment against Egypt's gods and Pharaoh, who was considered a deity. This event is pivotal in the Exodus story, leading to the liberation of the Israelites. It underscores the seriousness of sin and the cost of disobedience to God. The inclusion of both man and beast signifies a comprehensive judgment affecting all levels of Egyptian society and economy, highlighting the totality of God's power.<p><b>This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the firstborn male of every womb</b><br>The practice of sacrificing the firstborn male is rooted in the Passover event, serving as a perpetual reminder of God's deliverance. It reflects the principle of giving God the first and best, acknowledging His provision and sovereignty. This act of sacrifice is a form of worship and gratitude, reinforcing the covenant relationship between God and His people. It also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the firstborn over all creation (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>), who redeems humanity.<p><b>but I redeem all the firstborn of my sons.</b><br>Redemption of the firstborn sons involves a substitutionary act, where a sacrifice is made in place of the child. This practice points to the concept of redemption, a key theme in Scripture, where a price is paid for liberation. It foreshadows the redemptive work of Christ, who is the ultimate Redeemer. The act of redeeming the firstborn sons serves as a continual reminder of God's mercy and the cost of salvation, emphasizing the value God places on human life and His desire for relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who refused to release the Israelites from slavery, leading to the plagues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel who executed judgment on Egypt and delivered His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and from which they were delivered.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/firstborn.htm">Firstborn</a></b><br>Refers to the first male offspring, both human and animal, significant in the context of the Passover and God's deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifice_and_redemption.htm">Sacrifice and Redemption</a></b><br>The act of offering the firstborn to God as a remembrance of His deliverance and the redemption of the firstborn sons.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty and Judgment</a></b><br>Recognize God's authority over nations and His power to execute judgment.
