These, like the cloths here spoken of (<a href="/exodus/39-1.htm" title="And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Exodus 39:1</a>), were to be of blue, and purple, and scarlet; and it would be natural to distinguish them from the "holy garments," as is done both here and also in <a href="/exodus/35-19.htm" title="The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.">Exodus 35:19</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-1.htm" title="And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Exodus 39:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-41.htm" title="The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.">Exodus 39:41</a>.

Perhaps the true explanation is, that under the words "cloths of service" (<span class= "ital">bigdey s?rad, </span>or <span class= "ital">bigdeh hass?rad</span>) are included both the garments of Aaron and also those of his sons, the two later clauses of the verse being exegetical of the first clause.
