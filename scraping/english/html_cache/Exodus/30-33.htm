This exclusivity underscores the holiness and set-apart nature of the items and people associated with God's service. The prohibition against replicating this mixture highlights the importance of maintaining the sanctity of what is dedicated to God. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a call to purity and reverence in worship, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>, where unauthorized fire led to dire consequences for Nadab and Abihu.<p><b>or puts it on an outsider</b><br>The term "outsider" refers to anyone not consecrated for priestly service or not part of the covenant community of Israel. This restriction emphasizes the separation between the holy and the common, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. The anointing oil was a symbol of God's presence and blessing, and its misuse would desecrate what was meant to be holy. This concept of separation is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be distinct from the world (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><b>shall be cut off from his people.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "cut off from his people" indicates a severe penalty, often understood as excommunication or even death. This punishment reflects the seriousness with which God views the violation of His commands, especially those concerning holiness and worship. The idea of being "cut off" is a recurring theme in the Pentateuch, serving as a deterrent against disobedience and a means of preserving the purity of the community. In a typological sense, this foreshadows the ultimate separation from God that sin brings, which is reconciled through Jesus Christ, who restores believers to fellowship with God (<a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the laws and instructions from God on Mount Sinai, including the instructions for the anointing oil.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given specific laws and instructions to follow as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/anointing_oil.htm">Anointing Oil</a></b><br>A sacred mixture used for consecrating the priests and the tabernacle, symbolizing holiness and dedication to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where God dwelled among His people, requiring consecration and holiness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/layman.htm">Layman</a></b><br>A non-priestly member of the Israelite community, who was not permitted to use the sacred anointing oil.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_reverence.htm">Holiness and Reverence</a></b><br>The anointing oil was a symbol of holiness.
