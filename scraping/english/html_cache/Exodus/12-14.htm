The term "memorial" signifies a lasting remembrance, emphasizing the importance of recalling God's mighty acts. In biblical context, memorials often serve as reminders of God's faithfulness and covenant with His people, similar to the stones set up by Joshua after crossing the Jordan River (<a href="/joshua/4-7.htm">Joshua 4:7</a>).<p><b>and you are to celebrate it as a feast to the LORD</b><br>The celebration is not merely a cultural tradition but a religious observance dedicated to the LORD. The Passover feast involves specific rituals, including the sacrifice of a lamb, which prefigures Christ as the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). This feast underscores the theme of redemption and deliverance, central to the narrative of salvation history.<p><b>as a permanent statute</b><br>The term "permanent statute" indicates that this observance is to be kept perpetually by the Israelites. It highlights the enduring nature of God's commands and the importance of obedience. This concept of a lasting ordinance is echoed in other biblical feasts and laws, such as the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>).<p><b>for the generations to come</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the transmission of faith and tradition across generations. It underscores the responsibility of each generation to teach the next about God's deliverance and covenant. This idea is reinforced in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to diligently teach God's commandments to their children.
