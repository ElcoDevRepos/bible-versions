In the broader biblical context, this hardening of the heart is mentioned multiple times throughout the Exodus narrative. It serves to demonstrate God's sovereignty and power over human rulers and events. Theologically, it raises questions about free will and divine justice, but it is often interpreted as God allowing Pharaoh to persist in his own stubbornness, which he had already demonstrated. This hardening is part of God's plan to display His power and to fulfill His promise to Abraham about delivering his descendants from bondage (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>). It also foreshadows the hardening of hearts in the New Testament, where people reject Jesus despite witnessing His miracles (<a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37-40</a>).<p><b>and he was unwilling to let them go</b><br>Pharaoh's unwillingness to release the Israelites is a central theme in the Exodus story. This resistance sets the stage for the plagues that God sends upon Egypt, each demonstrating His supremacy over the Egyptian gods and Pharaoh himself, who was considered a deity. Historically, Egypt was a powerful empire, and the Israelites were a significant labor force, making Pharaoh's reluctance understandable from a human perspective. Culturally, the Egyptians viewed the Hebrews as inferior, which contributed to Pharaoh's dismissive attitude. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of liberation from bondage, which is a type of the spiritual liberation offered through Jesus Christ. Just as Pharaoh's refusal led to the eventual deliverance of Israel, the resistance of sin and death is overcome through Christ's sacrifice, offering freedom to all who believe (<a href="/romans/6-17.htm">Romans 6:17-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is actively involved in the deliverance of His people from Egypt.
