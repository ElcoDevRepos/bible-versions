Midian is a region east of the Sinai Peninsula, where Moses fled after killing an Egyptian (<a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>). It was here that Moses encountered God in the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3:1-4</a>). The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah (<a href="/genesis/25.htm">Genesis 25:1-2</a>), highlighting a connection to the broader Abrahamic covenant. This setting underscores Moses' transformation from a fugitive to a leader chosen by God.<p><b>Go back to Egypt</b><br>God's command to return to Egypt signifies a pivotal moment in Moses' life and the history of Israel. Egypt, a powerful and advanced civilization, was where the Israelites were enslaved. This directive marks the beginning of the fulfillment of God's promise to deliver His people (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>). Moses' return symbolizes obedience and faith, prefiguring Christ's mission to liberate humanity from sin.<p><b>for all the men who sought to kill you are dead</b><br>This assurance from God addresses Moses' fear of returning to Egypt due to his past actions (<a href="/exodus/2-14.htm">Exodus 2:14-15</a>). It reflects God's sovereignty and timing, ensuring Moses' safety. The phrase echoes God's protection and justice, similar to how He dealt with threats to Jesus' life (<a href="/matthew/2-19.htm">Matthew 2:19-20</a>). It also illustrates the theme of divine providence, where God removes obstacles to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who speaks directly to Moses, guiding and protecting him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader of the Israelites, who is in Midian at this time, having fled from Egypt after killing an Egyptian.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midian.htm">Midian</a></b><br>A region where Moses fled after leaving Egypt, and where he encountered God in the burning bush.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved and where Moses is being sent back to lead them out.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men_who_were_seeking_moses'_life.htm">The men who were seeking Moses' life</a></b><br>These were likely Egyptian authorities or individuals who wanted to punish Moses for killing an Egyptian.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_timing_and_protection.htm">Divine Timing and Protection</a></b><br>God&#8217;s timing is perfect.

It would seem that Moses was still reluctant, and was delaying his departure, even after he had obtained Jethro's leave to go. Perhaps he was making it an excuse to himself for not setting out that if he returned he might still suffer death on account of the offence which had driven him into exile. To remove this last impediment, God assured him that "all the men were dead who had sought his life." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/4-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
