The inclusion of Aaron's sons signifies the establishment of a hereditary priesthood, which was a common practice in ancient cultures. This act of presenting them highlights the importance of family lineage in the priestly duties, as seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as the Levitical priesthood. The presentation of the sons also foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers being presented to God as a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>and clothe them with tunics.</b><br>The tunics were part of the priestly garments, symbolizing purity and righteousness. Clothing in the Bible often represents one's status and role, and in this context, the tunics signify the sons' official induction into the priestly service. The act of clothing them can be seen as a type of Christ, who clothes believers in righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>). The tunics also connect to the broader biblical theme of God providing garments for His people, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a> when God clothed Adam and Eve.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to establish the covenantal laws, including the ordination of priests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, appointed as the first high priest of Israel.
