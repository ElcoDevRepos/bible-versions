In the ancient Near Eastern context, leaders often served as intermediaries between the divine and the people. Moses, chosen by God, fulfills this role by providing guidance and judgment based on divine revelation. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's governance, where God is the ultimate authority, and Moses acts as His representative. The people's approach to Moses signifies their recognition of his unique relationship with God and their dependence on divine wisdom for their communal and personal issues.<p><b>Moses replied.</b><br>Moses' response to Jethro, his father-in-law, indicates his awareness of his responsibilities and the burden they entail. Historically, Moses' leadership was characterized by direct communication with God, as seen in his encounters on Mount Sinai. This direct line to God set Moses apart from other leaders and prophets, establishing a pattern of prophetic leadership that would continue throughout Israel's history. Moses' role as a type of Christ is evident here, as both serve as mediators between God and humanity, providing guidance, teaching, and intercession. Moses' willingness to serve the people reflects the servant leadership that Jesus exemplifies in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egyptian bondage.

Because the people come unto me, to inquire of God</span>. To inquire of God is certainly not a mere "juridical phrase," meaning to consult a judge (Kalisch), nor, on the other hand, is it necessarily "to consult God through an oracle." It cannot, however, mean less than to seek a decision from some one regarded as entitled to speak for God; and it is certainly assigned by Moses as the reason why he judged all the causes himself, and did not devolve the duty upon others. They could not be supposed to know the mind of God as he knew it. Jethro, however, points out, that it is one thing to lay down principles, and another to apply them. Moses might reserve the legislative function - the inculcation of principles - to himself, and so still, "be for the people to Godward" (ver. 19); but he might find "able men" among the congregation, quite capable of applying the principles, and delegate to them the judicial function (vers. 21, 22). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/18-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">come</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">me to inquire</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7695;&#183;r&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1875.htm">Strong's 1875: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tread, frequent, to follow, to seek, ask, to worship</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of God,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/18-15.htm">Exodus 18:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/18-15.htm">Exodus 18:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/18-15.htm">Exodus 18:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/18-15.htm">Exodus 18:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/18-15.htm">Exodus 18:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/18-15.htm">Exodus 18:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/18-15.htm">Exodus 18:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/18-15.htm">Exodus 18:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/18-15.htm">Exodus 18:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/18-15.htm">Exodus 18:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/18-15.htm">OT Law: Exodus 18:15 Moses said to his father-in-law Because (Exo.
