In the context of ancient Israel, servitude was often a means of paying off debt or poverty. The law provided that a Hebrew servant would serve for six years and be released in the seventh year (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>). The emphasis on arriving alone underscores the personal nature of the servitude agreement. It highlights the principle of individual responsibility and the preservation of personal rights and status upon entering and exiting servitude. This reflects the broader biblical theme of justice and fairness in social and economic relationships.<p><b>he is to leave alone;</b><br>The stipulation that the servant leaves alone if he arrived alone ensures that his personal status and possessions remain unchanged by his period of servitude. This provision protects the servant from losing personal relationships or property due to his temporary economic condition. It also reflects the biblical principle of restoration and redemption, where individuals are restored to their original state after a period of trial or service. This can be seen as a type of the ultimate redemption found in Christ, who restores believers to their intended state before God.<p><b>if he arrived with a wife,</b><br>The mention of a wife indicates that the servant's family status is recognized and respected. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, family units were integral to social and economic life. The law acknowledges the servant's marital status and ensures that his family is not disrupted by his servitude. This reflects the biblical emphasis on the sanctity of marriage and the family unit, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where a man and woman become one flesh.<p><b>she is to leave with him.</b><br>This provision ensures that the servant's wife, who may have shared in his economic hardship, is also released with him. It underscores the protection of family integrity and unity, even in situations of economic distress. This reflects the biblical theme of covenant faithfulness, where God remains faithful to His people and their families. The protection of the family unit can also be seen as a type of the Church, the bride of Christ, who is united with Him and shares in His redemption and inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrew_servant.htm">Hebrew Servant</a></b><br>The subject of the law in <a href="/exodus/21-3.htm">Exodus 21:3</a>, referring to a Hebrew man who has sold himself into servitude, typically due to debt or poverty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wife.htm">Wife</a></b><br>The wife of the Hebrew servant, who is mentioned in the context of the servant's release.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received and communicated God's laws, including those in <a href="/bsb/exodus/21.htm">Exodus 21</a>, to the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the laws from God, including the laws concerning servants.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom these laws were given, forming the context of the covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_servitude_in_ancient_israel.htm">Understanding Servitude in Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The servitude described in <a href="/bsb/exodus/21.htm">Exodus 21</a> was not akin to modern understandings of slavery but was often a means of survival and debt repayment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_marriage.htm">The Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>The law acknowledges the bond of marriage, ensuring that a servant's marital status is respected and preserved upon his release.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_compassion.htm">God's Justice and Compassion</a></b><br>These laws reflect God's concern for justice and compassion, ensuring that even those in servitude are treated with dignity and fairness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_freedom.htm">The Principle of Freedom</a></b><br>The release of servants after a period of service points to a broader biblical theme of freedom and redemption, ultimately fulfilled in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/application_to_modern_life.htm">Application to Modern Life</a></b><br>While the cultural context has changed, the principles of justice, compassion, and respect for family relationships remain relevant today.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_21_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 21:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_3_God_s_justice_in_servitude.htm">How does Exodus 21:3 reflect God's justice in servitude laws?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_if_he_came_alone_show_responsibility.htm">What does "if he came alone" teach about personal responsibility?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_3_s_impact_on_work_today.htm">How can Exodus 21:3 guide Christians in modern employment practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_3_and_Jesus_on_servanthood.htm">How does Exodus 21:3 connect to Jesus' teachings on servanthood?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_3_s_family_unity_principles.htm">What principles from Exodus 21:3 apply to maintaining family unity today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_3_s_cultural_context.htm">How does Exodus 21:3 reflect the cultural context of ancient Israelite society?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_21_3_on_biblical_freedom_value.htm">What does Exodus 21:3 reveal about the value of individual freedom in biblical times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Modern_view_on_Exodus_21_3_laws.htm">How should modern Christians interpret the laws in Exodus 21:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_was_zipporah_in_the_bible.htm">Who was Zipporah in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_oral_sex.htm">What is the Bible's stance on oral sex?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_was_jael_and_what_did_she_do.htm">Who was Jael and what did she do?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_allow_slavery_in_exodus.htm">The Old Testament allows slavery (Exodus 21:2-11);
