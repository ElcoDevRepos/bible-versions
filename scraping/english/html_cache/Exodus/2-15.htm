The Pharaoh at this time is likely Thutmose III or another ruler of the 18th Dynasty. The Pharaoh's reaction indicates the seriousness of Moses' actions and the threat he posed to the Egyptian authority. This reflects the tension between the Hebrews and Egyptians, as well as the growing awareness of Moses' identity and his connection to the Hebrew people.<p><b>he sought to kill Moses</b><br>Pharaoh's intent to kill Moses underscores the severity of Moses' crime in the eyes of the Egyptian ruler. It also highlights the political and social dynamics of the time, where a member of the royal household could not act against the state without severe repercussions. This mirrors the later New Testament account of Herod seeking to kill Jesus as a child, showing a pattern of rulers attempting to eliminate perceived threats to their power.<p><b>But Moses fled from Pharaoh</b><br>Moses' flight to Midian marks a significant turning point in his life. It demonstrates his awareness of the danger he faced and his decision to leave behind his Egyptian upbringing. This act of fleeing is a precursor to the Exodus, where Moses will later lead the Israelites out of Egypt. It also parallels the flight of other biblical figures, such as Jacob fleeing from Esau and David fleeing from Saul, showing a recurring theme of God's chosen leaders facing trials and seeking refuge.<p><b>and settled in the land of Midian</b><br>Midian is located in the northwestern region of the Arabian Peninsula, near the Gulf of Aqaba. The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through his wife Keturah, making them distant relatives of the Israelites. This connection is significant as it provides Moses with a place of refuge and a new beginning. The land of Midian becomes a place of preparation for Moses, where he will spend 40 years before returning to Egypt to lead the Exodus.<p><b>where he sat down beside a well</b><br>Wells in the ancient Near East were vital sources of water and often served as communal gathering places. This setting is reminiscent of other biblical encounters at wells, such as those involving Rebekah, Rachel, and Jesus with the Samaritan woman. The well symbolizes a place of divine appointment and provision. For Moses, sitting by the well signifies a moment of rest and reflection, as well as the beginning of his integration into Midianite society, where he will soon meet his future wife, Zipporah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who sought to kill Moses after learning of his actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew by birth, raised in Pharaoh's household, who fled Egypt after killing an Egyptian.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midian.htm">Midian</a></b><br>A region where Moses sought refuge, located east of the Red Sea, inhabited by the Midianites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_well.htm">The Well</a></b><br>A significant location in Midian where Moses rested and later met the daughters of Jethro.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence_in_adversity.htm">Divine Providence in Adversity</a></b><br>Moses' flight to Midian demonstrates God's providential care, even in dire circumstances.

The administration of justice was one of the chief duties of the royal office; and the crime committed by Moses was one to be punished by death. There was nothing to reduce it from murder to manslaughter. And the motives which extenuate it in the eyes of moderns--patriotic zeal and hatred of oppression--would not have commanded the sympathies of a Pharaoh.<p><span class= "bld">Moses fled.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">had fled. </span>Moses would fly as soon as he found his act was known.

If we have been right in supposing the Pharaoh of the original oppression to have been Seti I., the present Pharaoh, from whom Moses flies when he is "full forty years old" (<a href="/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a>), and who does not die till Moses is near eighty, must be his son, the Great Rameses, Rameses II. This prince was associated by his father at the age of ten or twelve (Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. 2. pp. 24-5), and reigned sixty-seven years, as appears from his monuments. He is the only king of the New Empire whose real reign exceeded forty years, and thus the only monarch who fulfils the conditions required by the narrative of Exodus supplemented by St. Stephen's speech in the Acts. He sought to slay Moses. We need not understand from this expression that the Pharaoh's will was thwarted or opposed by anything but the sudden disappearance of Moses. As St. Stephen says (<a href="/acts/7-29.htm">Acts 7:29</a>), "Then fled Moses <span class="accented">at this saying</span>," <span class="accented">i.e</span>. at the mere words of the aggressor, "Writ thou slay me as thou didst the Egyptian?" Moses fled, knowing what he had to expect, quitted Egypt, went to Midian; and the Egyptian monarch "sought to slay him" too late. <span class="cmt_word">The land of Midian</span> is a somewhat vague expression, for the Midianites were nomads, and at different times occupied distinct and even remote localities. Their principal settlements appear to have been on the eastern side of the Elanitic Gulf (Gulf of Akabah); but at times they extended northwards to the confines of Moab (<a href="/genesis/36-35.htm">Genesis 36:35</a>; <a href="/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4, 7</a>, etc.), and westward into the Sinaitic peninsula, which appears to have been "the land of Midian whereto Moses fled (see below, <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>). The Midianites are not expressly mentioned in the Egyptian inscriptions. They were probably included among the Mentu, with whom the Egyptians contended in the Sinaitic region, and from whom they took the copper district north-west of Sinai. <span class="cmt_word">And he sat down by a well</span>. Rather "and he <span class="accented">dwelt</span> by <span class="accented">the</span> well." He took up his abode in the neighbourhood of the principal well belonging to the tract here called Midian. The tract was probably one of no great size, an offshoot of the greater Midian on the other side of the gulf.
