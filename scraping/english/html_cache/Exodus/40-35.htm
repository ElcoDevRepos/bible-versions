The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the designated place where God would meet with His people. This inability to enter signifies the overwhelming presence of God, which even Moses, who had previously spoken with God face to face (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>), could not withstand. It underscores the holiness and separateness of God, emphasizing that even the most revered leaders must approach Him with reverence and awe.<p><b>because the cloud had settled on it</b><br>The cloud represents the Shekinah glory, a visible manifestation of God's presence. Throughout the Israelites' journey in the wilderness, the cloud guided them by day (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). Its settling on the Tent of Meeting signifies God's approval and His dwelling among His people. This cloud is a recurring symbol of divine presence, seen also at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>) and later in the dedication of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). It serves as a reminder of God's guidance and protection.<p><b>and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle</b><br>The glory of the LORD, often associated with light and radiance, filled the tabernacle, indicating God's complete and overwhelming presence. This filling of the tabernacle is a fulfillment of God's promise to dwell among His people (<a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45-46</a>). It prefigures the incarnation of Christ, where the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The tabernacle, as a type of Christ, points to the ultimate dwelling of God with humanity through Jesus. This event also foreshadows the New Testament reality where believers, as the body of Christ, become the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

The moment underscores that access to God is always on His terms, not ours&#8212;an idea later echoed when only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies once a year (<a href="/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>).<p>&#8226;

The settled cloud signals that God has accepted the tabernacle exactly as He commanded (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; It also serves as a visible boundary: when the cloud rests, everyone&#8212;including Moses&#8212;stops (<a href="/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle&#8221;</b><p>&#8226;
