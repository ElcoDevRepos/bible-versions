Her actions demonstrate a protective and watchful role, indicative of familial loyalty and concern. In the cultural context of ancient Egypt, family bonds were crucial for survival, especially under oppressive conditions. Miriam's vigilance reflects the importance of women in biblical narratives, often acting as protectors and deliverers. This moment foreshadows her later role as a leader among the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20-21</a>).<p><b>to see what would happen to him.</b><br>This phrase highlights the uncertainty and danger surrounding Moses' early life. The decree of Pharaoh to kill all Hebrew male infants (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>) sets the backdrop for this tense moment. Miriam's watchfulness is an act of faith, trusting in God's providence for her brother's safety. This scene prefigures the deliverance theme central to Moses' life and mission. It also parallels the New Testament account of Mary and Joseph protecting Jesus from Herod's decree (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13-15</a>), emphasizing God's sovereignty and protection over His chosen deliverers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses'_sister.htm">Moses' Sister (Miriam)</a></b><br>The sister of Moses, who is later identified as Miriam.
