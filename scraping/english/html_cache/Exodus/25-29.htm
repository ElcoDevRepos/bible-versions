These items were not merely functional but held significant symbolic meaning, representing the sustenance provided by God to His people. The use of plates and dishes in the Tabernacle underscores the importance of order and reverence in worship. The showbread, also known as the "bread of the Presence," was a continual offering before the Lord, symbolizing God's perpetual covenant with Israel. This practice is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus refers to Himself as the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), indicating that He is the ultimate sustenance for believers.<p><b>as well as the pitchers and bowls for pouring drink offerings</b><br>The pitchers and bowls were used for the drink offerings, which accompanied various sacrifices. These offerings were typically wine, symbolizing joy and the outpouring of life. The drink offering was poured out at the base of the altar, signifying the complete dedication of the offering to God. This act of pouring out is a precursor to the New Testament concept of being "poured out" as a drink offering, as seen in Paul's writings (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>), where he describes his life as being fully dedicated to God's service. The drink offerings in the Old Testament foreshadow the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, whose blood was poured out for the remission of sins.<p><b>Make them out of pure gold</b><br>The use of pure gold for these items highlights the holiness and sanctity of the Tabernacle and its furnishings. Gold, being a precious and incorruptible metal, symbolizes the divine nature and glory of God. The requirement for pure gold indicates that the worship of God must be conducted with the utmost purity and excellence. This reflects the heavenly reality, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>, where the New Jerusalem is depicted as having streets of pure gold. The use of gold in the Tabernacle points to the eternal and unchanging nature of God's covenant with His people and prefigures the glory of Christ, who is described as having a divine and incorruptible nature (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions for the Tabernacle from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where God dwelled among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were on their way to the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where Moses received the Ten Commandments and the detailed instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/drink_offerings.htm">Drink Offerings</a></b><br>Ritual offerings made to God, often involving the pouring out of wine, symbolizing dedication and worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_holiness.htm">The Importance of Holiness</a></b><br>The use of pure gold for the utensils signifies the holiness and purity required in worship.
