Their actions demonstrate faith and trust in God's plan, a recurring theme throughout the Bible. Obedience to divine commands is a central tenet in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings are promised for obedience. This act of obedience also prefigures Christ's perfect obedience to the Father, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>.<p><b>in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials,</b><br>The presence of Pharaoh and his officials signifies the public nature of this miracle. It was not done in secret but was a direct challenge to the authority and power of Egypt. Pharaoh, considered a god by the Egyptians, is confronted with the power of the true God. This public display is reminiscent of Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>, where God's power is demonstrated before the people.<p><b>Aaron raised the staff and struck the water of the Nile,</b><br>The staff is a symbol of God's authority and power, first introduced in <a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2-4</a> when God turns it into a serpent. The Nile River was the lifeblood of Egypt, essential for agriculture and daily life. Striking the Nile with the staff signifies God's control over creation and judgment against the Egyptian gods, particularly Hapi, the god of the Nile. This act foreshadows Christ's authority over nature, as seen in His calming of the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>.<p><b>and all the water was turned to blood.</b><br>The transformation of water into blood is the first of the ten plagues, each targeting specific aspects of Egyptian life and their pantheon of gods. Blood symbolizes life and death, and this plague signifies judgment and the beginning of God's deliverance of Israel. This event prefigures the blood of Christ, which brings both judgment and salvation, as seen in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>, which states that without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.

Moses and Aaron &#8220;did just as the LORD had commanded&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>).<p>- Obedience was not optional; it was the channel through which God&#8217;s power flowed. Compare <a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>, where Noah &#8220;did everything that God had commanded him,&#8221; and <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, where Jesus says, &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.&#8221;<p>- Their faith expressed itself in action, trusting that the LORD&#8217;s word would accomplish what He promised (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the presence of Pharaoh and his officials</b><p>- The act was public, confronting Egypt&#8217;s highest authority. God wanted Pharaoh to see firsthand that the God of Israel held power over Egypt&#8217;s prized river.<p>- Similar public displays appear in <a href="/bsb/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>, when Elijah called down fire before the prophets of Baal, and in <a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13&#8211;14</a>, where Peter and John healed a man before the Sanhedrin.<p>- The confrontation fulfilled God&#8217;s earlier word in <a href="/exodus/7-4.htm">Exodus 7:4</a> that He would &#8220;lay My hand on Egypt&#8221; and compel acknowledgment of His sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Aaron raised the staff and struck the water</b><p>- Aaron&#8217;s staff symbolized God&#8217;s delegated authority (<a href="/exodus/4-17.htm">Exodus 4:17</a>). Each use of the staff&#8212;turning into a serpent (<a href="/exodus/7-10.htm">Exodus 7:10</a>) and now striking the Nile&#8212;reinforced that the power belonged to God, not the men.<p>- Striking recalls the later miracle in <a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>, when Moses struck the rock and water flowed out&#8212;again, a tangible sign that God commands nature.<p>- This action dismantled Egypt&#8217;s trust in the Nile as a life-source and as a deity (e.g., their god Hapi). <a href="/romans/1-23.htm">Romans 1:23&#8211;25</a> shows how God exposes false worship by confronting idols.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the water was turned to blood</b><p>- The transformation was total: &#8220;all the water of the Nile&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>). Not symbolism, but a literal miracle.<p>- The judgment mirrored <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>, where blood cried out from the ground&#8212;here Egypt&#8217;s lifeblood river cried out against oppression.<p>- <a href="/revelation/16-3.htm">Revelation 16:3&#8211;6</a> echoes this plague in the final judgments, underscoring that God&#8217;s justice spans Scripture.<p>- The Nile turning to blood also previewed the Passover, when blood would mean both judgment and deliverance (<a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a> records obedient servants acting publicly under God&#8217;s authority to confront a false power, resulting in a miraculous, literal judgment that exposed Egypt&#8217;s idolatry and affirmed the LORD&#8217;s supremacy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">He lifted up the rod.</span>--"He" is, undoubtedly, Aaron.
