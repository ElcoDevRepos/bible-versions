It reflects the ongoing relationship between God and Moses, where God provides guidance and instructions. This communication is consistent with other instances in the Pentateuch where God speaks directly to Moses, such as in <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a> at the burning bush.<p><b>Walk on ahead of the people</b><br>Moses is instructed to lead, signifying his leadership and the trust God places in him. This action also serves as a test of faith for the Israelites, who are in a state of complaint and doubt. Walking ahead symbolizes moving forward in faith, a recurring theme in the journey of the Israelites.<p><b>and take some of the elders of Israel with you</b><br>The inclusion of the elders serves multiple purposes: it provides witnesses to the miracle that is about to occur, it reinforces the authority of Moses among the people, and it involves the leadership structure of Israel in God's plan. The elders represent the tribes and are often seen as mediators between Moses and the people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>.<p><b>Take along in your hand the staff</b><br>The staff is a symbol of God's power and authority, previously used by Moses to perform miracles in Egypt, such as turning the Nile into blood (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>). It represents God's presence and the divine authority given to Moses. The staff is a recurring symbol throughout the Exodus narrative, signifying God's intervention and support.<p><b>with which you struck the Nile</b><br>This reference to the past miracle in Egypt serves as a reminder of God's power and faithfulness. It connects the current situation to the past deliverance from Egypt, reinforcing the idea that the same God who performed miracles in Egypt is still with them. It also serves as a reminder of judgment and deliverance, themes central to the Exodus story.<p><b>and go</b><br>The command to "go" is an imperative, urging immediate action and obedience. It reflects the urgency of the situation, as the Israelites are in desperate need of water. This command is similar to other instances where God instructs His servants to act promptly, such as in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a> when God tells Abram to leave his country.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who guides and provides for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and lead them through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elders_of_israel.htm">The Elders of Israel</a></b><br>Representatives of the Israelite community, signifying leadership and witness to God's actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_staff.htm">The Staff</a></b><br>A symbol of God's power and authority, previously used by Moses to perform miracles, such as striking the Nile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_rephidim.htm">The Wilderness of Rephidim</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites camped and experienced a lack of water, leading to their complaints against Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithful_guidance.htm">God's Faithful Guidance</a></b><br>God provides clear instructions to His leaders, ensuring His people are cared for even in dire circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbol_of_authority.htm">Symbol of Authority</a></b><br>The staff represents God's authority and power.
