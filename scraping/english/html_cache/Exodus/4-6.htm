It highlights the authority of God in guiding Moses, who is chosen to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. This divine encounter occurs at Mount Horeb, also known as Mount Sinai, a significant location for future events in Israel's history, including the giving of the Ten Commandments.<p><b>&#8220;Put your hand inside your cloak.&#8221;</b><br>The instruction to place his hand inside his cloak is a command that requires obedience and trust. The cloak, a common garment in ancient Near Eastern culture, symbolizes protection and covering. This act foreshadows the miraculous signs God will perform through Moses, demonstrating His power and authority. It also serves as a test of faith for Moses, who must act without knowing the outcome.<p><b>So he put his hand inside his cloak,</b><br>Moses' compliance with God's command reflects his willingness to follow divine instructions, despite his initial hesitations about his mission. This obedience is crucial for his role as a leader and prophet. The act of placing his hand inside the cloak is a simple yet profound demonstration of faith, setting a precedent for future acts of obedience required of him.<p><b>and when he took it out,</b><br>The removal of the hand signifies the revelation of God's power. This moment of unveiling is pivotal, as it transitions from a hidden act to a visible sign. It parallels other biblical instances where hidden things are revealed, such as the uncovering of hidden sins or the revelation of God's plans.<p><b>his hand was leprous, white as snow.</b><br>The transformation of Moses' hand into a leprous state serves as a powerful sign of God's ability to control health and disease, a common theme in biblical narratives. Leprosy, a feared and isolating disease in ancient times, symbolizes impurity and separation. The whiteness "as snow" emphasizes the severity and unmistakable nature of the condition. This sign prefigures the cleansing and healing power of God, as seen in the ministry of Jesus Christ, who healed lepers and restored them to community. The imagery of leprosy also connects to themes of sin and purification, underscoring the need for divine intervention to cleanse and restore.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is called by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

When it is fully developed, the whole skin appears glossy white, and every hair is "white like wool" (Celsus, <span class= "ital">De Re Medica, </span>v. 28, ? 12). This form is said to be absolutely incurable. It was probably from the fact of Moses exhibiting a leprous hand that the Egyptians called the Israelites "the lepers," as related by Manetho (<span class= "ital">ap. </span>Joseph. <span class= "ital">contra Ap. i.</span> 26), Chaeremon (<span class= "ital">ibid., </span>i. 32), and others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Furthermore</span>. The first sign is followed by a second, equally simple and easy of performance, and perhaps, in the eyes of the Israelites, even more marvellous. Leprosy in a developed form was regarded as absolutely incurable. (Celsus, 'De Re Medica,' 5:7-8.) Its instantaneous production and removal were contrary to all experience, and in themselves thoroughly astonishing. Further, while the first miracle was simply a sign of supernatural power - a credential, the second was a warning and a lesson. What might not he do to smite or to save on whom God had bestowed such power over the human organism? Each man would naturally fear to resist or disobey one so dangerously gifted. <span class="cmt_word">Leprous as snow</span>. The Greek name for the worst form of leprosy, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, was based on this fact of whiteness. The loathsome disease is thus described by Kalisch: - "It begins with mealy crusts and scurfy scabs, originally not larger than a pin's point, a little depressed in the skin (<a href="/leviticus/13-3.htm">Leviticus 13:3, 30</a>), and covered with white hairs (<span class="accented">ib</span>. 3, 20). These spots rapidly spread (<span class="accented">ib</span>. 8), and produce wild [proud?] flesh (<span class="accented">ib</span>. 10, 14). The leprous symptoms appear most frequently on the hairy parts of the body, and also on members which have been ulcerously affected. When the leprosy has gained ground, <span class="accented">the whole skin appears glossy white</span> at the forehead, nose, etc., tuberated, thickened, dry like leather, but smooth; sometimes it bursts, and ulcers become visible. The nails of the hands and feet fall; the eyelids bend backwards; the hair covers itself with a fetid rind, or goes off entirely (<a href="/leviticus/13-42.htm">Leviticus 13:42</a>). All external senses are weakened: the eyes lose their brightness, become very sensitive, and are continually blearing; from the nostrils runs a fluid phlegm."
