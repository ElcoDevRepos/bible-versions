It reflects the biblical principle of teaching children about God's works and commandments, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>. The question anticipates a time when the miraculous events of the Exodus might not be directly experienced by the descendants, highlighting the need for oral tradition and remembrance. This practice of questioning and answering is a key element in Jewish Passover traditions, where the youngest child asks about the significance of the rituals.<p><b>you are to tell him,</b><br>This directive underscores the responsibility of parents to educate their children in the faith. It is a call to active participation in the spiritual upbringing of the next generation. The act of telling is not just about conveying information but also about instilling faith and identity. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>, which advises training a child in the way they should go.<p><b>&#8216;With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt,</b><br>The phrase "with a mighty hand" signifies God's powerful intervention in history. It is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing God's strength and sovereignty (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>). The deliverance from Egypt is a foundational event for Israel, symbolizing salvation and liberation. This act of God is a type of Christ's redemptive work, where Jesus delivers believers from the bondage of sin, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-14</a>).<p><b>out of the house of slavery.</b><br>This phrase highlights the condition from which the Israelites were delivered. Egypt is often symbolically associated with bondage and oppression. The "house of slavery" represents not just physical captivity but also spiritual and moral enslavement. This deliverance prefigures the ultimate liberation through Christ, who frees humanity from the slavery of sin (<a href="/romans/6-17.htm">Romans 6:17-18</a>). The historical context of Egyptian slavery provides a backdrop for understanding the depth of God's salvation and the transformation from bondage to freedom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who delivered His people from slavery in Egypt with great power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to bring the Israelites out of Egypt and to communicate God's laws and instructions to them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were enslaved in Egypt and delivered by God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved, representing bondage and oppression.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The event of God delivering the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, a foundational moment in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembrance.htm">The Importance of Remembrance</a></b><br>Remembering God's mighty acts is crucial for maintaining faith and obedience.
