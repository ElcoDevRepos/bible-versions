This ascent signifies a deeper communion with God, a recurring theme in Moses' life. The mountain is a place of divine revelation, echoing other biblical instances where God reveals Himself on mountains, such as the Transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>).<p><b>with Aaron</b><br>Aaron, Moses' brother, serves as the high priest and is a key figure in the spiritual leadership of Israel. His inclusion signifies the priestly role in mediating between God and the people, foreshadowing the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>).<p><b>Nadab and Abihu</b><br>These are Aaron's sons, representing the priestly lineage. Their presence highlights the importance of priestly succession and the sanctity required in approaching God.

It pleased God, however, to terminate the whole transaction by a closing scene of extraordinary grandeur, beauty, and spiritual significance. A sacrifice implied a sacrificial meal (<a href="/exodus/18-12.htm" title="And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.">Exodus 18:12</a>). Moses understood that God, by summoning Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders into the mount (<a href="/exodus/24-1.htm" title="And he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship you afar off.">Exodus 24:1</a>), had intended the sacrificial meal to be held there; and accordingly, as soon as he had sprinkled the people, ascended Sinai with the persons summoned, and had the feast prepared. A sacrificial meal was always regarded as a religious act--an act done "before God" (<a href="/exodus/18-12.htm" title="And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.">Exodus 18:12</a>), involving communion with Him. God willed now to signalise this sacrificial feast above all others by making His presence not only felt but <span class= "ital">seen. </span>As Moses, Aaron with his two sons, and the elders were engaged in the feast (<a href="/exodus/24-11.htm" title="And on the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.">Exodus 24:11</a>), a vision of marvellous splendour broke upon them. "They saw the God of Israel" (<a href="/exodus/24-10.htm" title="And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.">Exodus 24:10</a>). God showed Himself to them--not, as before, amid thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud, and fire, and smoke, and earthquake (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm" title="And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm" title="And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.">Exodus 19:18</a>), but in His loveliness (<a href="/songs/5-16.htm" title="His mouth is most sweet: yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.">Song of Solomon 5:16</a>) and His beauty, standing on pellucid sapphire, blue as the blue of heaven. They "saw God," and were neither hurt nor even terrified; they could, while seeing Him, still eat and drink--they felt themselves like guests at His board, as if He were banqueting with them. So was impressed upon them the mild and sweet relation into which they were brought towards God by covenant--a covenant made, and not yet infringed. The gentle, lovely, attractive side of God's character was shewn to them, instead of the awful and alarming one; and they were taught to look forward to a final state of bliss, in which God's covenanted servants would dwell in His presence continually. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-11.</span> - THE SACRIFICIAL FEAST AND THE VISION OF GOD. After the covenant had been ratified by the unanimous voice of the people, Moses proceeded to carry out the injunctions with respect to Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the elders, which he had received while still in the mount (see the comment on vers. 1, 2). Taking them with him, he ascended Sinai once more to a certain height, but clearly not to the summit, which he alone was privileged to visit (vers. 2 and 12). The object of the ascent was twofold. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> A sacrificial meal always followed upon a sacrifice; and the elders might naturally desire to partake of it as near the Divine presence as should be permitted them. This was their purpose in ascending. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> God desired to impress them with a sense of his awful majesty and beauty, and was prepared for this end to manifest himself to them in some strange and wonderful way as they were engaged in the solemn meal (ver. 11). This was his purpose in inviting their presence. The manifestation is described in ver. 10. It was a "vision of God," but of what exact nature it is impossible to say. Having recorded it, the author parenthetically notes that the Divine vision did not destroy any of those who beheld it, or cause them any injury, as might have been expected. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then went up</span>.
