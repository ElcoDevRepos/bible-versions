The term "father" can be understood as a reference to Moses' immediate ancestors, linking Moses to the faith of his forebears. It emphasizes the personal and familial nature of God's relationship with His people, underscoring the idea that God is not a distant deity but one who is intimately involved in the lives of His followers.<p><b>the God of Abraham,</b><br>By identifying Himself as the God of Abraham, God recalls the covenant promises made to Abraham, including the promise of land, descendants, and blessing to all nations (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). This connection reinforces the idea of faith and obedience, as Abraham is often cited as a model of faith (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8-12</a>). It also highlights the fulfillment of God's promises through the lineage of Abraham, which ultimately points to the coming of Jesus Christ, a descendant of Abraham (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><b>the God of Isaac,</b><br>Mentioning Isaac reaffirms the continuation of the covenant through Abraham's son. Isaac's life is marked by God's provision and faithfulness, such as the miraculous birth to Sarah and the sparing of his life on Mount Moriah (Genesis 22). Isaac's role in the lineage of the covenant people underscores the theme of God's faithfulness across generations.<p><b>and the God of Jacob.&#8221;</b><br>Jacob, later named Israel, is the father of the twelve tribes of Israel. His life is a testament to God's grace and transformative power, as seen in his journey from deceit to becoming a patriarch of the nation of Israel. The mention of Jacob connects Moses to the broader narrative of Israel's history and God's ongoing work among His chosen people. It also foreshadows the nation of Israel's role in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>At this, Moses hid his face,</b><br>Moses' reaction of hiding his face is a response of reverence and fear in the presence of the divine. This act reflects the biblical understanding of God's holiness and the human recognition of unworthiness before Him. It is reminiscent of other biblical figures who respond similarly to divine encounters, such as Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13</a>).<p><b>for he was afraid to look at God.</b><br>The fear of looking at God underscores the awe-inspiring and overwhelming nature of God's presence. In the ancient Near Eastern context, seeing a deity was often associated with danger or death, as the divine was considered too holy for mortal eyes. This fear is consistent with later biblical teachings that emphasize God's holiness and the need for mediation, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who provides access to God (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The self-existent, eternal God who reveals Himself to Moses.
