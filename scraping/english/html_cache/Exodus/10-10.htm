His interactions with Moses and Aaron are central to the narrative of the Exodus, showcasing the struggle between divine authority and human obstinacy. This phrase sets the stage for Pharaoh's continued resistance to God's command to let the Israelites go.<p><b>&#8220;May the LORD be with you</b><br>This statement is likely sarcastic, as Pharaoh does not genuinely invoke the LORD's blessing. It reflects the tension between Pharaoh's authority and the power of the God of Israel. The irony is that the LORD is indeed with Moses and the Israelites, guiding them through the plagues and ultimately leading them to freedom.<p><b>if I ever let you go with your little ones.</b><br>Pharaoh's reluctance to let the Israelites leave with their families highlights his desire to maintain control over them. By keeping the children, Pharaoh aims to ensure the return of the adults, thus preserving his labor force. This reflects the broader theme of bondage and liberation that runs throughout the Exodus narrative.<p><b>Clearly you are bent on evil.</b><br>Pharaoh accuses Moses and Aaron of having malicious intent, projecting his own hardened heart onto them. This accusation is unfounded, as Moses and Aaron are acting under God's command. The statement underscores Pharaoh's misunderstanding of God's purpose and the righteousness of the Israelites' cause. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of the righteous being misunderstood or persecuted by those in power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who is obstinate and refuses to let the Israelites go, despite the plagues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>The leaders of the Israelites, chosen by God to demand their freedom from Pharaoh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, enslaved in Egypt, seeking freedom to worship God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, experiencing God's plagues as a result of Pharaoh's hardened heart.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plagues.htm">The Plagues</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments on Egypt, demonstrating God's power and sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_hardness_of_heart.htm">The Hardness of Heart</a></b><br>Pharaoh's response exemplifies a heart hardened against God's will.
