The number five often symbolizes grace in biblical numerology, suggesting that the Tabernacle was a place where God's grace was manifest. The curtains were made of fine linen, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and were embroidered with cherubim, indicating the heavenly nature of the Tabernacle. This act of joining reflects the meticulous obedience to God's instructions given to Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/26.htm">Exodus 26:1-6</a>). The curtains' unity can be seen as a type of the unity of the body of Christ, the Church, as described in <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>.<p><b>and the other five he joined as well</b><br>The repetition of joining the other five curtains emphasizes the importance of symmetry and order in God's design. This mirrors the creation narrative where God brings order out of chaos. The Tabernacle's structure, with its precise measurements and arrangements, reflects God's nature as a God of order and detail. Historically, the Tabernacle served as a portable sanctuary during the Israelites' wilderness journey, symbolizing God's presence and guidance. The joining of the curtains can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Covenant, where Christ's sacrifice would bring together Jews and Gentiles into one body (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>). The act of joining signifies the coming together of God's people in worship and service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel_and_oholiab.htm">Bezalel and Oholiab</a></b><br>Skilled craftsmen appointed by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were tasked with contributing materials and labor for the construction of the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites wandered for 40 years and where the Tabernacle was constructed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>Just as the curtains were joined to form a single Tabernacle, believers are called to unity in the body of Christ, despite diverse gifts and roles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>The meticulous following of God's instructions for the Tabernacle construction serves as a model for our obedience to God's Word in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_community.htm">The Importance of Community</a></b><br>The construction of the Tabernacle required the collective effort of the Israelites, reminding us of the importance of community and collaboration in fulfilling God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_dwelling_among_us.htm">God's Dwelling Among Us</a></b><br>The Tabernacle symbolizes God's desire to dwell among His people, pointing forward to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/attention_to_detail_in_worship.htm">Attention to Detail in Worship</a></b><br>The detailed construction of the Tabernacle reflects the importance of reverence and care in our worship and service to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_36_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 36:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_36_10_Unity_in_God_s_work.htm">How does Exodus 36:10 demonstrate the importance of unity in God's work?
