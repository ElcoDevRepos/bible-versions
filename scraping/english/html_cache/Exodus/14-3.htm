His perspective is limited to human understanding and political power. This phrase indicates Pharaoh's assumption about the Israelites' situation, reflecting his lack of awareness of God's plan. Pharaoh's perception is a reminder of the spiritual blindness that can accompany pride and resistance to God. This echoes earlier instances where Pharaoh's heart was hardened (<a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>), showing a pattern of misunderstanding God's intentions.<p><b>&#8216;They are wandering the land in confusion;</b><br>The Israelites' journey through the wilderness may have appeared aimless to Pharaoh, but it was divinely guided. This phrase highlights the difference between human perception and divine reality. The Israelites were following God's pillar of cloud and fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>), which provided direction and protection. This misunderstanding by Pharaoh is reminiscent of how God's ways are often inscrutable to those who do not know Him (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The perceived confusion is part of God's strategy to demonstrate His power and deliverance.<p><b>the wilderness has boxed them in.&#8217;</b><br>Geographically, the Israelites were encamped by the sea, with the wilderness surrounding them, creating a seemingly inescapable situation. This setting was part of God's plan to display His glory through a miraculous deliverance. The wilderness represents a place of testing and dependence on God, as seen throughout Israel's journey. This situation foreshadows the Red Sea crossing, a type of baptism and deliverance, prefiguring Christ's victory over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>). The phrase underscores the theme of God making a way where there seems to be none, a recurring motif in Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/43-16.htm">Isaiah 43:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, who is a central figure in the account of the Exodus.

Scripture often emphasizes God&#8217;s ability to declare &#8220;the end from the beginning&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>). Because the Lord sees every thought (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1&#8211;4</a>), He can weave those thoughts into His redemptive purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the Israelites</b><p>Pharaoh&#8217;s words center on God&#8217;s covenant people. From the burning bush forward, the Lord consistently calls them &#8220;My people&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). To Pharaoh, they are an expendable workforce he has just lost; to God, they are a treasured possession being led to freedom (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The contrast highlights:<p>&#8226; Pharaoh&#8217;s self-interest versus God&#8217;s covenant love.<p>&#8226; Earthly kings&#8217; limits versus the Almighty&#8217;s commitment to His promises (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are wandering the land in confusion</b><p>Pharaoh interprets Israel&#8217;s unusual route as aimless. In reality, &#8220;God did not lead them on the road through the land of the Philistines, although that was shorter&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/13-17.htm">Exodus 13:17</a>); He chose a path that looked erratic to confound Egypt and strengthen Israel&#8217;s faith. Human wisdom often misreads divine strategy&#8212;&#8220;The foolishness of God is wiser than men&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-25.htm">1 Corinthians 1:25</a>). What seemed disorderly was, in fact, the precise setup for the Red Sea miracle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the wilderness has boxed them in</b><p>Geographically, Israel was camped with desert on both flanks, the sea before them, and Egypt behind (<a href="/exodus/14-2.htm">Exodus 14:2</a>).

What Pharaoh viewed as Israel&#8217;s confusion and entrapment was actually God&#8217;s purposeful design to display His power, keep His promises, and deepen His people&#8217;s trust.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Entangled in the land.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">confused, perplexed.</span> (Comp. <a href="/esther/3-15.htm" title="The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace.

Pharaoh, seeing that the Israelites had placed the Bitter Lakes on their left, and were marching southward, in a direction which would soon put the Red Sea on one side of them and a desert region--that about the Jebel Atakah--on the other, thought that they must be quite ignorant of the geography, and have, as it were, "lost their way." He observed, moreover, that "the wilderness had shut them in." The desert tract between the Nile Valley and the Red Sea lay upon their left and in their front: they would soon be unable to proceed, and would not know which way to turn.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They are entangled in the land</span>. Or "they are confused," "perplexed" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>. "they have lost their way." Pharaoh could not conceive that they would have taken the route to the west of the Bitter Lakes, which conducted to no tolerable territory, unless they were hopelessly at sea with respect to the geography of the country. In this "perplexity" of theirs he thought he saw his own opportunity. The wilderness hath shut them in. Pharaoh is thinking of his own "wilderness," the desert country between the Nile valley and the Red Sea. This desert, he says, "blocks their way, and shuts them in " - they cannot escape if he follows in their steps, for they will have the sea on one hand, the desert on the other, and in their front, while he himself presses upon their rear. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/14-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For Pharaoh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will say</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
