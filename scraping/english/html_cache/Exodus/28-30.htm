These objects were used to discern God's will in specific situations, reflecting the importance of divine guidance in Israelite leadership. The exact nature and appearance of the Urim and Thummim are unknown, but they were integral to the priestly garments, symbolizing the need for righteous judgment and decision-making. The breastpiece itself was a sacred garment, richly adorned and signifying the high priest's role as a mediator between God and the people.<p><b>so that they will also be over Aaron&#8217;s heart whenever he comes before the LORD</b><br>The placement of the Urim and Thummim over Aaron's heart emphasizes the connection between the high priest's duties and his inner life. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. By carrying these objects over his heart, Aaron was reminded of the weighty responsibility of seeking God's will with sincerity and integrity. This act symbolizes the need for leaders to carry the concerns of the people with compassion and truthfulness when approaching God.<p><b>Aaron will continually carry the judgment of the sons of Israel over his heart before the LORD</b><br>Aaron, as the high priest, served as an intermediary between God and the Israelites. His role involved not only performing rituals but also representing the people's needs and sins before God. The phrase "carry the judgment" indicates the ongoing responsibility of the high priest to seek divine guidance and justice for the nation. This continual act underscores the perpetual need for atonement and intercession, foreshadowing the ultimate high priest, Jesus Christ, who carries the sins of humanity and intercedes on their behalf. The high priest's role points to the greater priesthood of Christ, who fulfills and perfects the mediation between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

Adding the Urim and Thummim makes the breastpiece a complete instrument for discerning the LORD&#8217;s will.<p>- Scripture records occasions when leaders sought direction through this means (<a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63</a>).

The expression used is identical with that employed in <a href="/exodus/25-15.htm" title="The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.">Exodus 25:15</a>; <a href="/exodus/25-21.htm" title="And you shall put the mercy seat above on the ark; and in the ark you shall put the testimony that I shall give you.">Exodus 25:21</a> with respect to putting the Two Tables into the Ark of the Covenant, and can scarcely have any other meaning than the literal placing of one thing inside another. It has been already shown (see Note on <a href="/exodus/28-16.htm" title="Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.">Exodus 28:16</a>) that the breastplate was a bag, and so capable of being used as a receptacle. The words "Urim and Thummim" mean literally, "lights and perfections," or, if the plural be one of dignity, "light and perfection" (Aquila and Symmachus translate by <span class= "greekheb">???????? ??? ???????????</span>; the LXX., by <span class= "greekheb">? ??????? ??? ? ???????</span>; the Vulg. by doctrina et veritas). The question arises, what do these two words, as here used, designate? Do they designate material objects; if so, what objects? In favour of their designating material objects are (1) the expressions, "thou shalt put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim," "they shall be upon Aaron's heart," "he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim" (<a href="/leviticus/8-8.htm" title="And he put the breastplate on him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.">Leviticus 8:8</a>); (2) the fact that the words are accompanied by the article, on this, the first mention of them, as if they were familiar objects, well known at the time to the people generally; and (3) the explanations of Philo and Josephus, which, while they differ in all other respects, agree in this, that material objects are intended. But, if so, what objects? The two sides of the breastplate, says Philo (<span class= "ital">De Monarch., </span>ii. 5). But these were not "put in" the breastplate after it was complete, as implied in <a href="/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-8.htm" title="And he put the breastplate on him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.">Leviticus 8:8</a>. The twelve jewels, says Josephus; but the present passage, taken in conjunction with <a href="/context/exodus/28-17.htm" title="And you shall set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall be the first row.">Exodus 28:17-21</a>, distinguishes the Urim and Thummim from them. Some small objects which the bag of the breastplate could hold, and with which the people had long been familiar, can alone answer the requirements of the case. Most modern critics are thus far agreed; but when the further question is asked, what were these objects? The greatest difference appears. Diamonds, cut and uncut; slips of metal, marked with "yes" and "no"; lots, of some kind or other; and small images, like the <span class= "ital">teraphim </span>(<a href="/genesis/31-19.htm" title="And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.">Genesis 31:19</a>), are among the suggestions. A very slight examination of the arguments by which these various views are supported is sufficient to show that certainty on the subject is unattainable. Probability, however, seems on the whole to be in favour of a connection between divination by <span class= "ital">teraphim </span>and consultation of God by Urim and Thummim (<a href="/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="/judges/18-14.htm" title="Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said to their brothers, Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.">Judges 18:14</a>; <a href="/judges/18-17.htm" title="And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.">Judges 18:17</a>; <a href="/judges/18-20.htm" title="And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the middle of the people.">Judges 18:20</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>), whence it is reasonable to conclude that the Urim and Thummim were small images, by which God had been consulted in the past, and by which Moses was now authorised to state that He would be consulted in the future. How the consultation was made, and the decision given, is a question still more obscure than that which has been just considered, and one which seems to the present writer to admit of no solution. The reader who is curious upon the point may be referred to Dean Plumptre's article on "Urim and Thummim," in Dr. W. Smith's <span class= "ital">Dictionary of the Bible, </span>where the views propounded are ingenious, if not altogether satisfactory. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Thou shalt put in the breast-plate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim.</span> The words <span class="accented">Urim</span> and <span class="accented">Thummim</span> mean respectively "Lights "and" Perfections," or perhaps "Light" and "Perfection - the plural form being merely a plural of honour.

What exactly the two words represented is doubtful in the extreme. It has been supposed by some that they were not material objects, but a method by which God communicated his will; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, a miraculous light, or a miraculous voice. But such things as these could not have been put by Moses either "in," or "on the breastplate of judgment." Modern critics are generally agreed that the Urim and Thummim must have been material objects of one kind or another. The objects suggested are - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The engraved stones of the breast-plate. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Two small images, like the <span class="accented">teraphim</span>. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A gold plate, engraved with the name of Jehovah.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/28-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And place</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1438;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;a&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
