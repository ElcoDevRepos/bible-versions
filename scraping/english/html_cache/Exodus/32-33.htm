In the context of <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, Moses is interceding for the people after they have sinned by worshiping the golden calf. This interaction underscores the personal relationship Moses had with God, which is further emphasized in passages like <a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>, where it is said that the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend.<p><b>Whoever has sinned against Me</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the personal nature of sin as an offense against God Himself. In the context of the golden calf incident, the Israelites' sin was not just idolatry but a breach of the covenant relationship with God. This concept of sin as a personal affront to God is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>, where David acknowledges his sin against God alone. It also reflects the biblical principle that each individual is accountable for their own sin, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>.<p><b>I will blot out of My book</b><br>The "book" mentioned here is often understood as the Book of Life, a metaphorical record of those who belong to God. This concept appears in other parts of the Bible, such as <a href="/psalms/69-28.htm">Psalm 69:28</a> and <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>, where being blotted out signifies exclusion from God's people and eternal life. The idea of a divine ledger underscores the seriousness of sin and the consequences of turning away from God. It also points to the ultimate judgment, where only those who are righteous through faith will remain in the book, a theme that finds fulfillment in the New Testament through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is holy and just, and who communicates directly with Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, interceding on behalf of the people after they sinned by worshiping the golden calf.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who have sinned by creating and worshiping a golden calf while Moses was on Mount Sinai.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the Ten Commandments and where this dialogue between God and Moses occurs.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_book_of_life.htm">The Book of Life</a></b><br>A metaphorical book mentioned by God, representing those who are righteous and have eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not a trivial matter; it has serious consequences, including separation from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_mercy.htm">God&#8217;s Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>God is just and must punish sin, but He is also merciful, as seen in His willingness to listen to Moses&#8217; intercession.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercessory_prayer.htm">Intercessory Prayer</a></b><br>Moses&#8217; role as an intercessor highlights the power and importance of praying for others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_book_of_life.htm">The Book of Life</a></b><br>This concept reminds believers of the eternal perspective and the importance of living a life that honors God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_forgiveness.htm">Repentance and Forgiveness</a></b><br>While sin is serious, God offers forgiveness to those who repent and turn back to Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_32_33_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 32:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_32_33_Personal_sin_responsibility.htm">How does Exodus 32:33 emphasize personal responsibility for sin before God?

Now the Lord answers. His response reminds us that:<p>- God remains personally involved with His mediator. The same God who &#8220;spoke to Moses face to face&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>) is now issuing a solemn verdict.<p>- Divine patience is real, but not limitless. Though He &#8220;relented of the disaster&#8221; (32:14), He still addresses guilt, echoing later statements such as <a href="/numbers/14-20.htm">Numbers 14:20-23</a> and <a href="/psalms/99-6.htm">Psalm 99:6-8</a>.<p>- The personal dialog underscores God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness. Just as He listened to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>, He listens here; yet His justice stands firm (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whoever has sinned against Me</b><p>The focus shifts from national to individual accountability.<p>- Sin is first and foremost against God Himself, as David later confesses, &#8220;Against You, You only, have I sinned&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>).<p>- Each person bears responsibility. <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a> declares, &#8220;Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children for their fathers,&#8221; a theme echoed in <a href="/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4, 20</a>.<p>- The statement exposes the universal need for atonement. <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>&#8212;&#8220;all have sinned&#8221;&#8212;and <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a> trace sin&#8217;s root and consequence. Yet grace is offered: <a href="/numbers/15-25.htm">Numbers 15:25</a> shows sacrifices covering unintentional sin, foreshadowing the perfect sacrifice of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will blot out of My book</b><p>Here God introduces the sobering image of a heavenly registry.<p>- Scripture repeatedly refers to a divine book: Moses mentions it again in <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>; later writers speak of it as &#8220;the book of the living&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/69-28.htm">Psalm 69:28</a>), &#8220;the book&#8221; that ensures deliverance (<a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>), and &#8220;the Book of Life&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>; 20:12).<p>- Blotting out is literal and judicial. Just as ancient scribes could erase a name from civic rolls, God can remove the unrepentant from His record, a warning echoed in <a href="/revelation/22-19.htm">Revelation 22:19</a>.<p>- Yet assurance shines through: <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a> promises the overcomer, &#8220;I will never blot out his name,&#8221; and <a href="/luke/10-20.htm">Luke 10:20</a> urges believers to rejoice that their names &#8220;are written in heaven.&#8221; Those who trust God&#8217;s provision&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Christ&#8212;find security rather than erasure (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/32-33.htm">Exodus 32:33</a> balances mercy and justice. God hears Moses&#8217; plea, but He will still hold each sinner personally accountable, even to the point of erasing a name from His heavenly book. The verse warns against presuming on grace while offering hope: repentance and faith secure a permanent place in that book, a promise later sealed by the atoning work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out.</span>--Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/18-4.htm" title="Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sins, it shall die.">Ezekiel 18:4</a> : "The soul that sinneth, it shall die." A mere man cannot take other men's sins on him, cannot relieve them of the penalties attached to sin, the worst of which is the depravation of the soul itself. Sin persisted in blots out from God's book by the absolute contradiction that there is between evil and good. Even Christ's merits cannot avail the sinner who does not put away his sin, detest it, abhor, it, revolt from it. Only One who can implant a principle of life in man can save from death.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book</span>. Beyond a doubt, it is the general teaching of Scripture that vicarious punishment will not be accepted. "The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son - the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him" (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>). Man "cannot deliver his brother, or make agreement with God for him; for it cost more to redeem their souls, so that he must let that alone for ever "(<a href="/psalms/49-7.htm">Psalm 49:7, 8</a>). One only atonement is accepted - that of him who is at once man and God - who has, himself, no sin - and can therefore lake the punishment of others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/32-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
