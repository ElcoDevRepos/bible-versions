Throughout the Pentateuch, God frequently speaks to Moses, establishing him as a central prophetic figure. This communication underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, with Moses as the mediator.<p><b>Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh</b><br>God promises imminent action against Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt. This statement sets the stage for the forthcoming plagues, which serve as divine judgments against Egypt's oppression of the Israelites. The phrase highlights God's sovereignty and power over earthly rulers, a recurring theme in the Bible. It also foreshadows the dramatic events that will lead to the Exodus, a pivotal moment in Israel's history.<p><b>for because of My mighty hand he will let the people go</b><br>The "mighty hand" symbolizes God's power and intervention. This imagery is often used in the Old Testament to describe God's deliverance and protection of His people. The phrase assures Moses that Pharaoh's eventual decision to release the Israelites will be a direct result of God's intervention, not Pharaoh's benevolence. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's deliverance and faithfulness to His promises.<p><b>because of My strong hand he will drive them out of his land</b><br>The repetition of "strong hand" emphasizes the certainty and force of God's actions. This phrase suggests that not only will Pharaoh allow the Israelites to leave, but he will also compel them to do so, highlighting the overwhelming nature of God's power. This anticipates the urgency and decisiveness of the Exodus, where Pharaoh's resistance is ultimately broken. Theologically, it points to God's ability to fulfill His promises despite human opposition, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who reveals His power and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The chosen leader and prophet of Israel, tasked with delivering the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, representing opposition to God's will and the enslavement of the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved, symbolizing oppression and the need for divine intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The event of Israel's deliverance from Egypt, showcasing God's power and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>God is in control of all events and rulers, and His purposes will be accomplished despite human resistance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Like Moses, believers are called to trust in God's promises, even when circumstances seem insurmountable.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/deliverance_and_redemption.htm">Deliverance and Redemption</a></b><br>The Exodus is a foreshadowing of the ultimate deliverance through Christ, reminding us of God's redemptive plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_timing.htm">God's Timing</a></b><br>God's timing is perfect, and His deliverance often comes after a period of waiting and preparation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_obedience.htm">The Role of Obedience</a></b><br>Moses' obedience to God's command is crucial, highlighting the importance of following God's direction in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_6_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 6:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_6_1_God_s_power_in_deliverance.htm">How does Exodus 6:1 reveal God's power in delivering His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_strong_hand_in_Exodus_6_1.htm">What does "strong hand" in Exodus 6:1 teach about God's intervention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_timing_in_Exodus_6_1.htm">How can we trust God's timing as seen in Exodus 6:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Exodus_6_1_to_Genesis_promises.htm">Connect Exodus 6:1 to God's promises in Genesis regarding Israel's deliverance.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_6_1_s_impact_on_faith_in_trials.htm">How should Exodus 6:1 influence our faith during personal trials?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_6_1_God_s_power_over_Pharaoh.htm">How does Exodus 6:1 demonstrate God's power over Pharaoh?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_act_with_a_mighty_hand_in_Exodus_6_1.htm">Why did God choose to act with a "mighty hand" in Exodus 6:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_6_1_God_s_timing_for_deliverance.htm">What does Exodus 6:1 reveal about God's timing in delivering the Israelites?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/benefits_of_studying_theology.htm">Why did God kill Egypt's firstborn children?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/evidence_of_moses_confronting_pharaoh.htm">Exodus 5:1: Where is the historical or archaeological evidence of Moses confronting an Egyptian Pharaoh as described?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/exodus_2_2_-_how_was_moses_hidden.htm">Exodus 2:2 -
