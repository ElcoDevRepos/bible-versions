It served as the dwelling place of God among His people. The Hebrew word for tabernacle, "mishkan," means "dwelling place." This command emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's instructions, as the tabernacle was to be constructed precisely as God directed. The tabernacle prefigures Jesus Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), symbolizing God's presence with humanity.<p><b>and design all its furnishings</b><br>The furnishings of the tabernacle included the Ark of the Covenant, the table for the showbread, the golden lampstand, the altar of incense, and other items. Each piece had specific symbolic meanings and functions, pointing to aspects of worship and the nature of God. For example, the Ark represented God's throne and His covenant with Israel, while the lampstand symbolized the light of God's presence. These furnishings also foreshadowed Christ's work and His role as the light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><b>according to the pattern I show you.</b><br>The pattern given to Moses was a divine blueprint, indicating that the tabernacle was a copy of heavenly realities (<a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>). This underscores the idea that earthly worship is a reflection of heavenly worship. The specificity of the pattern highlights the holiness and orderliness of God, requiring precise adherence to His instructions. This pattern also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>) and the mediator of a new covenant, bringing believers into the heavenly sanctuary (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to receive the Law, including the instructions for the tabernacle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>A portable sanctuary that served as the dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the instructions for the tabernacle and the Law from God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were to construct the tabernacle according to the divine pattern given to Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence.htm">God's Presence</a></b><br>The central focus of the tabernacle, symbolizing God's desire to dwell among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_blueprint.htm">Divine Blueprint</a></b><br>God provides specific instructions for His dwelling place, emphasizing the importance of obedience and reverence in worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_tabernacle.htm">Symbolism of the Tabernacle</a></b><br>Each element of the tabernacle points to deeper spiritual truths and foreshadows Christ's work and presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_desire_to_dwell_with_us.htm">God's Desire to Dwell with Us</a></b><br>The tabernacle represents God's ongoing desire to be present with His people, culminating in Jesus and the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/attention_to_detail_in_worship.htm">Attention to Detail in Worship</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were to follow God's pattern precisely, we are called to approach worship with intentionality and respect.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_following_god's_plan.htm">Faithfulness in Following God's Plan</a></b><br>The construction of the tabernacle teaches us the importance of adhering to God's guidance in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_25_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 25:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_25_9_Follow_God_s_details.htm">How does Exodus 25:9 emphasize following God's specific instructions in our lives?

Many of the old Jewish commentators supposed, that Moses was shown by God a real material structure, which actually existed in the heavens, far grander than its earthly copy, after which he was to have the tabernacle fashioned. Some recent Christian writers, without going these lengths, suggest that "an actual picture or model of the earthly tabernacle and its furniture was shown to him" (Keil). But the words of the text, as well as those of <a href="/acts/7-44.htm">Acts 7:44</a>, and <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>, are sufficiently justified, if we take a view less material than either of these - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, if we suppose Moses to have had impressed on his mind, in vision, the exact appearance of the tabernacle and its adjuncts, in such sort that he could both fully understand, and also, when necessary, supplement, the verbal descriptions subsequently given to him. It is unnecessary to inquire how the impression was produced. God who in vision communicated to Ezekiel the entire plan of that magnificent temple which he describes in ch. 40-42, could certainly have made known to Moses, in the same way, the far simpler structure of the primitive Tabernacle. <p> CHAPTER 25:10-22 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/25-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You must make</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the tabernacle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mi&#353;&#183;k&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
