Blue often represents the heavens, divinity, and the Holy Spirit. In the context of the tabernacle and priestly garments, blue signifies the heavenly origin and nature of the priesthood. The color blue was also a reminder of the commandments, as seen in <a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-39</a>, where the Israelites were instructed to wear tassels with a blue cord to remember God's laws. The robe being entirely blue emphasizes the purity and heavenly calling of the high priest.<p><b>the work of a weaver</b><br>The phrase "the work of a weaver" indicates the skill and craftsmanship involved in creating the robe. Weaving was a respected and essential craft in ancient times, requiring precision and expertise. This detail highlights the care and dedication required in preparing items for worship and service to God.
