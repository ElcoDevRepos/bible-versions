The imagery of God's nostrils suggests a powerful, divine breath that controls nature. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> where God speaks the world into existence. The "blast" signifies a sudden and forceful action, reminiscent of the breath of life given to Adam (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>) and the breath of God in <a href="/ezekiel/37-9.htm">Ezekiel 37:9-10</a> that brings life to dry bones.<p><b>the waters piled up;</b><br>This refers to the miraculous parting of the Red Sea, a pivotal event in Israel's history. The piling up of waters signifies God's intervention and deliverance of His people from Egyptian bondage. This event is a type of baptism, as noted in <a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>, symbolizing the transition from slavery to freedom. The piling up of waters also echoes the creation narrative where God separates waters to create dry land (<a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9-10</a>), highlighting His control over chaos.<p><b>like a wall the currents stood firm;</b><br>The imagery of waters standing like a wall emphasizes the miraculous nature of the event. In ancient Near Eastern culture, water often symbolized chaos and danger. God's ability to make the waters stand firm demonstrates His power to bring order and safety. This is paralleled in <a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13-16</a>, where the Jordan River's waters are stopped, allowing the Israelites to cross into the Promised Land. The firm standing of the waters also prefigures Christ's calming of the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>, showcasing divine authority over nature.<p><b>the depths congealed in the heart of the sea.</b><br>The term "congealed" suggests a solidification or freezing, indicating a supernatural act. The "depths" refer to the deep waters of the sea, often associated with the unknown and fearsome. In biblical symbolism, the sea represents chaos and evil, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a> where the absence of the sea signifies the removal of chaos in the new creation. The congealing of the depths highlights God's ability to transform chaos into a pathway for His people, foreshadowing the ultimate victory over evil through Christ's resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who led them out of Egyptian bondage.

Scripture often portrays the Lord&#8217;s breath or wind as a decisive force:<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a> &#8211; &#8220;God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters receded,&#8221; reminding us that one breath can reorder creation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a> &#8211; &#8220;By His breath the skies were cleared,&#8221; showing divine power expressed through something as simple as wind.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/22-16.htm">2 Samuel 22:16</a> &#8211; &#8220;The channels of the sea appeared&#8230; at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils,&#8221; a parallel description of waters fleeing before Him.<p>The phrase invites us to see the Red Sea miracle as a direct, personal act of God, not a chance occurrence.

Poetically, Moses describes the east wind which God set in motion as "the blast" or "breath of his nostrils." By means of it, he says, the waters were "gathered together," or "piled up;" then, growing bolder in his imagery, he represents the floods as "standing in a heap" on either side, and the depths as "congealed. No doubt, if these terms are meant to be taken literally, the miracle must have been one in which "the sea" (as Kalisch says) "giving up its nature, formed with its waves a firm wall, and instead of streaming like a fluid, congealed into a hard substance." But the question is, are we justified in taking literally the strong expressions of a highly wrought poetical description? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/15-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At the blast</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
