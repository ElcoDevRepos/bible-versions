Her compassion towards the Hebrew child reflects God's providence and intervention. This act of kindness by an Egyptian royal contrasts with Pharaoh's decree to kill Hebrew male infants, highlighting divine orchestration in Moses' survival.<p><b>Take this child and nurse him for me</b><br>This command signifies a turning point in Moses' early life. The act of nursing by his biological mother, Jochebed, allows Moses to be raised with Hebrew identity and values during his formative years. This arrangement also fulfills God's plan for Moses to be prepared for his future role as a leader of Israel. The cultural practice of wet-nursing was common in ancient times, and it was not unusual for children to be nursed by someone other than their biological mother.<p><b>and I will pay your wages</b><br>The offer of wages to Jochebed for nursing her own son is an example of God's provision and blessing. It underscores the theme of divine justice and reward, as Jochebed is compensated for her faith and courage in saving Moses. This arrangement also reflects the economic practices of the time, where wet-nurses were often hired and compensated for their services.<p><b>So the woman took the boy and nursed him</b><br>Jochebed's acceptance of the task to nurse Moses ensures that he is nurtured in the Hebrew faith and culture. This period of nursing, which could last several years, was crucial for Moses' identity formation. The act of nursing symbolizes care, protection, and the transmission of cultural and spiritual values. This phase in Moses' life is foundational for his later role as the deliverer of Israel, drawing a parallel to how Jesus was nurtured in a humble setting before His public ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh's_daughter.htm">Pharaoh's Daughter</a></b><br>The Egyptian princess who discovers Moses in the Nile and decides to adopt him, showing compassion and defying her father's decree.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses'_mother.htm">Moses' Mother (Jochebed)</a></b><br>The Hebrew woman who is Moses' biological mother.
