It reflects the ongoing dialogue between God and His chosen leader, a theme prevalent throughout the Pentateuch. This divine instruction follows the incident of the golden calf (Exodus 32), where Moses interceded for Israel, showcasing his role as mediator, a type of Christ who intercedes for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>Chisel out two stone tablets like the originals</b><br>The command to chisel new tablets signifies a renewal of the covenant after Israel's breach. The original tablets, written by the finger of God (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>), were broken by Moses in righteous anger (<a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>). The act of chiseling represents human participation in divine work, paralleling the New Covenant where believers are called to actively engage in their faith (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12-13</a>). The tablets symbolize the permanence and unchanging nature of God's law.<p><b>and I will write on them the words</b><br>God's promise to inscribe the words Himself underscores His authority and the divine origin of the law. This act signifies that the law is not merely human tradition but a divine mandate. It also foreshadows the New Covenant, where God's laws are written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>), indicating an internal transformation rather than external adherence.<p><b>that were on the first tablets</b><br>The reference to the first tablets highlights continuity and restoration. Despite Israel's sin, God's covenant remains steadfast. This continuity is crucial for understanding the faithfulness of God, who does not abandon His promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). It also points to the consistency of God's moral standards, which are fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>which you broke</b><br>This phrase recalls Moses' reaction to Israel's idolatry, symbolizing the broken relationship between God and His people due to sin. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the need for repentance and restoration.

Moses had asked for the return of God's favour, but had said nothing of these conditions. It is God who insists on them. "Hew thee two tables." The moral law must be delivered afresh--delivered in its completeness--exactly as at the first (<a href="/exodus/34-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Hew you two tables of stone like to the first: and I will write on these tables the words that were in the first tables, which you brake.">Exodus 34:1</a>), and even the ceremonial law must be reimposed in its main items (<a href="/context/exodus/34-12.htm" title="Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you go, lest it be for a snare in the middle of you:">Exodus 34:12-26</a>), or no return to favour is possible. Hence Moses is summoned once more to the top of Sinai, where the Law is to be delivered afresh to him, and is ordered to bring with him tables of stone like the former ones, to receive their written contents from God's hand.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Hew thee two tables</span>.--Something is always lost by sin, even when it is forgiven. The first tables were "the work of God" (<a href="/exodus/32-16.htm" title="And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven on the tables.">Exodus 32:16</a>). the second were hewn by the hand of Moses.<p><span class= "bld">Of stone</span>.--Literally, <span class= "ital">of stones</span>--hewn, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>out of two separate stones, which could not be said of the first tables, since none knew how God had fashioned them.<p><span class= "bld">I will write.</span>--It is quite clear, though some have maintained the contrary, that the second tables, equally with the first, were inscribed "with the finger of God."
