Onyx is a precious stone, often associated with strength and beauty, and its use here signifies the importance of the priestly role. Gold filigree settings highlight the craftsmanship and value, reflecting the divine nature of the priestly duties. Gold, a symbol of purity and divinity, was used extensively in the tabernacle and its furnishings, indicating the sacredness of the objects and the presence of God. The use of gold and precious stones in the priestly garments underscores the connection between the earthly priesthood and the heavenly realities.<p><b>engraved like a seal</b><br>Engraving the stones like a seal suggests permanence and authority. Seals in ancient times were used to authenticate documents and signify ownership or identity. This imagery conveys the idea that the High Priest, bearing these stones, represents the people of Israel before God. The engraving process itself required skill and precision, indicating the care and dedication involved in creating items for worship. This also points to the enduring covenant between God and Israel, as the names were permanently inscribed, symbolizing God's unchanging promises.<p><b>with the names of the sons of Israel</b><br>The names of the sons of Israel refer to the twelve tribes, each represented by a name on the stones. This inclusion signifies the collective identity and unity of the nation before God. The High Priest, by wearing these stones, carried the tribes into the presence of God, interceding on their behalf. This act foreshadows the mediatory role of Jesus Christ, who intercedes for believers before God. The representation of the tribes on the High Priest's garments emphasizes the importance of community and the shared heritage of the people of Israel. It also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness to His promises to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the continuity of His covenant with their descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/onyx_stones.htm">Onyx Stones</a></b><br>Precious stones used in the priestly garments, specifically for the ephod, representing the tribes of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gold_filigree_settings.htm">Gold Filigree Settings</a></b><br>Intricate gold work used to mount the onyx stones, signifying the value and importance of the stones.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_israel.htm">Sons of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the twelve tribes of Israel, each represented by a name engraved on the stones.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gem_cutter.htm">Gem Cutter</a></b><br>The artisan responsible for engraving the names on the stones, highlighting the skill and precision required.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephod.htm">Ephod</a></b><br>A sacred vestment worn by the high priest, symbolizing his role as a mediator between God and the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_onyx_stones.htm">Symbolism of the Onyx Stones</a></b><br>The onyx stones symbolize the importance of each tribe in God's plan.
