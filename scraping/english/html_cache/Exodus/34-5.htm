The cloud is a recurring symbol of God's presence and glory, as seen in the pillar of cloud that guided the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). It represents God's holiness and mystery, often concealing His full glory from human eyes. The descent of the LORD in a cloud also echoes the theophany at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>), where God revealed Himself to Moses and the Israelites. This imagery is further connected to the New Testament, where a cloud envelops Jesus during the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>), symbolizing divine approval and presence.<p><b>stood with him there</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the personal and intimate nature of God's relationship with Moses. Unlike other instances where God speaks from a distance, here He stands with Moses, indicating a special level of communion and favor. This moment is a continuation of the unique relationship Moses has with God, as described in <a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>, where it is said that the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. The standing posture also suggests readiness and authority, as God prepares to reveal His character and covenant to Moses.<p><b>and proclaimed His name, the LORD</b><br>Proclaiming His name signifies a revelation of God's character and essence. In Hebrew culture, a name is deeply connected to one's identity and attributes. The name "the LORD" (YHWH) is the covenant name of God, first revealed to Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>). It conveys God's eternal, self-existent nature and His faithfulness to His promises. This proclamation is a profound moment where God declares His attributes, such as mercy, grace, and justice, which are further detailed in the following verses (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). This revelation is foundational for understanding God's nature and is echoed throughout Scripture, including in the Psalms and the prophets, where God's name is synonymous with His power and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness.

Combined with this promise were two minor ones--that God would make His "goodness" pass before him, and that He would reveal to him afresh His name. The revelation of the name is recorded in <a href="/context/exodus/34-6.htm" title="And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, the manifestation of the glory in <a href="/exodus/34-5.htm" title="And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.">Exodus 34:5</a>.

This section coheres closely with the last section of the preceding chapter, and must be regarded, as the historical account of how God fulfilled the promises there made by him to Moses (<a href="/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19-23</a>). The promises were mainly two - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That he would proclaim his name to him afresh; and <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he would pass by him, and let him see, after he had passed, what man might see of his glory. The fulfilment of the first promise appears in the long enumeration of attributes contained in vers. 6, 7; the fulfilment of the second is expressed with extreme brevity in the words - ,' And the Lord passed by before him" (ver. 6). Probably no further description could be given of that marvellous manifestation beyond those words in which it was promised (<a href="/exodus/33-21.htm">Exodus 33:21-23</a>). Its effects were seen in that permanent reflection of God's glory on the face of Moses, which thenceforth compelled him to wear a veil mostly when he showed himself to the people (vers. 33-35). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord descended in the cloud</span>.
