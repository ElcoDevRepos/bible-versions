Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, represents the oppressive force from which the Israelites are fleeing. His approach signifies a direct threat to their newfound freedom. Historically, Pharaoh's pursuit underscores the relentless nature of the Egyptian regime, unwilling to release the Israelites despite the plagues. This moment is a test of faith for the Israelites, as they face the might of Egypt once more.<p><b>the Israelites looked up</b><br>The act of looking up can symbolize awareness and realization. In this context, it indicates the Israelites' recognition of their dire situation. Geographically, they are trapped between the Red Sea and the approaching Egyptian army, highlighting their vulnerability. This moment of looking up is both literal and metaphorical, as they are forced to confront their fears and the reality of their circumstances.<p><b>and saw the Egyptians marching after them</b><br>The sight of the Egyptians marching signifies imminent danger. The Egyptian army, known for its strength and chariots, represents a formidable force. This phrase emphasizes the Israelites' precarious position, caught between a natural barrier and a powerful military. The historical context of Egyptian military prowess adds to the tension, as the Israelites, former slaves, are ill-equipped to face such an adversary.<p><b>and they were terrified</b><br>Fear is a natural human response to danger, and the Israelites' terror reflects their lack of faith and trust in God's deliverance. This fear contrasts with the faith they are called to have, as seen in previous assurances of God's protection. Theologically, this moment highlights the struggle between faith and fear, a recurring theme throughout the Bible.<p><b>and cried out to the LORD</b><br>In their fear, the Israelites turn to God, demonstrating a reliance on divine intervention. This cry is both a plea for help and an acknowledgment of their dependence on God. It reflects a pattern seen throughout scripture, where God's people call upon Him in times of distress. This act of crying out is a precursor to God's miraculous intervention, foreshadowing the parting of the Red Sea and the ultimate deliverance of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who had enslaved the Israelites and was now pursuing them after initially letting them go.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, who were enslaved in Egypt and are now fleeing towards the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptians.htm">The Egyptians</a></b><br>The army of Pharaoh, pursuing the Israelites to bring them back into slavery.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who had promised to deliver His people from slavery in Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The body of water the Israelites were camped by, which they would miraculously cross.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_deliverance.htm">Trust in God's Deliverance</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were terrified but cried out to the LORD, we should turn to God in our moments of fear and uncertainty, trusting in His power to deliver us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_fear.htm">The Reality of Fear</a></b><br>Acknowledge that fear is a natural human response, but it should drive us to seek God rather than paralyze us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Remember that God is faithful to His promises.

The entire armed force of Egypt is reckoned by Herodotus (2:166-168) at 410,000, and it is tolerably clear that not one-half of these could have been mustered. It would imply, indeed, more facility of mobilisation than we should have expected in this early age, if Pharaoh was able to bring 100,000 men into the field upon a sudden emergency. Why, then, it is asked, should the Israelites have been "sore afraid" of a force but one-sixth of their number? Were they "arrant cowards?" The answer is that the Egyptian army, whatever its number, was composed of trained soldiers, well-armed and used to war; the 600,000 Israelites were, in the main, unarmed, ignorant of warfare, and trained very imperfectly. Above a million Persian <span class= "ital">soldiers</span> were defeated and slaughtered like sheep by 47,000 Graeco-Macedonians at Arbela. A similar result would, humanly speaking, have followed on a conflict between the Israelites and the Egyptians at Pi-hahiroth. The fear of the former was therefore perfectly legitimate.<p><span class= "bld">The children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.</span>--If Israel had been unduly timid--which we have shown not to have been the case--at any rate they knew where to make their appeal for succour. There is no help like that of Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-14.</span> - THE TERROR OF ISRAEL AND THE COURAGE OF MOSES. It has been argued that the Israelites, if they were so numerous as stated (<a href="/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>), must have been wretched cowards, if they were afraid to risk an engagement with such an army as that hastily levied one which Pharaoh had brought with him. But the difference between an army of trained soldiers, thoroughly equipped for war, with helmets, shields, breastplates, swords and spears, and an undisciplined multitude, unarmed for the most part, and wholly unaccustomed to warfare, is such, that the latter, whatever its numbers, may be excused if it does not feel able to cope with the former, and declines an engagement. Numbers, without military training and discipline, are of no avail - nay, are even a disadvantage, since the men impede one another. It is not necessary to suppose that the Israelites were debased in character by their long servitude to account for their panic on seeing the army of Pharaoh. They had good grounds for their fear. Humanly speaking, resistance would simply have led to their indiscriminate massacre. The alarm of the Hebrews, and even the reproaches with which they assail Moses, are thus quite natural under the circumstances. What is surprising is, the noble courage and confidence of Moses. Moses, though only vaguely informed, that God would "be honoured upon Pharaoh and all his host" (ver. 4), is perfectly certain that all will go well - how the result will be achieved, he knows not; but he is sure that Israel will be delivered and Egypt discomfited; his people have no reason to fear - they have but to "stand still and see the salvation of God" (ver. 13); "the Lord will fight for them;" they will have simply to "hold their peace" (ver. 14). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They were sore afraid</span>. Before the Israelites are taxed with cowardice, let it be considered - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That they were unarmed. Egypt was so settled a government that civilians generally went unarmed; and slaves, like the Hebrews, would scarcely have been allowed to possess any arms, if the case had been otherwise. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> They had no military training. Whatever had been done to teach them order and arrangement in connection with their proposed journey, we may be sure there had been no drill or training in the use of arms, since this would have been regarded by the Egyptians as open rebellion. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> They were quite unaccustomed to warfare. The Pharaohs main-rained large garrisons of Egyptian and mercenary troops in the frontier provinces, to resist the invasions to which they were liable. The Hebrews may have had occasionally to defend themselves against a hasty raid: but in real war they had stood aloof, and left the fighting to the regular Egyptian army. <span class="cmt_word">The children of Israel cried out unto the Lord</span>. The appeal to Jehovah showed that, with all their weaknesses and imperfections, the Israelites were yet true at heart. They knew where alone help was to be obtained, and made their appeal accordingly.
