In ancient Israel, property was often a family's livelihood, and theft was a serious offense. The context here is a nighttime intrusion, as indicated by the surrounding verses, which implies a greater threat to personal safety. The law reflects the need to protect one's home and family, a principle that resonates with the broader biblical theme of justice and protection of the innocent.<p><b>and is beaten to death</b><br>The phrase suggests a defensive action taken by the homeowner. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, homes were often simple structures, making it easier for intruders to enter. The law acknowledges the potential for violent confrontation when a homeowner defends their property. This reflects the broader biblical principle of self-defense, which is seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/nehemiah/4-14.htm">Nehemiah 4:14</a>, where the people are encouraged to defend their families.<p><b>no one shall be guilty of bloodshed</b><br>This part of the verse provides legal protection for the homeowner, indicating that the act of killing the thief in this context is not considered murder. The law distinguishes between premeditated murder and killing in self-defense. This distinction is important in the biblical legal system, as seen in <a href="/numbers/35-22.htm">Numbers 35:22-25</a>, where cities of refuge are established for those who kill unintentionally. The principle here underscores the value of life and the importance of intent in determining guilt.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/thief.htm">Thief</a></b><br>The individual attempting to unlawfully enter a property, representing a threat to personal and property security.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/homeowner.htm">Homeowner</a></b><br>The person defending their home, whose actions are under scrutiny in the context of self-defense.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation receiving these laws as part of the Mosaic Law, which governed their civil and moral conduct.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mosaic_law.htm">Mosaic Law</a></b><br>The legal and moral code given to the Israelites through Moses, which includes laws on property and personal rights.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate lawgiver, whose justice and righteousness are reflected in the laws given to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_context.htm">Understanding Context</a></b><br>Recognize that this law was given in a specific cultural and historical context, where personal property and family safety were paramount.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_self-defense.htm">Principle of Self-Defense</a></b><br>The passage highlights the principle of self-defense, acknowledging the right to protect one's home and family.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_life.htm">Value of Life</a></b><br>While the law permits defense, it also implicitly values life by distinguishing between day and night, suggesting a measured response.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/moral_responsibility.htm">Moral Responsibility</a></b><br>Even in self-defense, there is a moral responsibility to consider the value of human life and the potential for non-lethal outcomes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/modern_application.htm">Modern Application</a></b><br>Consider how this principle applies today in terms of personal safety, legal rights, and moral responsibilities in protecting oneself and others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Exodus_22_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Exodus 22:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_2_on_biblical_self-defense.htm">How does Exodus 22:2 address self-defense in a biblical context?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_2_on_home_defense.htm">What does Exodus 22:2 reveal about God's view on protecting one's home?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_2_vs_Jesus_non-violence.htm">How can Exodus 22:2 be reconciled with Jesus' teachings on non-violence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_2_Modern_Christian_application.htm">How should Christians apply Exodus 22:2 in modern-day legal and ethical situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Exodus_22_2_Justice_vs_Mercy_Principles.htm">What principles from Exodus 22:2 guide us in balancing justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Is_Exodus_22_2_a_blanket_self-defense_rule.htm">Does Exodus 22:2 justify self-defense in all situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Ex_22_2_align_with_Do_not_kill.htm">How does Exodus 22:2 align with the commandment "Thou shalt not kill"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Exodus_22_laws.htm">What historical context influenced the laws in Exodus 22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_exodus_22.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Exodus 22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_self-defense.htm">What does the Bible say about self-defense?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_rest's_importance_in_the_bible.htm">Is it right to take another person's life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_the_bible_say_'kill'_or_'murder'.htm">Does the Bible say "kill" or "murder"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_allow_more_killing_in_esther_9_13-15.htm">Esther 9:13&#8211;15: Why would an additional day of killing be sanctioned, and does this align with other biblical teachings on mercy and restraint?

Lethal force is not commanded, yet it is deemed justifiable when the threat is immediate and unavoidable, demonstrating God&#8217;s just balance of mercy toward the innocent and accountability for the evildoer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">If a thief be found breaking up.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">breaking in: i.e., </span>making forcible entry into a dwelling-house. Most codes agree with the Mosaic in allowing the inmates of the house to resist such an attempt if made at night, and to shed the blood of the burglar, if necessary. He may be considered as having dissolved the "social compact," and converted himself from a fellow-citizen into a public enemy. A murderous intent on his part may be suspected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a thief be found breaking up</span>. Rather, "Breaking in" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, making forcible entry into a house. The ordinary mode of "breaking in" seems to have been by a breach in the wall. Hence the word here used, which is derived from <span class="accented">khathar</span>, "to dig." <span class="cmt_word">There shall no blood be shed for him</span>. Rather, "the blood-feud shall not lie upon him" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the avenger of blood shall not be entitled to proceed against his slayer. The principle here laid down has had the sanction of Solon, of the Roman law, and of the law of England. It rests upon the probability that those who break into a house by night bare a murderous intent, or at least have the design, if occasion arise, to commit murder. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/22-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a thief</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;gan&#183;n&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1590.htm">Strong's 1590: </a> </span><span class="str2">A stealer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is caught</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1461;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(yim&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4672.htm">Strong's 4672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come forth to, appear, exist, to attain, find, acquire, to occur, meet, be present</span><br /><br /><span class="word">breaking in</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1435;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(bam&#183;ma&#7717;&#183;te&#183;re&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4290.htm">Strong's 4290: </a> </span><span class="str2">A burglary, unexpected examination</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and is beaten</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;huk&#183;k&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hofal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5221.htm">Strong's 5221: </a> </span><span class="str2">To strike</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to death,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1425;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;m&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><br /><span class="word">no one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">shall be guilty of bloodshed.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1818.htm">Strong's 1818: </a> </span><span class="str2">Blood, of man, an animal, the juice of the grape, bloodshed</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/22-2.htm">OT Law: Exodus 22:2 If the thief is found breaking (Exo.
