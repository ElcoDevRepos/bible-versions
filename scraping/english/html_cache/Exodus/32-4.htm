The gold likely came from the spoils of Egypt, as the Israelites had been instructed to ask the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold before their departure (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>). This act of collecting gold highlights the people's willingness to contribute to idolatry, contrasting with their later contributions to the construction of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21-22</a>).<p><b>and with an engraving tool he fashioned it into a molten calf</b><br>The use of an engraving tool indicates a deliberate and skilled act of craftsmanship, suggesting Aaron's complicity in the creation of the idol. The molten calf is significant as it reflects the influence of Egyptian culture, where the bull was a symbol of strength and fertility, often associated with the god Apis. This act of idolatry directly violated the first two commandments given by God (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>).<p><b>And they said, &#8220;These, O Israel, are your gods</b><br>This declaration by the Israelites reveals their spiritual infidelity and misunderstanding of God's nature. The plural "gods" may reflect a syncretistic attempt to merge their worship of Yahweh with pagan practices. This statement echoes the temptation to attribute divine power to created objects, a recurring theme in Israel's history (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>).<p><b>who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a direct affront to God's deliverance of Israel from slavery, as it attributes His mighty acts to a man-made idol.

The verse warns that blessings can become snares, leadership carries grave responsibility, and misdirected worship quickly rewrites truth. Only steadfast allegiance to the Lord who truly &#8220;brought you up out of the land of Egypt&#8221; keeps hearts from forging modern calves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">and he received it </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the gold) <span class= "ital">at their hand, and bound it in a bag. </span>So Gesenius, Rosenmller, Frst, Knobel, Kurtz, Maurer, Ser&#8221;der, Cook, &c. "Fashioned it with a graving tool" is a possible rendering of the Hebrew words, but will not suit here, since the next clause tells us that the image was a molten one, and if it had been intended to say that the image was first molten and then finished with a graving too!, the order of the two clauses would have been inverted. A similar phrase to that here used has the sense of "bound in a bag" in <a href="/2_kings/5-23.htm" title="And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them on two of his servants; and they bore them before him.">2Kings 5:23</a>.<p><span class= "bld">After he had made it a molten calf.</span>--This is a quite impossible rendering. The original gives "and," not "after." The action of this clause must either be simultaneous with that of the last or subsequent. Translate, <span class= "ital">and made it into a molten calf.</span><p><span class= "bld">A molten calf.</span>--It has been usual to regard the selection of the "calf" form for the image as due to Egyptian influences. But the Egyptian calf-worship, or, rather, bull-worship, was not a worship of images, but of living animals. A sacred bull, called Apis, was worshipped at Memphis, and another, called Mnevis, at Heliopolis, both being regarded as actual incarnate deities. Had Egyptian ideas been in the ascendant, it would have been natural to select a living bull, which might have "gone before" the people literally. The "molten calf," which had no very exact counterpart in Egypt, perhaps points back to an older idolatry, such as is glanced at in <a href="/joshua/24-14.htm" title="Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD.">Joshua 24:14</a>, where the Israelites are warned to "put away the gods which their fathers served on the other side of the flood," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the Euphrates. Certainly the bull form was more distinctive of the Babylonian and Assyrian than of the Egyptian worship, and it may he suspected that the emigrants from Chaldaea had clung through all their wanderings to the mystic symbolism which had been elaborated in that primaeval land, and which they would contrast favourably with the coarse animal worship of Egypt. In Chaldaea, the bull, generally winged and human-headed, represented the combination of wisdom, strength, and omnipresence, which characterises divinity; and this combination might well have seemed to carnal minds no unapt symbol of Jehovah.<p><span class= "bld">These be thy gods.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">This is thy god.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And fashioned it with a graving</span> <span class="cmt_word">tool.</span> Rather, "and bound it (the gold) in a bag." Compare <a href="/2_kings/5-23.htm">2 Kings 5:23</a>, where the same two Hebrew words occur in the same sense. It is impossible to extract from the original the sense given in the Authorised Version, since the simple copula van cannot mean "after." When two verbs in the same tense are conjoined by van "and," the two actions must be simultaneous, or the latter follow the former. But the calf cannot have been graven first, and then molten. It is objected to the rendering, "he bound it in a bag," that that action is so trivial that it would be superfluous to mention it (Keil). But it is quite consonant with the simplicity of Scripture to mention very trivial circumstances. The act of putting up in bags is mentioned both here and also in <a href="/2_kings/5-23.htm">2 Kings 5:23</a>, and <a href="/2_kings/12-9.htm">2 Kings 12:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They said</span>. The fashioners of the image said this. <span class="cmt_word">These be thy gods</span>. Rather, "This is thy God." Why Aaron selected the form of the calf as that which he would present to the Israelites to receive their worship, has been generally explained by supposing that his thoughts reverted to Egypt, and found in the Apis of Memphis or the Mnevis of Hellopolis the pattern which he thought it best to follow. But there are several objections to this view. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The Egyptian gods had just been discredited by their powerlessness being manifested - it was an odd time at which to fly to them. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Apis and Mnevis were not molten calves, but live bulls.
