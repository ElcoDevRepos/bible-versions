Gold, a precious and incorruptible metal, signifies purity and divinity, reflecting the holiness required in worship. The use of hammered gold indicates skilled craftsmanship, emphasizing the care and precision in creating items for the Tabernacle. This craftsmanship can be seen as a reflection of God&#8217;s intricate design in creation. The lampstand's light is often associated with the illumination of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2-6</a>, where the menorah is linked to the Spirit of God. The menorah also prefigures Christ, who is described as the light of the world in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>.<p><b>It shall be made of one piece, including its base and shaft,</b><br>The instruction for the lampstand to be made of one piece underscores the unity and perfection required in the worship of God. This unity can be seen as a type of the unity of the body of Christ, the Church, as described in <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>. The base and shaft being part of the same piece highlight the stability and centrality of God&#8217;s presence, with the base representing a firm foundation and the shaft symbolizing the central support, much like Christ is the cornerstone and foundation of the Church (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>).<p><b>its cups, and its buds and petals.</b><br>The detailed description of the cups, buds, and petals reflects the beauty and intricacy of God&#8217;s creation, reminiscent of the almond blossoms, which are symbols of watchfulness and awakening. The almond tree is the first to blossom in Israel, symbolizing new life and resurrection, pointing to Christ&#8217;s resurrection and His role as the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>). The floral design also connects to the Garden of Eden, suggesting a return to the divine presence and fellowship with God.

It was composed of a straight stem, rising perpendicularly from a base, and having on either side of it three curved arms or branches, all of them in the same plane, and all rising to the same level. The stem and arms were ornamented with representations of almond flowers, pomegranates, and lily blossoms, repeated as there was room for them, the top ornament being in every case a lily blossom, which held a hemispherical lamp. The form and ornamentation of the base are unknown, since the representation of the base upon the Arch of Titus is manifestly from some Roman work which had superseded the original pedestal. The special object of the candlestick seems to have been to give light by night. Its lamps were to be lighted at even (<a href="/exodus/30-8.htm" title="And when Aaron lights the lamps at even, he shall burn incense on it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.">Exodus 30:8</a>) by the High Priest, and were to burn from evening to morning (<a href="/exodus/27-21.htm" title="In the tabernacle of the congregation without the veil, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute for ever to their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.">Exodus 27:21</a>), when they were to be <span class= "ital">"</span>dressed," or trimmed (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm" title="And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresses the lamps, he shall burn incense on it.">Exodus 30:7</a>), and "extinguished" (Kalisch, <span class= "ital">Comment, on Exodus, </span>p. 370). The Holy Place had sufficient light during the day from the entrance, where the curtain would let the light through, if indeed it were not also partially looped up.<p>(31) <span class= "bld">Of beaten work.</span>--Like the cherubim.

The golden candlestick is figured upon the Arch of Titus, and appears by that representation to have consisted of an upright shaft, from which three curved branches were carried out on either side, all of them in the same plane. It stands there on an octagonal pedestal, in two stages, ornamented with figures of birds and sea-monsters. This pedestal is, however, clearly Roman work, and no part of the original. <span class="cmt_word">Of beaten work</span>. Not cast, but fashioned by the hand, like the cherubim (ver. 18). <span class="cmt_word">His shaft</span>. Rather, "its base" (literally "flank"). <span class="cmt_word">His branches</span>. Our version follows the Septuagint; but the Hebrew noun is in the singular number, and seems to designate the upright stem, or shaft. The "branches are not mentioned till ver. 32, where the same noun is used in the plural. <span class="cmt_word">His bowls, his knops, and his flowers</span>. Rather, "its cups, its pomegranates, and its lilies." The "cups" are afterwards likened to almond flowers (ver. 33); they formed the first ornament on each branch; above them was a representation of the pomegranate fruit; above this a lily blossom. The lily-blossoms supported the lamps, which were separate (ver. 37). The remainder were of one piece with the candlestick. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/25-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then you are to make</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
