In the ancient Near East, locust plagues were a well-known and feared natural disaster. The imagery of covering the land suggests total domination and an inescapable presence, reminiscent of the darkness that would later come as another plague. This also echoes the language used in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the earth was formless and void, indicating chaos and disorder brought by the locusts.<p><b>so that no one can see it.</b><br>The locusts would be so numerous that they would obscure the ground, creating a visual metaphor for the spiritual blindness and hard-heartedness of Pharaoh. This blindness is a recurring theme in Scripture, where physical phenomena often symbolize spiritual realities. The inability to see the land also signifies the loss of control and the impending judgment on Egypt, as God demonstrates His power over creation.<p><b>They will devour whatever is left after the hail</b><br>The previous plague of hail had already devastated much of Egypt's crops, as described in <a href="/exodus/9-25.htm">Exodus 9:25</a>. The locusts would consume what little remained, emphasizing the completeness of God's judgment. This reflects the principle of divine retribution, where the consequences of sin and disobedience are thorough and unavoidable. The locusts' consumption of the remnants highlights the futility of resisting God's will.<p><b>and eat every tree that grows in your fields.</b><br>Trees in the fields represent not only the agricultural wealth of Egypt but also the sustenance and life of the nation. The destruction of these trees signifies a stripping away of resources and security, leaving Egypt vulnerable and exposed. This devastation prefigures the ultimate judgment and deliverance seen in the Passover, where God distinguishes between those who are His and those who are not. The locusts' consumption of the trees also foreshadows the eschatological judgment described in Revelation, where the earth's resources are similarly affected.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, who is delivering God's message to Pharaoh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart is hardened against letting the Israelites go.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are enslaved and where the plagues are taking place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plague_of_locusts.htm">The Plague of Locusts</a></b><br>The eighth plague sent by God to persuade Pharaoh to release the Israelites.

Picture it: the horizon disappears beneath a rolling sea of wings. This is not hyperbole. Scripture records in <a href="/exodus/10-14.htm">Exodus 10:14&#8211;15</a> that &#8220;they covered all the ground until it was black.&#8221; Similar language shows up when God later warns Israel in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a> of locusts consuming their crops, and the prophet Joel echoes the scene, describing a day when &#8220;a great and mighty people&#8221; (<a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>) darken the skies. God is reminding Pharaoh&#8212;and us&#8212;that He can turn daylight into darkness without touching the sun. When He commands creation, creation obeys.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will devour whatever is left after the hail</b><p>The hail of the seventh plague had already shredded Egypt&#8217;s flax and barley (<a href="/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31&#8211;32</a>). What little grain survived now hangs by a thread. Locusts finish the job, chewing through the remnants faster than replanting is possible. <a href="/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47&#8211;48</a> later recalls how God &#8220;gave their crops to the hail and their cattle to lightning.&#8221; The sequence matters: hail first, locusts second, making sure the devastation is total. By stacking judgments, God makes His sovereignty unmistakable&#8212;He controls the weather, the insect world, and the timing of every event.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and eat every tree that grows in your fields</b><p>Egypt&#8217;s fruit trees had appeared untouched, a thin hope for recovery. Not for long. Locusts even strip bark, leaving orchards skeletal (<a href="/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>: &#8220;It has laid waste My vines and splintered My fig trees&#8221;). <a href="/deuteronomy/28-42.htm">Deuteronomy 28:42</a> warns Israel that disobedience would invite the same fate: &#8220;Swarms of locusts will consume all your trees and the produce of your land&#8221;. In other words, there is no safe corner when God judges. Pharaoh&#8217;s refusal to humble himself puts every fig, date, and olive branch at risk.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/exodus/10-5.htm">Exodus 10:5</a> paints a literal, three-stage catastrophe: darkness from a sky filled with locusts, total loss of remaining grain, and the stripping of every tree. Each phrase underscores God&#8217;s unmatched authority and the futility of resisting Him. What hail spared, locusts would destroy, proving that only repentance and obedience bring relief when the Creator speaks.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/exodus/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">They shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth.</span>--This is the case almost invariably with all the severer visitations of locusts. "The plain was covered with them," says Denon (<span class= "ital">Travels,</span> p. 286), speaking of Egypt. "The ground is covered with them for several leagues," declares Volney (<span class= "ital">Travels,</span> vol. i., p. 285)." Over an area of 1,600 or 1,800 square miles," observes Barrow, "the whole surface might literally be said to be covered with them." The Hebrew name, which means "multitudinous," is thus very appropriate.<p><span class= "bld">They</span> <span class= "bld">shall</span> <span class= "bld">eat the residue of that which is escaped . . . every tree.</span>--Comp. <a href="/exodus/9-32.htm" title="But the wheat and the rye were not smitten: for they were not grown up.">Exodus 9:32</a>. The description of Joel has never been surpassed: "A fire devoureth before them, and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and <span class= "ital">nothing</span> <span class= "ital">shall escape them"</span> (<a href="/joel/2-3.htm" title="A fire devours before them; and behind them a flame burns: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yes, and nothing shall escape them.">Joel 2:3</a>). Comp.

Very graphic is Joel again in respect of this last feature: "He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white" (<a href="/joel/1-7.htm" title="He has laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he has made it clean bore, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.">Joel 1:7</a>). Nor is it only shrubs, but even trees, that suffer. "They are particularly injurious to the palm-trees," says Burckhardt; "these they strip of everv leaf and green particle, the trees remaining like skeletons, with bare branches."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth</span>. This is one of the points most frequently noticed by travellers. "The ground is covered with them for several leagues," says Volney. "The steppes," says Clarke, "were entirely covered by their bodies." "Over an area of 1600 or 1800 square miles," observes Barrow, "the whole surface might literally be said to be covered with them." <span class="cmt_word">They shall eat the residue of that which escaped</span>. Locusts eat every atom of verdure in the district attacked by them. "In A.D. ," says Barhebraeus, "a large swarm of locusts appeared in the land of Mosul and Baghdad, and it was very grievous in Shiraz. It left no herb nor even leaf on the trees. When their swarms appear," writes Volney, "everything green vanishes instantaneously from the fields, as if a curtain were rolled up; the trees and plants stand leafless, and nothing is seen but naked boughs and stalks." <span class="cmt_word">And shall eat every tree</span>. The damage done by locusts to trees is very great. "He (the locust) has laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree; he hath made it clean bare and east it away; the branches thereof are made white" (<a href="/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>). Travellers constantly notice this fact. "When they have devoured all other vegetables," says one, "they attack the trees, consuming first the leaves, then the bark." "After having consumed herbage, fruit, leaves of trees," says another, "they attacked even their young shoots and their bark." "They are particularly injurious to the palm-trees," writes a third; "these they strip of every leaf and green particle, the trees remaining like skeletons with bare branches." A fourth notes that "the bushes were eaten quite bare, though the animals could not have been long on the spot. They sat by hundreds on a bush, gnawing the rind and the woody fibres."
