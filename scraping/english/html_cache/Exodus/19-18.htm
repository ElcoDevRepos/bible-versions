The enveloping smoke signifies the divine presence and holiness of God, creating a barrier between the sacred and the profane. This imagery is reminiscent of the smoke that filled the temple in <a href="/isaiah/6-4.htm">Isaiah 6:4</a>, symbolizing God's glory and majesty. The smoke also serves as a protective veil, shielding the Israelites from the full intensity of God's presence, which no mortal could withstand.<p><b>because the LORD had descended on it in fire</b><br>Fire is a frequent biblical symbol of God's presence, purity, and judgment. It recalls the burning bush in <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>, where God first revealed Himself to Moses. Fire represents God's holiness and consuming nature, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>, "For our God is a consuming fire." This descent in fire prefigures the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, described in <a href="/acts/2-3.htm">Acts 2:3</a>, where tongues of fire rested on the apostles, signifying God's empowering presence.<p><b>And the smoke rose like the smoke of a furnace</b><br>The comparison to a furnace emphasizes the intensity and overwhelming nature of God's presence. A furnace, used for refining metals, symbolizes purification and judgment. This imagery connects to the refining process described in <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, where God purifies His people. The furnace-like smoke also evokes the imagery of Sodom and Gomorrah's destruction in <a href="/genesis/19-28.htm">Genesis 19:28</a>, underscoring the seriousness of God's holiness and the consequences of sin.<p><b>and the whole mountain quaked violently</b><br>The violent quaking of Mount Sinai signifies the power and majesty of God, who controls the natural world. Earthquakes in the Bible often accompany divine revelation or judgment, as seen in <a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>, where the earth quaked at Jesus' crucifixion. This trembling mountain prefigures the eschatological shaking described in <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26-27</a>, where God will once more shake the heavens and the earth, removing what can be shaken to reveal what is unshakable. The quaking underscores the awe and reverence due to God, who is both transcendent and immanent.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>A significant mountain in the Sinai Peninsula where God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses.
