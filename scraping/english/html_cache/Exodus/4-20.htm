This reflects the importance of family unity and support in fulfilling God's calling. The inclusion of his family highlights the personal sacrifice and commitment involved in Moses' mission. It also underscores the significance of family in God's covenantal promises, as seen in the patriarchal narratives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>put them on a donkey</b><br>The use of a donkey for travel indicates the modest means of Moses' family, contrasting with the wealth and power of Egypt. Donkeys were common beasts of burden in the ancient Near East, used for transporting people and goods. This detail connects to other biblical narratives where donkeys play a role, such as Balaam's donkey (Numbers 22) and Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem (<a href="/matthew/21.htm">Matthew 21:1-11</a>), symbolizing humility and peace.<p><b>and headed back to Egypt</b><br>Moses' return to Egypt marks a pivotal moment in the biblical narrative, as he is about to confront Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out of bondage. This journey signifies obedience to God's command and the beginning of the fulfillment of the promises made to Abraham regarding the deliverance of his descendants. Egypt, a place of both refuge and oppression for the Israelites, serves as a backdrop for God's redemptive power.<p><b>And he took the staff of God in his hand</b><br>The staff, once an ordinary shepherd's tool, becomes a symbol of divine authority and power. It is through this staff that God performs miraculous signs, demonstrating His sovereignty over creation and His ability to deliver His people. The staff foreshadows the cross of Christ, through which ultimate deliverance is achieved. The transformation of the staff into a tool of God's power parallels the transformation of Moses from a shepherd to a leader of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is called by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
