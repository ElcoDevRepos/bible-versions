It represents purity and the absence of sin, as leaven is often associated with corruption and sin (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>). The use of unleavened bread in the consecration of priests underscores the need for holiness and separation from sin in those who serve God. This practice is rooted in the Passover tradition (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15-20</a>), where unleavened bread was a reminder of the haste in which the Israelites left Egypt, symbolizing their deliverance and new beginning.<p><b>unleavened cakes mixed with oil</b><br>The unleavened cakes mixed with oil signify the presence and work of the Holy Spirit. Oil is frequently used in Scripture as a symbol of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>, <a href="/zechariah/4.htm">Zechariah 4:1-6</a>). The mixing of oil with the cakes suggests the necessity of the Spirit's involvement in the life and service of the believer. This element of the offering points to the anointing and empowerment required for those who are set apart for God's work, foreshadowing the anointing of Jesus Christ and His followers (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>, <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>).<p><b>and unleavened wafers anointed with oil</b><br>The anointing of unleavened wafers with oil further emphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit in sanctification and consecration. Anointing with oil was a common practice in the Old Testament for setting apart individuals or objects for a holy purpose (<a href="/exodus/30-25.htm">Exodus 30:25-30</a>). This act prefigures the anointing of Jesus as the Messiah, the Anointed One (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>), and the anointing of believers who are called to be a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>Make them out of fine wheat flour</b><br>Fine wheat flour represents the best and most refined offering, indicating the quality and purity required in offerings to God. Wheat was a staple in the ancient Near East, and fine flour was considered a luxury, often reserved for special occasions and offerings (<a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>). This requirement points to the excellence and perfection of Jesus Christ, the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), who offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice without blemish (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). The use of fine flour also highlights the call for believers to offer their best to God in service and worship (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the instructions from God on Mount Sinai regarding the consecration of the priests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>The first priests of Israel, for whom these offerings were prepared as part of their consecration ceremony.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where these offerings were to be presented, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/consecration_ceremony.htm">Consecration Ceremony</a></b><br>A significant event where Aaron and his sons were set apart for priestly service, involving specific rituals and offerings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wheat_flour_offerings.htm">Wheat Flour Offerings</a></b><br>Symbolic elements used in the consecration, representing purity and dedication to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_bread_and_oil.htm">Symbolism of Bread and Oil</a></b><br>Bread made from fine wheat flour signifies purity and sustenance.
