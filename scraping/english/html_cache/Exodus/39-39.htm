Constructed from acacia wood and overlaid with bronze, it symbolized the place where sacrifices were made to atone for the sins of the people. The bronze grating allowed the ashes to fall through, facilitating the burning process. This altar prefigures Christ's ultimate sacrifice on the cross, where He offered Himself as the final atonement for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). The use of bronze, a durable metal, signifies judgment and endurance, reflecting the enduring nature of Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>its poles</b><br>The poles were used to transport the altar, emphasizing the mobility of the Tabernacle as the Israelites journeyed through the wilderness. This mobility signifies God's presence with His people wherever they go. The poles were made of acacia wood and overlaid with bronze, ensuring that the altar could be moved without being touched directly, preserving its sanctity. This practice points to the holiness of God and the reverence required in approaching Him, a theme echoed in the New Testament where believers are called to approach God with reverence and awe (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<p><b>and all its utensils</b><br>The utensils included items such as pots, shovels, basins, forks, and firepans, all made of bronze. These tools were essential for the handling of sacrifices and the maintenance of the altar. Each utensil had a specific purpose, reflecting the order and precision required in worship. This meticulous attention to detail underscores the importance of approaching God with care and respect. The utensils also symbolize the various aspects of Christ's work, as He fulfills every requirement of the law and provides for every need of His people (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p><b>the basin with its stand</b><br>The basin, or laver, was used by the priests for ceremonial washing before they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar. This act of washing symbolizes purification and the need for holiness when serving God. The stand ensured the basin was elevated, signifying the importance of purity in worship. In the New Testament, this concept is fulfilled in Christ, who cleanses believers through His word and sacrifice (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>). The basin's presence in the Tabernacle highlights the ongoing need for spiritual cleansing and preparation in the life of a believer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bronze_altar.htm">Bronze Altar</a></b><br>A central piece of the Tabernacle, used for burnt offerings.
