This phrase highlights the role of Moses as a judge and leader, responsible for resolving conflicts. The need for a judicial system reflects the growing complexity of the Israelite community. This system prefigures the establishment of more formal legal structures in Israel, as seen later in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy.<p><b>it is brought to me to judge between one man and another</b><br>Moses served as the primary judge for the Israelites, a role that required wisdom and discernment. This reflects the patriarchal leadership model prevalent in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where a single leader often held multiple roles, including that of judge. Moses' role as judge foreshadows the role of Christ as the ultimate judge of humanity, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>.<p><b>and I make known to them the statutes and laws of God</b><br>This phrase underscores Moses' role as a mediator between God and the people, revealing divine laws and statutes. The statutes and laws refer to the covenantal instructions given by God, which were foundational for the community's life and worship. This anticipates the giving of the Law at Sinai and highlights the importance of divine revelation in guiding the moral and social conduct of God's people.
