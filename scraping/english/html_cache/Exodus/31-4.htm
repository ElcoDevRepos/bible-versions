In the context of the tabernacle, artistic design was not merely decorative but served a sacred purpose, symbolizing heavenly realities. The skill to design was imparted by God, emphasizing that all talents and gifts are ultimately from Him. This mirrors the creation narrative where God is the ultimate designer, crafting the universe with order and beauty.<p><b>in gold, silver, and bronze</b><br>These materials were significant in ancient Near Eastern cultures, often associated with wealth, royalty, and divinity. Gold, being the most precious, was used extensively in the tabernacle to symbolize purity and the divine presence. Silver often represented redemption, as seen in the silver shekels used for atonement (<a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>). Bronze, used for the altar and other furnishings, symbolized judgment and endurance. The use of these metals in the tabernacle's construction pointed to the value and holiness of the worship space, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption and judgment fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bezalel.htm">Bezalel</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman chosen by God to oversee the construction of the Tabernacle and its furnishings.

Entrusting Bezalel with gold workmanship shows the Lord&#8217;s care for every detail of His dwelling among Israel.<p>&#8226; Gold, the most precious metal, pictures God&#8217;s holiness and glory (<a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>).

Theodore of Samos (ab. B.C. 600-560) was an architect, a worker in bronze, and an engraver of hard stones. Michael Angelo was an architect, painter, and sculptor. Giotto was the same, and also a worker in mosaic. It is some time before, in each particular people or country, the imitative arts become separated, and each artist aspires to eminence in one branch only.

It was an art very early practised both in Chaldaea and in Egypt.

It has been said that "as everything that had to be done was prescribed in strict and precise detail, there was to be no exercise of original powers of invention nor of taste" (Cook); but this was scarcely so. The forms of the cherubim, the patterns to be woven into the stuffs, or embroidered on them, the shapes of the vessels, of the capitals of the pillars, and of the laver were not prescribed in the directions. Bezaleel and Aholiab would have had to design them after such a description as Moses could give of the "pattern" which he had seen in the mount. In doing this, there would be much room for the exercise of inventive power and taste. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/31-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">to design</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#7717;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2803.htm">Strong's 2803: </a> </span><span class="str2">To think, account</span><br /><br /><span class="word">artistic works in gold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1445;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(baz&#183;z&#257;&#183;h&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2091.htm">Strong's 2091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gold, something gold-colored, as oil, a clear sky</span><br /><br /><span class="word">silver,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;ak&#183;ke&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3701.htm">Strong's 3701: </a> </span><span class="str2">Silver, money</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and bronze,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;an&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5178.htm">Strong's 5178: </a> </span><span class="str2">Copper, something made of that metal, coin, a fetter, base</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/exodus/31-4.htm">OT Law: Exodus 31:4 To devise skillful works to work (Exo.
