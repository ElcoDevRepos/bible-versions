The conception and birth of Moses occur during a time of great oppression for the Israelites in Egypt. Pharaoh had decreed that all Hebrew male infants be killed at birth (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>), making the birth of a son particularly perilous. This act of giving birth under such circumstances demonstrates the faith and courage of Moses' parents, Amram and Jochebed (<a href="/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a>). The birth of Moses is significant as it sets the stage for the deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, a pivotal event in biblical history.<p><b>When she saw that he was a beautiful child,</b><br>The description of Moses as a "beautiful child" can be understood in several ways. The Hebrew word used here can mean "good" or "fine," suggesting not only physical beauty but also a sense of special purpose or divine favor. This echoes the creation narrative where God saw that His creation was "good" (Genesis 1). In <a href="/acts/7-20.htm">Acts 7:20</a> and <a href="/hebrews/11-23.htm">Hebrews 11:23</a>, Moses is also described as "no ordinary child," indicating that his parents recognized something extraordinary about him, which may have strengthened their resolve to protect him. This perception of Moses' uniqueness foreshadows his future role as a leader and prophet.<p><b>she hid him for three months.</b><br>Hiding Moses for three months was a courageous act of defiance against Pharaoh's edict. This period of concealment reflects the desperate measures taken by his family to preserve his life. The number three often signifies completeness or divine intervention in the Bible, as seen in the three days Jonah spent in the belly of the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>) and Jesus' resurrection on the third day (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). The act of hiding Moses can be seen as an early indication of God's providential care and protection over him, which continues throughout his life. This concealment also parallels the later hiding of Jesus from Herod's massacre of the innocents (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13-16</a>), drawing a typological connection between Moses and Christ as deliverers of their people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses'_mother.htm">Moses' Mother (Jochebed)</a></b><br>The mother of Moses, who is not named in this verse but is later identified as Jochebed.
