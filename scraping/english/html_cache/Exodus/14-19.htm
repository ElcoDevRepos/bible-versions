This divine presence had been leading the Israelites since their departure from Egypt, symbolizing God's guidance and protection. The term "angel" in Hebrew can mean "messenger," indicating a direct representation of God's will. This aligns with other instances in Scripture where God leads His people, such as the pillar of fire and cloud in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>.<p><b>withdrew and went behind them.</b><br>This strategic movement signifies a shift from guidance to protection. By moving behind the Israelites, the angel of God positions Himself between the Israelites and the pursuing Egyptian army, demonstrating God's role as a protector. This act of divine intervention is reminiscent of God's promise to be a shield to His people, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>. It also foreshadows the protective role of Christ, who stands between believers and their adversaries.<p><b>The pillar of cloud also moved from before them and stood behind them,</b><br>The pillar of cloud, a visible manifestation of God's presence, served as both guidance and protection. Its movement to the rear of the camp emphasizes God's active role in safeguarding His people. This cloud had been a constant presence since the Exodus began, symbolizing God's faithfulness. The dual role of the cloud as both guide and protector is echoed in <a href="/psalms/105-39.htm">Psalm 105:39</a>, which speaks of God's provision and care. The cloud's movement can also be seen as a type of Christ, who leads and protects His followers, ensuring their deliverance from spiritual bondage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_god.htm">The Angel of God</a></b><br>A divine messenger or manifestation of God, often seen as a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ in conservative Christian theology.

The angel is distinguished from the cloud, and represented as antedating its movements and directing them. It is clear that the object of the movement now made was double: (1) to check and trouble the Egyptians by involving them in "cloud and darkness;" and (2) to cheer and assist the Israelites by affording them abundant light for all their necessary arrangements. Although there is nothing in the original corresponding to our translators' expressions, "to them," "to these," yet those expressions seem to do no more than to bring out the true sense. (Comp, the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan, the Syriac Version, and the <span class= "ital">Commentaries</span> of Rosenmller, Maurer, Knobel, and Kaliseh.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19-22.</span> - THE PASSAGE OF THE RED SEA. The Egyptians had arrived in the near neighbourhood of the Israelite camp, at the close of a long day's march, towards evening. Having ascertained that the fugitives were still, as they had expected them to be, shut in between the sea and the wilderness, they were content, and made no immediate attack, but encamped over against them. Hereupon, "the pillar of the cloud," which was at the time in front of the Israelite camp - probably near the point where God intended the passage of the sea to be effected "removed" from this position, and placed itself directly behind the Israelite encampment, between them and the Egyptians. This movement alone was calculated to alarm the latter, and prevent them from stirring till near daybreak; but, the better to secure their inaction, the pillar was made to overshadow them with a deep and preternatural darkness, so that it became almost impossible for them to advance. Meanwhile, on the side which was turned towards the Israelites, the pillar presented the appearance of a bright flame, lighting up the whole encampment, and rendering it as easy to make ready for the march as it would have been by day. Thus, the beasts were collected and laden the columns marshalled and prepared to proceed in a certain fixed order - and everything made ready for starting so soon as the bed of the sea should be sufficiently dry. Moses, about nightfall, descending to the water's edge, stretched forth his rod over the waves, and, an east wind at once springing up - accompanied perhaps by a strong ebb of the tide - the waters of the gulf were parted in the vicinity of the modern Suez, and a dry space left between the Bitter Lakes, which were then a prolongation of the Gulf, and the present sea-bed. The space may have been one of considerable width. The Israelites entering upon it, perhaps about midnight, accomplished the distance, which may not have exceeded a mile, with all their belongings, in the course of five or six hours, the pillar of the cloud withdrawing itself, as the last Israelites entered the sea-bed, and retiring after them like a rearguard. Thus protected, they made the transit in safety, and morning saw them encamped upon the shores of Asia. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The angel of God</span>.
