In the context of Exodus, God frequently speaks to Moses, establishing him as a prophet and leader. This divine communication underscores the seriousness of the instructions that follow.<p><b>Go down and warn the people</b><br>God instructs Moses to descend from Mount Sinai to deliver a warning to the Israelites. This highlights the importance of obedience and reverence in approaching God. The mountain is a sacred space, and the people must be prepared to encounter the divine presence. This command reflects the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the need for human beings to approach Him with respect and caution.<p><b>not to break through to see the LORD</b><br>The Israelites are cautioned against attempting to penetrate the boundary set around the mountain to catch a glimpse of God. This reflects the biblical understanding of God's holiness and the danger of approaching Him in an unworthy manner. The concept of boundaries is significant in the Old Testament, symbolizing the separation between the holy and the profane. This also foreshadows the veil in the temple, which separates the Holy of Holies, where God's presence dwells.<p><b>lest many of them perish</b><br>The warning concludes with a grave consequence: death for those who disobey. This underscores the seriousness of God's holiness and the need for reverence. The idea that seeing God could lead to death is consistent with other biblical passages, such as when God tells Moses that no one can see His face and live (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>).

"Bounds" were set, and the people required to keep within them. Actual contact with the mountain was forbidden under penalty of death (<a href="/exodus/19-12.htm" title="And you shall set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that you go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whoever touches the mount shall be surely put to death:">Exodus 19:12</a>). It is evident from <a href="/exodus/19-23.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for you charged us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.">Exodus 19:23</a> that the command to "set bounds" had been obeyed, and a fence erected which it would have required some force to "break through;" nor can there be any doubt that Moses had promulgated the directions, which he had received from God, forbidding any approach to the mount, and threatening death to those who should "touch" it. Yet still it is evident from this concluding paragraph of the chapter (<a href="/context/exodus/19-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.">Exodus 19:21-25</a>) that the first warning was insufficient. An intention to "break through, to gaze," must have been entertained by many. To this intention the existing priesthood, whatever it was, were parties (<a href="/exodus/19-22.htm" title="And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth on them.">Exodus 19:22</a>). It always grates upon men's feelings to be told that they are less holy than others; and we can easily understand that those who had hitherto acted as priests to the nation would resent their exclusion from "holy ground" to which the sons of Amram were about to be admitted. Even of the people there may have been many who participated in the feeling, and thought that Moses and Aaron were "taking too much upon them, seeing that the whole congregation" was holy. Hence, a further very stringent command was requisite, and Moses, having reached the summit, was sent down again from the top to the bottom in order to enjoin upon priests and people alike, in the most solemn possible way, the necessity of their observing the bounds set.<p>(21) <span class= "bld">Lest they break through</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, <span class= "ital">force their way through the barrier which Moses had erected.</span><p><span class= "bld">To gaze, and many of them perish.</span>--Some might have perished by the execution of the orders given in <a href="/exodus/19-13.htm" title="There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.">Exodus 19:13</a>. But the allusion is perhaps rather to such a heaven-sent plague as destroyed the men of Beth-shemesh to the number of 50,070 (<a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm" title="And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and three score and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.">1Samuel 6:19</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-25.</span> - <span class="accented">The further warning to the people and the priests</span>. It is very remarkable that, after all the directions given (vers. 10-13), and all the pains taken by Moses and the Israelites themselves (vers. 14, 15, 23), God should still have thought it necessary to interpose with a fresh warning, and to send Moses back from the top of the mount to the bottom, in order to communicate the renewed warning to the people. We can only suppose that, in spite of the instructions previously given and the precautions taken, there were those among the people who were prepared to "break through" the fence, and invade the mount, and who would have done so, to their own destruction (ver. 21), but for this second warning. The special mention of the "priests" (vers. 22, 24) raises the suspicion, that this proud and rebellious spirit was particularly developed among them. Accustomed to the exercise of sacred functions, they may have been inclined to regard their own purity as equal to that of Moses and Aaron; and they may even have resented their exclusion from a sacred spot to which the two sons of Amram were admitted. Apparently, they had conceived that the injunction to go through the recognised ceremonies of purification (ver. 10) did not apply to them, and had neglected to do so, on which account a special command had to be issued, addressed to them only (ver. 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Charge the people lest they break through</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "lest they force a passage through the barrier made by Moses" in accordance with the command given in ver. 12. <span class="cmt_word">And many of them perish</span>. Irreverent gazing on holy things was forbidden by the law (<a href="/numbers/4-20.htm">Numbers 4:20</a>), and on one occasion (<a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>) was actually punished with death. It did not, however, require a law to make it an offence, natural reason being quite sufficient to teach the duty of reverence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/19-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
