The speaker is Moses, who is conveying a divine message. In the context of <a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17</a>, Moses acts as a mediator between God and the Israelites, highlighting his role as a prophet and leader.<p><b>&#8220;a hand was lifted up toward the throne of the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>This imagery suggests an oath or a gesture of defiance. In ancient Near Eastern culture, raising a hand could signify swearing an oath or invoking divine witness. The "throne of the LORD" symbolizes God's sovereign authority and presence. This phrase may imply that the Amalekites' actions were seen as a direct challenge to God's rule, as they attacked the Israelites unprovoked (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8</a>).<p><b>The LORD will war against Amalek</b><br>This statement indicates divine retribution and justice. The Amalekites were a nomadic tribe, descendants of Esau, and their attack on the Israelites is seen as an affront to God's chosen people. This declaration of perpetual conflict underscores God's commitment to protect and vindicate Israel. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's opposition to those who oppose His purposes (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>).<p><b>from generation to generation.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase signifies an ongoing, enduring conflict. It suggests that the enmity between Israel and Amalek would persist through successive generations. Historically, the Amalekites continued to be adversaries of Israel, as seen in the accounts of King Saul (1 Samuel 15) and King David (1 Samuel 30). Theologically, this enduring struggle can be seen as a type of the spiritual warfare between God's people and the forces of evil, with ultimate victory assured through God's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who intercedes for them and communicates God's will.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalek.htm">Amalek</a></b><br>A tribe that attacked the Israelites, representing opposition to God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who promises to fight against Amalek.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, journeying from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rephidim.htm">Rephidim</a></b><br>The location where the battle with Amalek took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_battle.htm">God's Sovereignty in Battle</a></b><br>God is actively involved in the battles His people face, both physical and spiritual.

hands were raised (<a href="/exodus/17-11.htm">Exodus 17:11-12</a>: &#8220;Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed&#8221;).<p>- It sets the tone for an ironclad promise, not a casual remark (cf. <a href="/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he said,</b><p>- The speaker is Moses, functioning as both leader and prophet (<a href="/exodus/34-34.htm">Exodus 34:34</a>).<p>- His words immediately follow the building of an altar named &#8220;The LORD Is My Banner&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>), showing prophetic interpretation of the altar&#8217;s meaning.<p>- Moses is not inventing a hope; he is declaring what God has revealed, just as later prophets would do (<a href="/2_samuel/23-2.htm">2 Samuel 23:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a hand was lifted up toward the throne of the LORD.</b><p>- Two images converge:<p>&#8226;
