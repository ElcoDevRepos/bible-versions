In ancient Israelite law, intent was crucial in determining guilt. The concept of "lying in wait" implies a deliberate and premeditated act, which is condemned in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>). This distinction is important in understanding the justice system of ancient Israel, which sought to differentiate between different levels of culpability.<p><b>but God allowed it to happen</b><br>This acknowledges divine sovereignty over all events, including accidental deaths. The belief that God allows certain events to occur reflects a worldview where nothing happens outside of God's control. This aligns with other biblical passages that affirm God's sovereignty, such as <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a> and <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>. It suggests that even in cases of accidental death, there is a divine purpose or allowance, which can be a source of comfort and understanding for those involved.<p><b>then I will appoint for you a place where he may flee</b><br>This refers to the establishment of cities of refuge, as detailed in <a href="/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9-34</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/19.htm">Deuteronomy 19:1-13</a>. These cities provided asylum for those who committed manslaughter, protecting them from the avenger of blood until a fair trial could be conducted. The cities of refuge illustrate God's provision for justice and mercy, ensuring that the innocent are protected while awaiting judgment. This system foreshadows the refuge found in Christ, who offers protection and salvation to those who seek Him, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority who allows events to happen according to His sovereign will.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_accidental_killer.htm">The Accidental Killer</a></b><br>A person who has caused the death of another unintentionally, without premeditation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_appointed_place.htm">The Appointed Place</a></b><br>A city of refuge where the accidental killer can flee for safety from the avenger of blood.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is receiving and conveying God's laws to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_avenger_of_blood.htm">The Avenger of Blood</a></b><br>A family member seeking justice for the death of a relative, as was customary in ancient Israelite society.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God is in control of all events, even those that seem accidental.

A place is to be provided whither the man-slayer may flee, and where he may be safe, at any rate until the cause is inquired into. Hitherto, throughout the East, it had been regarded as the duty of the next of kin to avenge homicide of whatever kind, and blood had been exacted for blood, however sudden, however provoked, however excusable had been the homicide. No right of asylum, so far as we know, had ever been established before. The Sinaitic legislation for the first time interposed the "city of refuge," between the "avenger of blood" and his victim. It was for the elders of the city to see that the privilege was not abused. Where the case was doubtful, the man-slayer had to be remitted for trial to the elders of his own town (<a href="/context/numbers/35-22.htm" title="But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast on him any thing without laying of wait,">Numbers 35:22-25</a>); where the elders considered his claim made out, he was entitled to protection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/exodus/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God deliver him into his hand</span>.
