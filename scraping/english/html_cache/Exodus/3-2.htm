In the Old Testament, this figure frequently appears with divine authority and is sometimes equated with God (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a>; <a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-24</a>). The appearance to Moses marks a pivotal moment in biblical history, as God is about to commission Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. This encounter occurs at Mount Horeb, also known as Mount Sinai, a significant location for future divine revelations and the giving of the Law.<p><b>in a blazing fire from within a bush.</b><br>Fire is a common biblical symbol of God's presence, purity, and power (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). The bush, likely a common desert shrub, represents the ordinary being infused with the divine. The fire's presence without consuming the bush signifies God's holiness and the miraculous nature of His revelation. This event foreshadows the divine presence that will accompany the Israelites in the pillar of fire during their desert journey (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>).<p><b>Moses saw the bush ablaze with fire,</b><br>Moses' attention is captured by the unusual sight, indicating the importance of divine encounters in the mundane aspects of life. This moment of curiosity leads to a life-changing encounter with God. Moses, raised in Pharaoh's palace and now a shepherd in Midian, is about to be called into a new role as the leader of God's people. The burning bush serves as a divine interruption in Moses' life, redirecting his path.<p><b>but it was not consumed.</b><br>The bush's resistance to the fire symbolizes God's eternal nature and His ability to sustain and preserve. This miraculous sign reassures Moses of God's power and presence. It also serves as a metaphor for Israel, a nation that will endure despite the fiery trials of slavery and oppression in Egypt. The unconsumed bush can be seen as a type of Christ, who embodies the fullness of God (<a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>) and yet is not overcome by the trials and sufferings of the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A Hebrew man raised in Pharaoh's household, who fled to Midian after killing an Egyptian.

So St. John says of the Baptist (<a href="/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24</a>) that "he was not yet cast into <span class="accented">the</span> prison, meaning, prison into which you all know that he was cast. <span class="accented">Seneh</span>, the word translated "bush," is still the name of a thorny shrub, a species of acacia, common in the Sinaitic district. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/exodus/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There the Angel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1448;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;&#8217;a&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4397.htm">Strong's 4397: </a> </span><span class="str2">A messenger, of God, an angel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1465;&#1493;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">appeared</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1440;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
