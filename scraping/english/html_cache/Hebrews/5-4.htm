In the context of the Old Testament, the priesthood was not a position one could assume by personal ambition or self-appointment. The role of a priest was a sacred duty, requiring a divine mandate. This principle underscores the importance of humility and submission to God's will, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like Moses and David, who were chosen by God for their roles.<p><b>he must be called by God,</b><br>The calling by God is a central theme in the Bible, highlighting God's sovereignty in choosing individuals for specific purposes. This divine calling is evident in the lives of prophets, kings, and apostles. For example, Jeremiah was called by God before he was born (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>), and the Apostle Paul was chosen to be an apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>). This calling is not based on human merit but on God's purpose and grace.<p><b>just as Aaron was.</b><br>Aaron's appointment as the first high priest of Israel is a foundational example of divine calling. In <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>, God specifically chose Aaron and his sons to serve as priests. This established a hereditary priesthood among the Levites, setting a precedent for the priestly office. Aaron's role as high priest also serves as a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest, appointed by God to mediate between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). Aaron's priesthood foreshadows the perfect and eternal priesthood of Jesus, who was also called by God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/5-5.htm">Hebrews 5:5-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

&#8220;Honor&#8221; refers to the high priesthood (<a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>), a sacred office with unique access to God.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently warns against self-appointment to spiritual authority:<p>&#8211; Korah&#8217;s rebellion ended in judgment when he tried to seize priestly privilege (<a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1-35</a>).<p>&#8211; King Saul forfeited his kingdom by usurping priestly duties (<a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8-14</a>).<p>&#8211; Uzziah became leprous for illegally burning incense (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>).<p>&#8226; God alone confers ministry gifts (<a href="/john/3-27.htm">John 3:27</a>; <a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>), keeping His house orderly and protected from pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he must be called by God</b><p>&#8226; Divine calling, not human ambition, legitimizes leadership. <a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a> records the Lord saying, &#8220;Bring near to you your brother Aaron&#8230; that he may minister as priest to Me&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The pattern continues throughout Scripture:<p>&#8211; Prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-5</a>), apostles (<a href="/mark/3-13.htm">Mark 3:13-14</a>), and missionaries (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>) all receive explicit summons from God.<p>&#8211; Jesus Himself waited for the Father&#8217;s commissioning: &#8220;Christ did not take upon Himself the glory of becoming a high priest&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/5-5.htm">Hebrews 5:5</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today:<p>&#8211; Every Christian is part of &#8220;a holy priesthood&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>), yet specific offices&#8212;pastor, elder, teacher&#8212;still require unmistakable divine direction (<a href="/1_timothy/3-1.htm">1 Timothy 3:1-7</a>; <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5-9</a>).<p>&#8211; Calling is affirmed by the Word, the Spirit, and the church, not by personal aspiration alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as Aaron was</b><p>&#8226;

Aaron&#8217;s mediation pointed forward to Christ, the flawless High Priest in the order of Melchizedek (<a href="/hebrews/5-6.htm">Hebrews 5:6-10</a>).<p>&#8226; By invoking Aaron, Hebrews reminds readers that:<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s standards never change&#8212;He still chooses His servants.<p>&#8211; Attempting ministry without His call repeats the sin of Korah and invites discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a> teaches that the priesthood&#8212;and by extension all spiritual leadership&#8212;is an honor that originates with God alone. Self-promotion has no place in His kingdom; He personally calls, equips, and confirms those who will serve, just as He did with Aaron and supremely with Christ. Walking in that divine calling safeguards the church, glorifies the Lord, and keeps ministry rooted in humble obedience rather than human ambition.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">But he that is called.</span>--The true reading requires, <span class= "ital">when he is called.</span> "Not unto himself doth any man take the honour, but when . . ."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And no man taketh this honor unto himself, but being called of God</span> (the 5 of Textus Receptus before <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x28;</span> "he that is called," as in A.V. - has very slight authority), <span class="cmt_word">even as was Aaron.</span> This verse expresses the second essential of a high priest, Divine appointment, for assurance of the efficacy of his mediation.
