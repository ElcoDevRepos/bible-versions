The "covenant" signifies a binding agreement between God and His people, replacing the old covenant of the Law given to Moses.

The declaration by the Lord emphasizes divine authority and the certainty of this promise.<p><b>I will put My laws in their hearts</b><br>This signifies an internalization of God's laws, contrasting with the external adherence required by the Mosaic Law.
