The promise included land, descendants, and blessings (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). This covenant is pivotal as it sets the stage for the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through Abraham's lineage, ultimately leading to the coming of Jesus Christ. The promise is reiterated and expanded in <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15 and 17</a>, emphasizing its importance.<p><b>since He had no one greater to swear by</b><br>In ancient cultures, oaths were sworn by invoking a higher authority to guarantee the truthfulness of one's word. God, being the supreme being, has no higher authority to appeal to. This highlights God's ultimate sovereignty and the absolute certainty of His promises. The concept of swearing by a higher power is seen in various biblical contexts, such as in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, where Jesus discusses the nature of oaths.<p><b>He swore by Himself</b><br>God's self-swearing underscores the unchangeable nature of His promise. This act is unique and signifies the utmost seriousness and reliability of His word. In <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16-18</a>, God swears by Himself after Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac, reinforcing the promise of blessing and multiplication. This self-oath is a profound assurance to believers of God's faithfulness and is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a> and <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where God's word is depicted as irrevocable.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The supreme being who made a promise to Abraham, emphasizing His ultimate authority and faithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch to whom God made a significant promise, highlighting his role as a key figure in the faith account.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promise_to_abraham.htm">Promise to Abraham</a></b><br>Refers to God's covenant with Abraham, which includes blessings and the establishment of a great nation through his descendants.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unchanging_nature.htm">God's Unchanging Nature</a></b><br>God's promise to Abraham is a testament to His unchanging nature and faithfulness.

After Abraham&#8217;s willingness to offer Isaac, God ratified the earlier promise with an oath.<p>&#8226; Hebrews later explains the purpose: &#8220;God wanted to make the unchanging nature of His purpose very clear&#8230; so He confirmed it with an oath&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical implications:<p>&#8211; Assurance of salvation rests not on our performance but on God&#8217;s sworn commitment (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s oath encourages perseverance; He will finish what He began (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p>&#8211; The pledge &#8220;by Himself&#8221; anticipates Christ, in whom all God&#8217;s promises are &#8220;Yes&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a> points to the moment God pledged Himself to fulfill His covenant with Abraham. Because there is no authority higher than God, He swore by His own name, ensuring His promise is absolutely secure. That oath anchors our hope: the God who cannot lie guarantees the inheritance to all who, like Abraham, trust and patiently wait for Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) The connection seems to be this: "You, like them, have promises--promises to which God has given all possible certainty; you, like them, can attain the fulfilment only through faith and patient waiting."<p><span class= "bld">For when God made promise.</span>--It is better to follow the words literally, <span class= "ital">For when to Abraham God had made promise.</span> Abraham is chosen for special mention as the most illustrious example of those who "inherit the promises" (comp. <a href="/john/8-58.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.">John 8:58</a>); also because (1) the assurance given to him was confirmed by oath; and (2) in it lay included the promise of the Christ. The promises made to Abraham were essentially one, with various parts progressively fulfilled. It seems likely that, though the next verse is quoted from <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm" title="That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;">Genesis 22:17</a>, the writer also has in mind ("<span class= "ital">had</span> promised") <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm" title="And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 12:3</a>, and especially Genesis 15.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. And so</span>, <span class="accented">having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</span> Abraham - the ancestor of the Hebrews, the first recipient of the promises, the father of the faithful - is now appropriately adduced as an example. He (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>), as is the case with you (<a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.), was assured of his inheritance by the Divine oath; and so he obtained it, but only through "faith and patience." You have the like assurance, but attended with the like conditions. And then this Divine oath, the significance of which is set forth in vers. 16-18, is made a link of connection between the hortatory section (<a href="/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11-6:20</a>) and the coming argument about Melchizedek. This is one instance of the artistic way in which, throughout the Epistle, the interposed hortatory passages are so turned as to connect the divided sections of the argument. But what is said about Abraham (vers. 13, 14, 15) has been variously understood. It is connected with ver. 12 thus: "<span class="accented">Be</span> ye followers of them who inherit the promises through faith and patience: <span class="accented">for</span> God, in his promise to Abraham, swore by himself in confirmation of it; <span class="accented">and so</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>) through patience he obtained the promise. Be it here observed that <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 15 ("having patiently endured," A.V.) corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 12, and expresses essentially the same idea. The aorist participle <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> does not in itself imply that the patience was previous to the obtaining; it expresses only that by patiently enduring he obtained. Observe also that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> (cf. <a href="/acts/7-8.htm">Acts 7:8</a>; <a href="/acts/27-44.htm">Acts 27:44</a>; <a href="/acts/28-14.htm">Acts 28:14</a>) denotes the <span class="accented">consequence</span> from what has been previously stated; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span> followed from the Divine oath ensuring the fulfillment of the promise. Both his eventually obtaining and his patience in awaiting fulfillment were in consequence of the assuring oath. But then how and when did Abraham himself obtain the promise? Not even the temporal fulfillment in the multiplication of his seed and the inheritance of the Promised Land, much less the spiritual fulfillment in Christ, was during his own life. Both he could but see "afar <span class="accented">off."</span> In respect to the latter it is expressly said (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13, 39</a>) that the patriarchs did <span class="accented">not</span> receive the promises - <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. What, then, is meant by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>? Bleek understands the time of the oath (<a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>.), when the promise was irrevocably assured, to have been the time of obtaining. But more than this is suggested by the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <span class="accented">Hebrews</span> 11:33), as well as by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, viz. the actual attainment of the blessing assured to him by oath. There are two other ways of explaining: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to identify Abraham with his seed, in whom, though not in his own person, he may be conceived to have obtained, - of which view it may be significant that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> of the LXX. (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>) is changed in the Epistle to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>: <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to regard Abraham, still alive in the unseen world, as himself enjoying the fulfillment of the ancient promise. So Delitzsch, who, dwelling on the thought that nothing less than the blessing of Abraham extended to the whole world (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <a href="/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13</a>) can be regarded as complete fulfill-merit, says, "God's oath-sealed word of promise is now fulfilled in Christ, and Abraham, while living on in the unseen world, is conscious of and enjoys that fulfillment, and so may be said to have "obtained the promise." This view derives some support from <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>, where the longings of the pilgrim patriarchs is so beautifully represented as reaching to a heavenly fulfillment. On the other hand, the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span> is against it, and hence view <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> may be accepted as a sufficient explanation of the expression (see below, or <a href="/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39</a>).
