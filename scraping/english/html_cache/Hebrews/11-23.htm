This act of faith is rooted in their trust in God's promises to Israel, despite the oppressive circumstances under Pharaoh's rule. The historical context is the Israelites' enslavement in Egypt, where Pharaoh had decreed that all Hebrew male infants be killed (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>). The three-month period signifies a time of intense danger and reliance on God for protection. This act of hiding Moses is a precursor to his future role as a deliverer, foreshadowing Christ's own concealment from Herod's decree (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13-15</a>).<p><b>because they saw that he was a beautiful child</b><br>The description of Moses as "beautiful" goes beyond physical appearance, suggesting a sense of divine purpose or favor. In <a href="/acts/7-20.htm">Acts 7:20</a>, Stephen refers to Moses as "no ordinary child," indicating a recognition of God's special plan for him. This perception by his parents may have been a spiritual insight, prompting them to protect him despite the risks. The beauty here can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also recognized as having a unique purpose from birth (<a href="/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25-32</a>).<p><b>and they were unafraid of the king&#8217;s edict</b><br>The courage of Moses' parents is highlighted by their disregard for Pharaoh's command. This defiance is an act of civil disobedience rooted in faith, prioritizing God's will over human authority. Their fearlessness is reminiscent of other biblical figures who chose to obey God rather than men, such as Daniel (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>) and the apostles (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>). This boldness is a testament to their trust in God's sovereignty and protection, serving as an example of faith overcoming fear, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses'_parents.htm">Moses' Parents (Amram and Jochebed)</a></b><br>The parents of Moses, who demonstrated great faith by hiding their son despite the king's edict to kill all Hebrew male infants.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh's_edict.htm">Pharaoh's Edict</a></b><br>The decree issued by the Pharaoh of Egypt to kill all newborn Hebrew boys to control the population of the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and where Moses was born and hidden.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/faith.htm">Faith</a></b><br>The underlying theme of <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, highlighting the trust and confidence in God's promises and protection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/courageous_faith.htm">Courageous Faith</a></b><br>Moses' parents exemplified courageous faith by defying the king's edict.
