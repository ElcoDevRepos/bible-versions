In biblical context, the role of a high priest was not self-assumed but required a calling from God, as seen in the appointment of Aaron (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). This divine designation underscores Jesus' authority and legitimacy in His priestly role, aligning with the theme of divine selection found throughout Scripture (<a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a>).<p><b>as high priest</b><br>The high priest in Jewish tradition was the mediator between God and the people, offering sacrifices for sins. Jesus' role as high priest signifies His unique position as the ultimate mediator, offering Himself as the perfect sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>). This role fulfills the Old Testament sacrificial system, pointing to Jesus as the fulfillment of the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>in the order of Melchizedek</b><br>Melchizedek, a mysterious figure from <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>, was both a king and priest, predating the Levitical priesthood. His order is eternal and not based on lineage, unlike the Aaronic priesthood. This connection highlights Jesus' eternal priesthood, superior to the Levitical system, and His role as both king and priest. <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a> prophesies about a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek, which the author of Hebrews applies to Jesus, emphasizing His eternal and unchangeable priesthood (<a href="/hebrews/7-17.htm">Hebrews 7:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, recognized as the Son of God and the Savior of humanity.
