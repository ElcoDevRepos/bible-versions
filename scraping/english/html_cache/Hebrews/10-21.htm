In the Old Testament, the high priest was the mediator between God and the people, offering sacrifices for sins. Jesus, as the great priest, fulfills and surpasses this role by offering Himself as the perfect sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-27</a>). This priesthood is in the order of Melchizedek, a king-priest figure from <a href="/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>, which signifies an eternal and superior priesthood compared to the Levitical priesthood (<a href="/hebrews/5-6.htm">Hebrews 5:6, 7</a>:17).<p><b>over the house of God,</b><br>The "house of God" refers to the spiritual household or community of believers, the Church (<a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>). In the Old Testament, the house of God was the temple in Jerusalem, where God's presence dwelt. However, under the New Covenant, the Church is the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a>). Jesus, as the great priest, presides over this spiritual house, ensuring access to God and maintaining the believers' relationship with Him. This reflects the fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God promises to write His law on the hearts of His people, establishing a new covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest.htm">High Priest</a></b><br>In the context of Hebrews, Jesus Christ is identified as the High Priest.

Just as &#8220;confidence&#8221; to draw near flows from Christ&#8217;s sacrifice, so does our assurance that He ministers for us right now (compare <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Since We Have</b><p>&#8226; The author does not say &#8220;if we might obtain&#8221; but &#8220;since we have.&#8221; It is a present, settled possession.<p>&#8226; Believers already enjoy what generations under the old covenant only anticipated (<a href="/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39-40</a>).<p>&#8226; Other passages echo this certainty: &#8220;We have this hope as an anchor for the soul&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>), and &#8220;We have an Advocate with the Father&#8212;Jesus Christ the Righteous One&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A Great Priest</b><p>&#8226; Earlier, the writer spoke of &#8220;a great high priest who has passed through the heavens&#8212;Jesus the Son of God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>). Here he shortens the title but heightens its impact: Jesus is not merely &#8220;a&#8221; priest; He is &#8220;great.&#8221;<p>&#8226; His greatness rests on:<p>&#8211; Perfect sinlessness (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>).<p>&#8211; Once-for-all sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>; 9:12).<p>&#8211; Endless life and unchanging priesthood (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Because His priesthood is perfect, He never fails to intercede: &#8220;He is able to save completely those who draw near to God through Him&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Over the House of God</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;House&#8221; refers to God&#8217;s people rather than a physical building. Hebrews already defined it: &#8220;Christ is faithful as the Son over God&#8217;s house. And we are His house, if we hold fast our confidence&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; As High Priest, Jesus rules and serves within His own household:<p>&#8211; He cleanses our consciences (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<p>&#8211; He grants bold access (<a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>).<p>&#8211; He shepherds us in ongoing sanctification (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores communal identity. We are not isolated worshipers scrambling for attention; we stand together under one authoritative, caring Priest (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/10-21.htm">Hebrews 10:21</a> anchors our confidence in the living, present ministry of Jesus. We already possess&#8212;right now&#8212; a &#8220;great priest&#8221; whose sinless sacrifice, eternal life, and sovereign care secure every believer. Because He presides &#8220;over the house of God,&#8221; we may draw near with full assurance, worship together as one family, and rest in His unending intercession.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">An high priest</span>.--The Greek words properly signify a <span class= "ital">great priest</span> (comp. <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14</a>), which is one of the names by which the high priest is frequently designated, both in the Hebrew (Leviticus 21, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and in the LXX. It may seem strange that the writer should here make use of a new word in the place of that which has occurred so frequently. But there is strong reason for believing that the language of one of the prophecies of Zechariah (<a href="/context/zechariah/6-11.htm" title="Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;">Zechariah 6:11-13</a>) is here before his mind. In the preceding verses (<a href="/context/zechariah/6-12.htm" title="And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:">Zechariah 6:12-14</a>) he has used words which united sacerdotal and kingly imagery; and it would be remarkable if this did not lead his thought to that prophecy. On the head of Joshua, "the great priest" (<a href="/zechariah/6-11.htm" title="Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;">Zechariah 6:11</a>), are placed crowns of silver and gold in token of royal dignity: then follows the prediction of Him of whom Joshua was the type. "He shall build the house of the Lord: and He shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon His throne; and He shall be a priest upon His throne." In the verse before us are combined several of the characteristic thoughts of that passage--the great priest, the priestly ruler, the house of God. The last-mentioned words are repeatedly used throughout the Old Testament, both in the Pentateuch and in later books, for the Tabernacle or Temple of God. In <a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a> (to which there is a manifest allusion here) the meaning is enlarged, but only so that under "the house" is also comprised the <span class= "ital">household</span> of God. Here the two thoughts are combined. Into the house of God we may enter; over it Jesus rules as "the great Priest." The family of God subject to His rule includes the whole community of "the people of God" in heaven and upon earth.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/10-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and [since we have]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a great</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#941;&#947;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(megan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3173.htm">Strong's 3173: </a> </span><span class="str2">Large, great, in the widest sense. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">High Priest</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#941;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hierea)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2409.htm">Strong's 2409: </a> </span><span class="str2">A priest, one who offers sacrifice to a god (in Jewish and pagan religions; of Christians only met.).
