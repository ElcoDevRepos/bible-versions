The tribe of Levi was set apart for religious duties, and only the descendants of Aaron, a Levite, could serve as priests. This command is rooted in the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where the Levites were chosen to serve in the tabernacle and later the temple, performing sacrifices and maintaining the sacred rituals. This priesthood is a type of the greater priesthood of Jesus Christ, who is described as a priest in the order of Melchizedek, transcending the Levitical order.<p><b>to collect a tenth from the people</b><br>The collection of a tenth, or tithe, was a requirement under the Mosaic Law, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-33</a> and <a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>. The tithe was intended to support the Levites, who had no inheritance of land like the other tribes, as their role was to serve God and the community in religious matters. This practice underscores the principle of giving back to God a portion of what He has provided, a concept that continues in various forms in Christian teachings today.<p><b>that is, from their brothers</b><br>The phrase "from their brothers" emphasizes the familial and covenantal relationship among the Israelites. All the tribes, including Levi, were descendants of Abraham, and thus shared a common heritage and responsibility. This familial language highlights the unity and mutual support expected within the covenant community, where the Levites served on behalf of their fellow Israelites.<p><b>though they too are descended from Abraham</b><br>This phrase points to the shared ancestry of the Levites and the rest of the Israelites, all being descendants of Abraham. It underscores the idea that the Levites, despite their special role, are not inherently superior but are part of the same covenant family. This connection to Abraham is significant, as it ties the Levitical priesthood to the broader narrative of God's promises to Abraham, including the promise of blessing to all nations, which finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levi.htm">Levi</a></b><br>The third son of Jacob and Leah, Levi is the ancestor of the tribe of Levi, which was set apart for priestly duties in Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>Members of the tribe of Levi who were given the responsibility of performing sacrifices and maintaining the temple rituals.

There is an apparent difficulty here. The priests, it is urged, did not receive tithes from the people; the tithe was paid to the Levites, and but the tenth part of this tithe fell to the lot of the priests. Two considerations seem entirely to remove this difficulty. (1) The question is not one of emolument, but of position. The authority to exact tithes was in strictness vested in the priests, the supreme guardians of the laws relating to all religious duties and observances, and the Levites were but their assistants. That the priests received for their own use but a part of the tribute paid by the nation is a matter of no moment here. (2) The Levites themselves paid tithes to the priests, who therefore stood alone in receiving tithes but paying none. It is the positive ordinance of the law, and nothing but this, that raises brethren above brethren, and gives to the priest this claim upon men who would otherwise be on an equality with himself through common descent from Abraham.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they indeed of the song of Levi who receive the office of priesthood have commandment to receive tithes of the people according to the Law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham: but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath received tithes of Abraham</span>. As much as to say, "Let it not be said that the tithing of Abraham by Melchizedek implies no higher priestly prerogative than the tithing of Abraham's descendants by the sons of Aaron; for there is this difference: They, in virtue only of a special ordinance of the Law, not of original right, were allowed to tithe their brethren, though descended from the same great ancestor; he, though not of them or of the race at all, in virtue of his own inherent dignity, tithes the whole race as represented in its patriarch." (We observe how, in place of the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, used when the mere historical incident was referred to, we have here the perfect <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> (as also <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> in what follows, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 9), denoting a completed act, of which the effects and significance remain; Melchizedek, who represents the priesthood after his order, being viewed in permanent relation to Abraham, who represents the chosen race.) And hath blessed him that hath (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the holder of) the promises. But, without all controversy, the less is blessed of the better. The superiority evidenced by bestowal of blessing no less than by receiving of tithe having been thus noticed, the contrast with the Levitical priesthood is continued in the following verses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/7-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
