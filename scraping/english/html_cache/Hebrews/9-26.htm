In the Old Testament, the sacrificial system required repeated offerings for sin, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a> with the Day of Atonement. The idea of Christ suffering repeatedly contradicts the unique and complete nature of His sacrifice. The "foundation of the world" refers to the beginning of creation, highlighting the eternal plan of God for redemption through Christ, as seen in <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>, which speaks of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.<p><b>But now He has appeared once for all at the end of the ages</b><br>The phrase "once for all" underscores the singular and definitive act of Christ's sacrifice, contrasting with the repeated sacrifices of the Old Covenant. "At the end of the ages" indicates the culmination of God's redemptive history, marking the transition from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant. This aligns with <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, which speaks of God sending His Son in the fullness of time. The appearance of Christ is the fulfillment of messianic prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which foretells the suffering servant.<p><b>to do away with sin by the sacrifice of Himself.</b><br>This phrase highlights the purpose and effect of Christ's sacrifice. Unlike the animal sacrifices that could only cover sin temporarily, Christ's sacrifice effectively removes sin, fulfilling the promise of a new covenant in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises to remember sins no more. The self-sacrifice of Christ is a central theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, where John the Baptist identifies Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.

The words "consummation of the age" occur <span class= "ital">five</span> times in St. Matthew's Gospel--<a href="/context/matthew/13-39.htm" title="The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.">Matthew 13:39-40</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-49.htm" title="So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,">Matthew 13:49</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?">Matthew 24:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm" title="Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.">Matthew 28:20</a>. (See the Notes.) The phrase here is more expressive still. The history of all preceding ages was a preparation for the manifestation of the Christ ("who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times" (literally, <span class= "ital">at the end of the times</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span><a href="/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1Peter 1:20</a>; all subsequent history develops the results of that manifestation. A similar thought is contained in St. Paul's words "the fulness of the seasons" (<a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>), "the fulness of the time" (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>). (See further the Note on <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>.) . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/9-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Otherwise,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#960;&#949;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Epei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1893.htm">Strong's 1893: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of time: when, after; of cause: since, because; otherwise: else.
