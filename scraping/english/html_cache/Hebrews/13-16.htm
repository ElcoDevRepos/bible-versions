In the context of the early Christian community, doing good was a tangible expression of faith, reflecting the teachings of Jesus, who went about doing good (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>). The call to not neglect suggests a proactive approach, indicating that believers should be intentional and consistent in their good works. This aligns with <a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-17</a>, which stresses that faith without works is dead, underscoring the necessity of actions that reflect one's beliefs.<p><b>and to share with others</b><br>Sharing with others was a fundamental aspect of the early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where believers held all things in common and distributed to anyone as they had need. This practice was rooted in the Jewish tradition of community support and hospitality, which was vital in a time without social safety nets. Sharing is not merely about material possessions but also includes time, talents, and spiritual gifts, fostering unity and mutual support within the body of Christ.<p><b>for with such sacrifices</b><br>The term "sacrifices" here draws a parallel to the Old Testament sacrificial system, where offerings were made to atone for sin and express devotion to God. However, in the New Covenant, the focus shifts from ritualistic animal sacrifices to spiritual sacrifices, such as acts of kindness and generosity. This is echoed in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to present their bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God. Such sacrifices are a reflection of Christ's ultimate sacrifice and are a way for believers to emulate His selflessness.<p><b>God is pleased</b><br>The idea that God is pleased with these sacrifices highlights the relational aspect of faith. Unlike the impersonal deities of surrounding cultures, the God of the Bible is personal and responsive to the actions of His people. This pleasure is not about earning salvation but about living in a way that honors God and reflects His character. <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> states that without faith, it is impossible to please God, indicating that these actions are an outgrowth of genuine faith. The pleasure of God in these sacrifices also connects to the prophetic vision of a restored relationship between God and humanity, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>, where true fasting is defined by acts of justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

Neglect is passive&#8212;simply failing to notice or respond. Hebrews has already cautioned against &#8220;neglecting&#8221; salvation (<a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>), and James echoes, &#8220;Anyone&#8230; who knows the right thing to do, yet fails to do it, is guilty of sin&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>). Instead of drifting, we intentionally watch for ways God invites us to serve, remembering that &#8220;let us not grow weary in doing good&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to do good</b><p>Doing good is active benevolence springing from a redeemed heart (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).

The early believers &#8220;held everything in common&#8221; and met needs daily (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>). Paul instructs the well-resourced &#8220;to be rich in good works, generous and ready to share&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-18.htm">1 Timothy 6:18</a>).<p>Practical avenues:<p>&#8226; Financial giving: supporting missionaries, benevolence funds, and neighbors in crisis.<p>&#8226; Hospitality: opening homes and tables (<a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Skill-sharing: tutoring, mentoring, repairing, or counseling.<p>&#8226; Encouragement: sharing words that build up, a resource often more scarce than money (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for with such sacrifices</b><p>The writer links our generosity to Old-Testament offerings, showing that tangible love is worship. Animal sacrifices have been fulfilled in Christ, yet &#8220;offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). When the Philippians sent aid, Paul called it &#8220;a fragrant offering&#8230; well-pleasing to God&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>).
