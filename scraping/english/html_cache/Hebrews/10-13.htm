After His sacrificial death and resurrection, Jesus ascended to the right hand of the Father, marking the completion of His earthly ministry. This time is significant as it marks the beginning of the Church Age, where believers are called to spread the Gospel. The phrase underscores the transition from Christ's active work on earth to His current position of authority in heaven.<p><b>He waits</b><br>The concept of waiting here implies a period of anticipation and expectation. Jesus, having completed His redemptive work, now awaits the fulfillment of God's plan for the final subjugation of His enemies. This waiting is not passive but is characterized by His ongoing intercession for believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). It reflects the already-but-not-yet tension of the Kingdom of God, where Christ's victory is assured but not yet fully realized on earth.<p><b>for His enemies</b><br>The enemies of Christ include all spiritual and earthly powers opposed to God's rule. This encompasses Satan, demonic forces, and those who reject the Gospel. The imagery of enemies is consistent with biblical themes of spiritual warfare and the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom. In a broader sense, it includes sin and death, which were defeated at the cross but will be fully eradicated at Christ's return.<p><b>to be made a footstool for His feet</b><br>This imagery is drawn from ancient Near Eastern customs where a victorious king would place his feet on the necks of defeated foes, symbolizing total conquest and subjugation. Biblically, it echoes <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, a messianic prophecy that speaks of the Messiah's ultimate victory. The footstool metaphor signifies complete dominion and authority, affirming Christ's sovereignty over all creation. This fulfillment will be realized at the Second Coming, when Christ will establish His eternal reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who is seated at the right hand of God, waiting for His enemies to be subdued.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_christ.htm">Enemies of Christ</a></b><br>Refers to all forces opposed to Christ's rule and authority, both spiritual and earthly.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/footstool.htm">Footstool</a></b><br>A metaphorical term indicating complete subjugation and victory over enemies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The place where Christ is seated at the right hand of God, signifying His authority and completed work.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>The body of believers who are part of Christ's kingdom and await the fulfillment of His victory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_completed_work.htm">Christ's Completed Work</a></b><br>Jesus' position at the right hand of God signifies the completion of His redemptive work.
