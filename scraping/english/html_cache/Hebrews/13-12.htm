This is significant because it fulfills the typology of the Old Testament sacrificial system, where the sin offerings were burned outside the camp (<a href="/leviticus/16-27.htm">Leviticus 16:27</a>). Jesus' suffering outside the city gate symbolizes His role as the ultimate sin offering, bearing the sins of the people. The location also emphasizes His rejection by the religious leaders and the people of Jerusalem, paralleling the scapegoat in <a href="/leviticus/16-10.htm">Leviticus 16:10</a>, which was sent away into the wilderness. Historically, crucifixions were carried out outside city limits to maintain ceremonial cleanliness within the city and to serve as a public deterrent. This act of suffering outside the gate also connects to the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as "despised and rejected by men."<p><b>to sanctify the people</b><br>The purpose of Jesus' suffering is to sanctify, or make holy, the people. In the Old Testament, sanctification was achieved through the sacrificial system, which involved the shedding of animal blood to atone for sins (<a href="/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36-37</a>). Jesus' sacrifice, however, is once and for all, providing a complete and perfect sanctification for those who believe in Him (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). This sanctification is not just a ceremonial cleansing but a spiritual transformation, setting believers apart for God's purposes. The concept of sanctification is deeply rooted in the covenant relationship between God and His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>, where Israel is called to be a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation."<p><b>by His own blood</b><br>The phrase underscores the means by which sanctification is achieved&#8212;through the blood of Jesus. In the biblical context, blood represents life and is essential for atonement (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). Jesus' blood is the fulfillment of the Old Testament sacrifices, which were a shadow of the true sacrifice to come (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>). His blood signifies the new covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises to write His law on the hearts of His people and forgive their iniquities. The shedding of Jesus' blood is central to the Christian faith, as it provides redemption, reconciliation, and access to God (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>).
