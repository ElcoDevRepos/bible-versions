His faith is highlighted as a key aspect of his character. Faith, in this context, refers to a deep trust in God and His promises. Moses' faith is significant because it demonstrates reliance on God rather than on earthly power or status. This aligns with <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which defines faith as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.<p><b>when he was grown</b><br>This phrase indicates a period of maturity and decision-making in Moses' life. According to <a href="/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a>, Moses was about 40 years old when he made the decision to leave the Egyptian royal court. This suggests a deliberate and conscious choice, rather than a youthful impulse. His upbringing in Pharaoh's household would have provided him with education and privilege, yet he chose a different path.<p><b>refused to be called the son of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter</b><br>Moses' refusal to be identified as the son of Pharaoh's daughter signifies a rejection of Egyptian identity and privilege. This decision is culturally and historically significant, as being part of the royal family would have afforded him immense power and wealth. His choice reflects a prioritization of his Hebrew identity and God's calling over temporal benefits. This act of refusal can be seen as a type of Christ, who also rejected earthly power and status for the sake of fulfilling God's plan (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>). Moses' decision is a pivotal moment that sets the stage for his role as a leader and deliverer of Israel, prefiguring the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.

The words here used are taken from the Greek translation of <a href="/exodus/2-11.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brothers.">Exodus 2:11</a>, where we first read of Moses as openly Associating himself with his oppressed people. When Moses slew the Egyptian who was "smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren," he in act "refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter," and chose "to suffer Affliction with the people of God." (See <a href="/exodus/2-15.htm" title="Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelled in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.">Exodus 2:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in</span> (or, <span class="accented">of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Egypt; for he had respect unto</span> (literally, <span class="accented">looked away to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the recompense of reward.</span> As in the speech of Stephen (<a href="/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>.), so here, the narrative in Exodus is supplemented from tradition, such as is found also in Philo. Moses' refusal to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his renunciation of his position in the court in order to associate himself with his oppressed fellow-countrymen, is not mentioned in the original history, though it is consistent with it, and indeed implied. St. Stephen further regards his taking the part of the Israelite against the Egyptian (<a href="/exodus/2-11.htm">Exodus 2:11-13</a>) as a sign that he was already conscious of his mission, and hoped even then to rouse his countrymen to make a struggle for freedom. The reproach he subjected himself to by thus preferring the patriot's to the courtier's life is here called "the reproach of Christ." How so? Chrysostom takes the expression to mean only the same kind of reproach as Christ was afterwards subjected to, in respect of his being scorned, and his Divine mission disbelieved, by those whom he came to save. But, if the expression had been used with respect to Christian's suffering for the faith (as it is below, <a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>), it would certainly imply more than this; viz. a participation in Christ's own reproach, not merely a reproach like his. (Cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-5.htm">2 Corinthians 1:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, and <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, where there is the further idea expressed of Christ himself suffering in his members.) And such being the idea which the phrase in itself would at once convey to Christian readers, and especially as the very same is used below (<a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>) with reference to Christians, it must surely be somehow involved in this passage. But how so, we ask again, in the case of Moses? To get at the idea of the phrase we must bear in mind the view of the Old and New Testaments being but two parts of one Divine dispensation. The Exodus was thus not only typical of the deliverance through Christ, but also a step towards it, a preparation for it, a link in the divinely ordered chain of events leading up to the great redemption. Hence, in the first place, the reproach endured by Moses in furtherance of the Exodus may be regarded as endured at any rate <span class="accented">for the sake of</span> Christ, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in his cause whose coming was the end and purpose of the whole dispensation. And further, inasmuch as Christ is elsewhere spoken of as the Head of the whole mystical body of his people in all ages - all to be gathered together at last in him - he may be regarded, even before his incarnation, as himself reproached in the reproach of his servant Moses. Compare the view, presented in <a href="/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3</a>, of the Son being Lord of the "house" in which Moses was a servant, and the comprehensive sense of "God's house" implied in that passage. Nor should we leave out of consideration the identification, maintained by the Fathers generally (see Bull, 'Def. Fid. Nic.,' I. 1.), of the Angel of the Pentateuch, of him who revealed himself to Moses as I AM from the bush, with the Second Person of the holy Trinity, the Word who became incarnate in Christ. (Cf. <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-15</a>; also <a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>, read in connection with <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>; and <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, where the spiritual rock that followed the children of Israel in the wilderness is said to have been Christ.) Whatever, however, be the exact import of the expression, "reproach of Christ," in its application to Moses, it is evidently selected here with the view of bringing his example home to the readers of the Epistle, by thus intimating that his faith's trial was essentially the same as theirs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/11-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">By faith</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Pistei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4102.htm">Strong's 4102: </a> </span><span class="str2">Faith, belief, trust, confidence; fidelity, faithfulness. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#969;&#971;&#963;&#8134;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(M&#333;us&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3475.htm">Strong's 3475: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or Moses, or Mouses of Hebrew origin; Moseus, Moses, or Mouses, the Hebrew lawgiver.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when he was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(genomenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">grown,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#941;&#947;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(megas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3173.htm">Strong's 3173: </a> </span><span class="str2">Large, great, in the widest sense. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">refused</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7968;&#961;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;rn&#275;sato)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_720.htm">Strong's 720: </a> </span><span class="str2">Perhaps from a and the middle voice of rheo; to contradict, i.e. Disavow, reject, abnegate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to be called</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(legesthai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Infinitive Middle or Passive<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] son</span><br /><span class="grk">&#965;&#7985;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(huios)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5207.htm">Strong's 5207: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son, descendent.
