The context is the inadequacy of the Old Covenant, which was based on the Law given through Moses. The fault was not with the Law itself, which is holy and good, but with the people's inability to uphold it. This reflects the human condition of sinfulness and the need for a savior. The Old Testament frequently records Israel's disobedience and idolatry, leading to God's judgment and the need for a new covenant.<p><b>&#8220;Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord,</b><br>This phrase introduces a prophetic announcement, indicating a future event. It is a common prophetic formula used in the Old Testament to signal God's intervention in history. The phrase suggests an eschatological hope, pointing to a time when God will act decisively to fulfill His promises. This is a direct quotation from <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, highlighting the continuity of God's plan from the Old to the New Testament.<p><b>when I will make a new covenant</b><br>The concept of a "new covenant" is central to the New Testament and the Christian faith. It signifies a departure from the Old Covenant, which was based on the Law, to a new relationship based on grace through faith in Jesus Christ. This new covenant is characterized by internal transformation and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, as opposed to the external adherence to the Law. It fulfills the promises made to Abraham and is inaugurated through the death and resurrection of Jesus.<p><b>with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the inclusivity of the new covenant, extending to both the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah). Historically, the division of the kingdom occurred after Solomon's reign, leading to separate identities. The promise of a new covenant signifies the reunification and restoration of God's people. In the New Testament, this is expanded to include Gentiles, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>, where Paul speaks of the inclusion of the Gentiles into the promises made to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine author of the new covenant, who finds fault with the people under the old covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, specifically the house of Israel and the house of Judah, who were unable to uphold the old covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_covenant.htm">The New Covenant</a></b><br>A promise of a renewed relationship between God and His people, distinct from the old covenant given at Sinai.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_israel_and_the_house_of_judah.htm">The House of Israel and the House of Judah</a></b><br>The divided kingdoms of Israel, representing the entirety of God's chosen people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophet_jeremiah.htm">The Prophet Jeremiah</a></b><br>The original source of the prophecy quoted in <a href="/hebrews/8-8.htm">Hebrews 8:8</a>, found in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_need_for_a_new_covenant.htm">The Need for a New Covenant</a></b><br>The old covenant was insufficient due to human inability to uphold it.

The evidence of such withdrawal immediately before the prophet's view may be supposed to have been the Babylonian captivity. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The distinguishing characteristics of the new covenant are  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/8-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[But]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
