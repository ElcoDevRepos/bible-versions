In the context of Hebrews, Jesus is presented as the ultimate High Priest. Unlike the Levitical priests, who were often seen as distant and unable to fully understand the struggles of the people, Jesus is portrayed as one who can sympathize with human frailty. This is significant because it emphasizes His humanity and His ability to relate to the human condition. The Greek word for "sympathize" (sympatheo) implies a deep, compassionate understanding, suggesting that Jesus shares in our experiences and emotions.<p><b>but we have one who was tempted in every way that we are</b><br>This phrase underscores the completeness of Jesus' human experience. The Gospels record instances of Jesus being tempted, most notably in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>, <a href="/luke/4.htm">Luke 4:1-13</a>). These temptations were real and comprehensive, covering physical needs, pride, and power. The phrase "in every way" suggests that Jesus faced the full spectrum of human temptation, making Him fully equipped to understand and aid those who are tempted. This also fulfills the typology of Jesus as the second Adam, who, unlike the first Adam, resisted temptation and remained obedient to God.<p><b>yet was without sin</b><br>Despite facing every form of temptation, Jesus remained sinless. This is a critical aspect of His role as the perfect High Priest and the spotless Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). His sinlessness is essential for His sacrificial death to be effective for atonement. The sinlessness of Jesus is affirmed throughout the New Testament (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22, 1</a> <a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>).

Because He sympathizes fully and intercedes flawlessly, we can draw near to Him with boldness, trusting both His compassion and His power to help us stand firm.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) We cannot but note again how the power of the exhortation (especially to those immediately addressed) lay in the combination of the two thoughts--the greatness and the tender compassion of the High Priest of our confession. The two are united in the words of <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm" title="Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.">Hebrews 4:16</a>, "the <span class= "ital">throne</span> of <span class= "ital">grace.</span>" (Comp. <a href="/hebrews/8-1.htm" title="Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;">Hebrews 8:1</a>.) The beautiful rendering, "touched with the feeling of our infirmities," is due to the Genevan Testament of 1557.<p><span class= "bld">But was in all points . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">but One that hath in all points been tempted in like manner, apart from sin.</span> These words show the nature and the limits of this sympathy of Christ. He suffers with His people, not merely showing compassion to those who are suffering and tempted, but taking to Himself a joint feeling of their weaknesses. He can do this because He has passed through trial, has Himself been tempted. In speaking of "weaknesses" the writer uses a word applicable both to the people and to their Lord, who was "crucified through weakness" (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.">2Corinthians 13:4</a>). Its meaning must not be limited to the region of pain and bodily suffering: whatever belongs to the necessary limitations of that human nature which He assumed is included. As He learned His obedience from sufferings (<a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a>), He gained His knowledge of the help we need in that "Himself took our weaknesses" (<a href="/matthew/8-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.">Matthew 8:17</a>), and was Himself tempted in like manner, save that in Him sin had no place (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>). These last words supply the limit to the thought of weakness and temptation as applied to our High Priest. Not only was the temptation fruitless in <span class= "ital">leading to</span> sin (this is implied here, but only as a part or a result of another truth), but in the widest sense He could say, "The prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in Me" (<a href="/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>). "Was tempted in all points in like manner," are words which must not be over-pressed; but the essential principles of temptation may be traced in those with which Jesus was assailed. (Comp. <a href="/john/21-25.htm" title="And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.">John 21:25</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all things tempted like as we are, without sin</span>.

The latter part of the verse corresponds in meaning with <a href="/hebrews/2-18.htm">Hebrews 2:18</a>, but with further delineation of the temptation undergone by Christ. The concluding <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (best taken in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, which it immediately follows, rather than with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) is not a categorical assertion of Christ's sinlessness, though it implies it, but an exclusion of the idea of sin from-the likeness spoken cf. His temptation was after the likeness of ours, "apart from sin," or "sin except." For similar expressions, though not with definite reference to temptation, cf. <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>. But how is the exception of sin to be understood? Is it that, though, like us, tempted, he, unlike us, resisted temptation? Or is it that his sinless nature was incapable of being even solicited by sin? Now, the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means sometimes "to tempt to sin," as Satan or our own lusts tempt us (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>; <a href="/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13</a>, etc.); and also "to prove.... to try," "to test faithfulness," as in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>, etc., in which sense, with reference especially to afflictive trials, the noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is commonly used (cf. <a href="/luke/8-13.htm">Luke 8:13</a>; <a href="/luke/22-18.htm">Luke 22:18</a>; <a href="/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-14.htm">Galatians 4:14</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>; <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>). That Christ was not only subjected to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in this latter sense, but was also directly assailed by the tempter to sin (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), appears from the Gospel record. But here comes in a difficulty. There can, we conceive, be no real temptation where there is no liability to the sin suggested by temptation, still less where there is no possibility of sinning. But can we imagine any such liability, or even possibility, in the case of the Divine and Sinless One? If not, wherein did the temptation consist? How could it be at all like ours, or one through his own experience of which he can sympathize with us? It was for maintaining, on the strength of such considerations, the theoretic peccability of Christ, that Irving was expelled as heretical flora the Presbyterian communion. The question has undoubtedly its serious difficulties in common with the whole subjeer of the Divine and human in Christ. The following thoughts may, however, aid solution. That Christ, in his human nature, partook of all the original affections of humanity - hope, fear, desire, joy, grief, indignation, shrinking from suffering, and the like - is apparent, not only from his life, but also from the fact that his assumption of our humanity would have otherwise been incomplete. Such affections are not in themselves sinful; they only are so when, under temptation, any of them become inordinate, and serve as motives to transgression of duty. He, in virtue of his Divine personality, could not through them be seduced into sin; but it does not follow that he could not, in his human nature, feel their power to seduce, or rather the power of the tempter to seduce through them, and thus have personal experience of man's temptation. St. John says of one" born of God" that he "doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him, and he <span class="accented">cannot</span> sin, because he is born of God" (<a href="/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>). He does not mean that the regenerate Christian is not exposed to and does not feel, the power of temptation; only that, so far forth as he lives in the new life from God, he is proof against it; he gives no internal assent to the seduction of the tempter; and so "that wicked one toucheth him net" (ver. 18). What is thus said of one "born of God" may be said much more, and without any qualification, of the Son of God, without denying that he too experienced the power of temptation, though altogether proof against it. Bengel says, "Quomodo autem, <span class="accented">sine pectate</span> tentatus, compati potest tentatis <span class="accented">cum peceato?</span> In intellectu multo acrius anima salvatoris percepit imagines tentantes quam nos infirmi: in voluntato tam celeriter incursum earum retudit quam ignis aquae guttulam sibi objectam. Expertus est igitur qua virtute sit opus ad tentationes vincendas. Compati potest nam et sine peccato, et tamen vere est tentatus." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/4-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
