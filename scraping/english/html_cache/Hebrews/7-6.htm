He is described as the king of Salem and a priest of God Most High. Unlike the Levitical priests, who were descendants of Levi, Melchizedek's priesthood is not based on genealogy. This highlights the uniqueness of his priesthood, which is a type of Christ's eternal priesthood. <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a> prophesies about a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek, pointing to Jesus, who is not a descendant of Levi but of Judah.<p><b>collected a tenth from Abraham</b><br>The act of collecting a tenth, or tithe, from Abraham signifies Melchizedek's authority and superiority. In ancient Near Eastern culture, paying a tithe was a sign of respect and acknowledgment of authority. Abraham, the patriarch of Israel, recognized Melchizedek's priestly role and honored him with a tithe. This prefigures the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the high priest who is greater than the Levitical priesthood.<p><b>and blessed him who had the promises</b><br>Melchizedek's blessing of Abraham is significant because it underscores the greater blessing coming from the greater to the lesser. Abraham, who had received promises from God (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>), is blessed by Melchizedek, indicating Melchizedek's superior spiritual status. This act foreshadows the blessings believers receive through Christ, who is the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham. The blessing also emphasizes the eternal nature of Christ's priesthood, which surpasses the temporary and genealogical limitations of the Levitical priesthood.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/melchizedek.htm">Melchizedek</a></b><br>A mysterious figure in the Bible, Melchizedek is both a king and a priest. He is significant because he is not from the Levitical priesthood, yet he receives tithes from Abraham and blesses him, indicating a higher spiritual authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, Abraham is a central figure in the Bible. He is known for his faith and obedience to God. In this passage, he is the one who gives a tenth to Melchizedek and receives a blessing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/levi.htm">Levi</a></b><br>The tribe of Levi is traditionally associated with the priesthood in Israel. The Levitical priests were descendants of Levi, one of the twelve sons of Jacob. The passage highlights that Melchizedek's priesthood is distinct from the Levitical line.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tithing.htm">Tithing</a></b><br>The act of giving a tenth of one's income or produce, which is a practice rooted in the Old Testament. Abraham's giving of a tenth to Melchizedek is significant as it predates the Mosaic Law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/blessing.htm">Blessing</a></b><br>In biblical terms, a blessing is a pronouncement of favor or well-being. Melchizedek's blessing of Abraham underscores his spiritual authority and the divine favor upon Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_superiority_of_melchizedek's_priesthood.htm">The Superiority of Melchizedek's Priesthood</a></b><br>Melchizedek's priesthood is superior to the Levitical priesthood because it is not based on lineage but on divine appointment.

His unique dual role&#8212;both king and priest&#8212;foreshadows Christ, who perfectly unites those offices (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who did not trace his descent from Levi</b><p>Levi, Jacob&#8217;s son, was ancestor of Israel&#8217;s priestly tribe (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5&#8211;10</a>).
