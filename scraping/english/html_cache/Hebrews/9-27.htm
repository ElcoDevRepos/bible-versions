In biblical context, death entered the world through Adam's sin (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>; <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). The concept of dying once contrasts with certain beliefs in reincarnation, affirming the finality of physical death. The appointment to die once underscores God's sovereign plan and the natural order established since the fall of man. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that life is temporary and that humans are mortal beings (<a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:2</a>).<p><b>and after that to face judgment</b><br>This phrase introduces the certainty of divine judgment following death. It reflects the biblical teaching that all individuals will be held accountable for their lives (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>). The judgment is depicted as a singular event, reinforcing the finality of one's earthly life and the absence of a second chance post-mortem. This judgment is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, who spoke of a final judgment where the righteous and the wicked are separated (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>). The concept of judgment after death is a call to live a life of faith and obedience, knowing that earthly actions have eternal consequences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

Man does not return to die a second time. That some few have twice passed through death does not affect the general law. The emphatic word "once" and the special design of the verse are explained by the words which follow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27, 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this judgment: so the Christ also, once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, without sin, to them that look for him, unto salvation.</span> The Divine ordinance concerning mankind in general has its analogy in the truth concerning Christ, who was made like unto us in all things, and who represents humanity.

The ideas of <span class="accented">bearing</span> and of <span class="accented">taking away</span> may thus be both implied. In contrast with this is the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> ("without, or apart from, sin") when he shall appear again. For then he will have been, as he is now, removed from it altogether - from its burden and its surroundings; it is in glory only that he will then appear. And so also "to them that look for him" his appearing will be "unto salvation" only. They, too, will have done with sin. The insertion of the words, "to them that look for him," precludes the conclusion that it will be so to all.
