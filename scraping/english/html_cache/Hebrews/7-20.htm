In biblical context, an oath is a solemn promise made by God, underscoring the unchangeable nature of His will. The reference here is to <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, where God swears an oath that the Messiah will be a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek. This contrasts with the Levitical priesthood, which was established by the Law without an oath. The use of an oath highlights the superiority and permanence of Christ's priesthood, as God's promises are irrevocable and eternal.<p><b>For others became priests without an oath,</b><br>This phrase refers to the Levitical priests who were appointed based on lineage and the Law of Moses, not by a divine oath. The Levitical priesthood was hereditary, passed down through the tribe of Levi, specifically the descendants of Aaron. This system was temporary and imperfect, as it required continual sacrifices and was subject to human mortality and sin. The absence of an oath in their appointment signifies the provisional nature of their priesthood. In contrast, Jesus' priesthood, confirmed by God's oath, is eternal and perfect, fulfilling the prophetic anticipation of a new and better covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/melchizedek.htm">Melchizedek</a></b><br>A priest-king of Salem who is a type of Christ, representing a priesthood that is eternal and superior to the Levitical priesthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levitical_priesthood.htm">Levitical Priesthood</a></b><br>The priesthood established under the Law of Moses, where priests were appointed based on lineage rather than an oath.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The ultimate High Priest, whose priesthood is established by God's oath, signifying its eternal and unchangeable nature.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_oath.htm">God's Oath</a></b><br>A solemn promise made by God, emphasizing the certainty and permanence of Jesus' priesthood.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrews.htm">Hebrews</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, likely Jewish Christians who were familiar with the Old Testament and the Levitical priesthood.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_god's_oath.htm">The Significance of God's Oath</a></b><br>God's oath underscores the certainty and permanence of Jesus' priesthood, contrasting it with the temporary and hereditary nature of the Levitical priesthood.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_superiority_of_christ's_priesthood.htm">The Superiority of Christ's Priesthood</a></b><br>Jesus' priesthood is superior because it is based on God's unchangeable promise, offering believers a secure and eternal intercession.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_salvation.htm">The Assurance of Salvation</a></b><br>Believers can have confidence in their salvation because it is secured by Jesus, whose priesthood is guaranteed by God's oath.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">The Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' priesthood fulfills Old Testament prophecy, demonstrating the continuity and reliability of God's redemptive plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_light_of_christ's_priesthood.htm">Living in Light of Christ's Priesthood</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to live with the assurance and hope that comes from knowing our High Priest intercedes for us eternally.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_7_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 7:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_7_20_God_s_oath_in_priesthood.htm">How does Hebrews 7:20 emphasize the importance of God's oath in priesthood?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_God_s_oath_key_to_Jesus_priesthood.htm">Why is God's oath significant for understanding Jesus' eternal priesthood in Hebrews 7:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_7_20_and_Psalm_110_4_link.htm">How does Hebrews 7:20 connect to Psalm 110:4 regarding priesthood?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Jesus_priesthood_affect_daily_faith.htm">What practical implications does Jesus' priesthood have for our daily faith journey?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_God_s_oath_in_spiritual_life.htm">How can we apply the assurance of God's oath in our spiritual lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_7_20_Oaths_role_in_Jesus_priesthood.htm">How does Hebrews 7:20 emphasize the importance of oaths in the priesthood of Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_the_oath_key_in_Hebrews_7_20.htm">Why is the oath significant in establishing Jesus as a superior priest in Hebrews 7:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Historical_basis_for_oaths_in_Hebrews_7_20.htm">What historical context supports the use of oaths in Hebrews 7:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_hebrews_7.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Hebrews 7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/where's_proof_god_named_jesus_priest.htm">In Hebrews 5:5, where is the historical evidence for God directly declaring Jesus as priest in a manner consistent with Israel&#8217;s established priesthood?
