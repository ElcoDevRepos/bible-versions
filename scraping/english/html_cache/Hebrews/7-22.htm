This oath is rooted in <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, where God declares, "You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek." This divine promise underscores the eternal and unchangeable nature of Jesus' priesthood, contrasting with the Levitical priesthood, which was based on lineage and not on an oath. The concept of an oath in biblical times was a solemn and binding commitment, often invoking God's name as a witness, making it irrevocable and trustworthy.<p><b>Jesus has become</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the active role of Jesus in fulfilling the divine promise. Unlike the Levitical priests who were appointed by the law, Jesus' priesthood is established by God's direct intervention and promise. The use of "has become" indicates a completed action with ongoing significance, highlighting the transition from the old covenant to the new covenant through Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. This transformation is central to the message of Hebrews, which presents Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>the guarantee</b><br>In the ancient world, a guarantee was a pledge or assurance of fulfillment. Jesus as the "guarantee" signifies that He is the surety or assurance of the new covenant's promises. This role is unique to Jesus, as He not only mediates the covenant but also ensures its effectiveness and permanence. The concept of a guarantee in this context implies a legal and binding assurance, reflecting the certainty and reliability of the new covenant established through Christ.<p><b>of a better covenant</b><br>The "better covenant" refers to the new covenant prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, which promises a more intimate relationship between God and His people, characterized by internal transformation and forgiveness of sins. This covenant is superior to the old Mosaic covenant, which was based on external laws and rituals. The new covenant, established through Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection, offers a direct and personal relationship with God, fulfilling the law's requirements and providing eternal redemption. This superiority is a key theme in Hebrews, which contrasts the limitations of the old covenant with the perfection and completeness of the new covenant in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, regarded as the Son of God and the mediator of the new covenant.

As the priest whose appointment is confirmed by the oath of God is raised above all former priests, in the same proportion is the covenant of which Jesus is surety higher, better, than the former covenant. For the "better hope" of <a href="/hebrews/7-19.htm" title="For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw near to God.">Hebrews 7:19</a> we now read "better covenant"; the new idea is not different in substance, but is more definite and clear. The very promise of the "other priest" brought with it a "better hope"; the recollection of the divine oath is fitly succeeded by the mention of a "covenant."<p>This is the first occurrence in this Epistle of a very interesting word (<span class= "ital">diath?k</span>?) which hereafter will occupy an important place in the argument. Throughout the Greek translation of the Old Testament it is used to represent a Hebrew word which is (more than 200 times) rightly rendered <span class= "ital">covenant</span> in our version; and, like the Hebrew word, it is applied both to mutual agreements between man and man, and to "covenants" or engagements into which God enters in regard <span class= "ital">to</span> man. In classical writers <span class= "ital">diath?k?</span> commonly denotes a <span class= "ital">testament;</span> and hence in the old Latin translation of the Scriptures <span class= "ital">testamentum</span> became the common rendering of the word. As, however, this rendering is very often found where it is impossible to think of such a meaning as <span class= "ital">will</span> (for example, in <a href="/psalms/83-5.htm" title="For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against you:">Psalm 83:5</a>, where no one will suppose the Psalmist to say that the enemies of God "have arranged a <span class= "ital">testament</span> against Him"), it is plain that the Latin <span class= "ital">testamentum</span> was used with an extended meaning, answering to the wide application of the Greek word. St. Paul's designation of the Jewish Scriptures as "the Old Covenant" (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm" title="But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same veil not taken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is done away in Christ.">2Corinthians 3:14</a>) thus became familiarly known as <span class= "ital">The Old Testament.</span> In the New Testament the Authorised version more commonly presents the better rendering; but, through the influence of the Latin, <span class= "ital">testament</span> is retained in several places--viz., in the various accounts of the institution of the Lord's Supper; in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2Corinthians 3:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm" title="But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same veil not taken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is done away in Christ.">2Corinthians 3:14</a>; in <a href="/revelation/11-19.htm" title="And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightning, and voices, and thunder, and an earthquake, and great hail.">Revelation 11:19</a> ("the ark of His testament," a very strange translation); in the present verse; and especially in the very important passage, <a href="/context/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15-20</a>. There is a very general agreement of opinion that "covenant" must be the true meaning in all passages of the New Testament except the one last mentioned; and even in that place there are strong reasons for retaining the same rendering. (See the Note on <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>.) In this verse, at all events, we cannot doubt that the writer is thinking of a covenant. (See <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-8.htm" title="For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, said the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:">Hebrews 8:8</a>.) Here only is Jesus spoken of as Surety, elsewhere as Mediator (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>). As through the Son of Man the covenant becomes established, so in Him it remains secure; the words addressed by God to Him as Priest and King contain the pledge of its validity and permanence. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/7-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Because of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Kata)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2596.htm">Strong's 2596: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; down, in varied relations (genitive, dative or accusative) with which it is joined).</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(tosouto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5118.htm">Strong's 5118: </a> </span><span class="str2">So great, so large, so long, so many.
