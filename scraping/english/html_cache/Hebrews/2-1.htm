The author of Hebrews is urging believers to be diligent in their spiritual lives. This call to attention is reminiscent of the Old Testament warnings to Israel to heed God's commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>). The use of "must" indicates an imperative, underscoring the seriousness of the message. In the context of Hebrews, this is a call to focus on the teachings of Jesus Christ, who is superior to angels and prophets.<p><b>therefore,</b><br>The word "therefore" connects this verse to the preceding chapter, where the supremacy of Christ is established. It serves as a logical conclusion drawn from the argument that Jesus is greater than the angels and has delivered a message of salvation. This connection highlights the importance of the message of Christ, as it is the culmination of God's revelation to humanity.<p><b>to what we have heard,</b><br>This refers to the gospel message that the early Christians received. The phrase suggests an oral tradition, as the early church relied heavily on the spoken word before the New Testament was fully compiled. The message they heard was about the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, which was preached by the apostles. This aligns with <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, which states that faith comes from hearing the message of Christ.<p><b>so that we do not drift away.</b><br>The imagery of drifting suggests a gradual and almost imperceptible movement away from the truth. This nautical metaphor would have been familiar to the original audience, many of whom lived in a maritime culture. Drifting implies a lack of anchor or direction, warning believers of the danger of neglecting their faith. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_timothy/1-19.htm">1 Timothy 1:19</a>, where Paul warns against shipwrecking one's faith. The warning is clear: without careful attention, believers risk losing their spiritual moorings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

Do not lose sight of them; keep them within your heart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus voiced the same priority: &#8220;Pay careful attention to how you listen&#8221; (<a href="/luke/8-18.htm">Luke 8:18</a>). Careful listening is the first step to faithful living.<p>&#8226; Practical steps:<p>&#8211; Schedule regular, unhurried time in Scripture.<p>&#8211; Turn off distractions and read aloud to engage ears and eyes.<p>&#8211; Take notes, underline, and rehearse key truths throughout the day.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>therefore</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Therefore&#8221; connects to <a href="/bsb/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1</a>, where the Son is shown to be higher than angels, Creator, Sustainer, and enthroned King. Because His word is infinitely superior, our obligation to heed it is also intensified.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2-3</a> reminds us: &#8220;In these last days He has spoken to us by His Son&#8230; sustaining all things by His powerful word.&#8221; If the Speaker is supreme, ignoring His word is perilous.<p>&#8226; The pattern appears elsewhere: after displaying Christ&#8217;s majesty, the apostles press believers toward obedience (see <a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-5</a>). Revelation always calls for response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to what we have heard</b><p>&#8226; The focus is the gospel message &#8220;first spoken by the Lord&#8221; and &#8220;confirmed to us by those who heard Him&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Hearing is central to saving faith: &#8220;Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226; John, an eyewitness, wrote so that &#8220;you also may have fellowship with us; and our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Guard against adding or subtracting from what has been heard.

No violent storm is necessary; simple neglect is enough.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a> broadens the warning: &#8220;See to it, brothers, that none of you has a wicked heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a> adds, &#8220;Then we will no longer be infants, tossed about by the waves and carried around by every wind of teaching.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Anchoring practices:<p>&#8211; Stay in fellowship where brothers and sisters can speak truth in love (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>).<p>&#8211; Memorize and meditate on Scripture; God&#8217;s word is the sure anchor (<a href="/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>).<p>&#8211; Respond immediately to conviction; delayed obedience opens the door to drift.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a> calls believers to an attentive, earnest engagement with the gospel message. Because the Son who speaks is glorious beyond measure, we must listen carefully, continually rehearse what we have heard, and let it govern our lives. This deliberate attentiveness guards us from the quiet but deadly danger of spiritual drift. Staying moored to the unchanging Word keeps us steadfast, fruitful, and ready for the day we meet the Lord face-to-face.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>II.</span><p>(1-4) These verses must be closely joined with the first chapter.
