In biblical context, the law given to Moses was a guide and a tutor (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>) leading to Christ. The "good things to come" refers to the new covenant and the salvation brought through Jesus Christ. The law's rituals and sacrifices pointed forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who fulfilled the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). This concept of shadow versus reality is also seen in <a href="/colossians/2-17.htm">Colossians 2:17</a>, where Paul describes religious festivals as a shadow of things to come, with the substance belonging to Christ.<p><b>not the realities themselves</b><br>The "realities" are the fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus. The law's sacrifices were temporary and symbolic, unable to provide true redemption or a clear conscience (<a href="/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>). The reality is found in Christ's once-for-all sacrifice, which provides complete atonement and access to God (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>). This distinction emphasizes the superiority of the new covenant over the old.<p><b>It can never, by the same sacrifices offered year after year</b><br>The repetitive nature of the sacrifices under the Mosaic law highlights their insufficiency. The Day of Atonement, observed annually, involved sacrifices that could not permanently remove sin (Leviticus 16). This repetition underscored the need for a better sacrifice, which is fulfilled in Christ's death (<a href="/hebrews/9-25.htm">Hebrews 9:25-26</a>). The phrase "year after year" emphasizes the temporary and incomplete nature of these sacrifices.<p><b>make perfect those who draw near to worship</b><br>"Make perfect" refers to achieving a state of spiritual completeness and purity before God. The law's sacrifices could not cleanse the conscience or provide lasting righteousness (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>). In contrast, Christ's sacrifice perfects believers by granting them righteousness and sanctification (<a href="/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>). "Those who draw near to worship" indicates the worshipers seeking fellowship with God, which is fully realized through Christ, who provides direct access to the Father (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law given to the Israelites, which includes ceremonial, moral, and civil laws.

The word "image" is indeed consistent with the very closest and most perfect likeness; but why is the contrast to "shadow" expressed by a word which cannot denote more than likeness, and not by a reference to the things themselves? The answer would seem to be that, from the very nature of the "good things to come," the law could not be conceived of as having the things themselves; but had it possessed "the very image" of them, a representation so perfect might have been found to bring with it equal efficacy.<p><span class= "bld">Can never with those sacrifices.</span>--It is difficult to ascertain the exact Greek text in the latter half of this verse. With the ordinary reading the general construction of the sentence is that which the Authorised version represents, "For the law . . . can never . . . make perfect." The better MSS., however, read "they can," a change which introduces some irregularity of construction: the pronoun "they" must probably in this case be understood of the priests. The order of the Greek is also very peculiar. Two translations of the verse (with the changed reading) may be given: (1) "They can never with the same sacrifices year by year which they offer continually make them that draw nigh perfect." (2) "They can never year by year, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually, make them that draw nigh perfect." The difference between the two renderings will be easily seen. The former makes the whole sentence to relate to the annual sacrifice on the Day of Atonement, and gives to "continually" almost the same meaning as "year by year." The meaning of the latter is that by the annual sacrifices, which are the same as those which the priests are offering for the people day by day (for the sacrifice of the Day of Atonement did not <span class= "ital">in itself</span> differ from the ordinary sin offering), they cannot make the worshippers perfect. The latter translation agrees best with the original, and conveys a very striking thought. <span class= "ital">It</span> is open, however, to a very serious objection--that it separates the verse into two incongruous parts. That annual sacrifices not different in kind from the sin offerings which were presented day by day (and which the very institution of the Day of Atonement declared to be imperfect) could not bring to the worshippers what they needed, is an important argument; but it has no connection with the first words of the verse. Hence, though the Greek does not very readily yield the former translation, it is probably to be preferred. With the expression "them that draw nigh" or "approach" (to God) comp. <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>, where the same word is used.
