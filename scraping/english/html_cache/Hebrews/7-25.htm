The Greek word translated as "completely" can also mean "forever," indicating both the eternal and all-encompassing nature of salvation through Jesus. This reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about a Messiah who would provide a perfect and everlasting salvation, unlike the temporary atonement offered by the Levitical priesthood (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>). The concept of complete salvation is rooted in the understanding that Jesus' sacrifice was once for all (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>), contrasting with the repeated sacrifices of the Old Covenant.<p><b>those who draw near to God through Him</b><br>This phrase highlights the exclusivity of access to God through Jesus Christ. In the Old Testament, the high priest was the mediator between God and the people, entering the Holy of Holies once a year (Leviticus 16). Jesus, as the ultimate High Priest, provides a new and living way to approach God (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>). This access is not limited to a specific time or place but is available to all who believe in Him. The phrase also underscores the necessity of faith and relationship, as drawing near to God requires a personal response to His invitation through Christ (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p><b>since He always lives to intercede for them</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the ongoing priestly role of Jesus. Unlike the Levitical priests who were mortal and needed successors, Jesus' priesthood is eternal (<a href="/hebrews/7-23.htm">Hebrews 7:23-24</a>). His intercession is a continuous advocacy on behalf of believers, ensuring their standing before God. This intercessory role is a fulfillment of the Messianic prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, where the Messiah is declared a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek. Jesus' intercession is not only a reminder of His sacrificial death but also of His resurrection and ascension, affirming His victory over sin and death and His authority to mediate on behalf of humanity (<a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jesus is portrayed as the eternal High Priest who intercedes for believers.

In His supplication unto God, "who was able to save Him out of death," He was heard; this was the type--and more than the type (see the Note on <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;">Hebrews 5:7</a>)--of the eternal salvation of which He, when made perfect, becomes the Author. The connecting link between the priestly office and "salvation" appears, therefore, to be the prevalent intercession of which this verse speaks--an intercession which implies all that has preceded in His priestly ministration. (See <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That come unto God by him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">that approach through Him to God.</span> See <a href="/context/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>, where full expression is given to the thought here briefly indicated.

Here it is the perpetual intercession of Christ before the heavenly mercy-seat. In the view of his office thus arrived at there is, in fact, a transition to the main subject set forth in the three chapters that follow; viz. the fulfillment in Christ of the ceremonial of the Law, and especially of the high priest's intercession on the Day of Atonement. And thus from Melchizedek the train of thought passes to the high priest. The type of the former has been sufficiently shown to be fulfilled in the <span class="accented">higher order</span> of Christ's priesthood; it is now to be shown how, being of such higher order, it is the antitype of the Aaronic priesthood too, accomplishing what it signified.
