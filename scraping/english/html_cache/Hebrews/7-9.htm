The author of Hebrews often uses rhetorical devices to make theological points, emphasizing the superiority of Christ's priesthood. This phrase signals that the following statement is not literal but serves to illustrate a deeper truth about the relationship between the Levitical priesthood and the priesthood of Melchizedek.<p><b>Levi, who collects the tenth</b><br>Levi refers to the tribe of Levi, specifically the Levitical priests who were responsible for collecting tithes from the Israelites as commanded in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>). The Levites were set apart for religious duties and did not receive a land inheritance like the other tribes, relying instead on the tithes for their sustenance. This system underscores the importance of the priestly role in Israelite society and worship.<p><b>paid the tenth through Abraham</b><br>This statement refers to the event in <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>, where Abraham gives a tenth of the spoils of war to Melchizedek, the king of Salem and priest of God Most High. Theologically, this act is significant because it suggests that the Levitical priesthood, represented by Levi, was subordinate to Melchizedek's priesthood. Since Levi was a descendant of Abraham, the author argues that Levi, in a sense, participated in Abraham's act of giving a tithe to Melchizedek. This prefigures the superiority of Christ's priesthood, which is in the order of Melchizedek, over the Levitical priesthood.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levi.htm">Levi</a></b><br>Levi is one of the twelve sons of Jacob and the ancestor of the Levitical priesthood.

This proves the superiority of Christ&#8217;s Melchizedek-like priesthood over the Levitical system and affirms that the New Covenant supersedes the Old without undermining its divine origin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">And as I may so say.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">so to speak</span>: an apologetic mode of introducing an expression which might seem strange. In the thought itself there is no real difficulty, if we are careful to take into account the principle which prevailed throughout, that pre-eminence depended upon descent alone. Had Judah possessed an inherent superiority over his brother Levi, the descendants of Judah (in such a system as is here before us) might have claimed the like pre-eminence over the descendants of Levi. "Through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath payed tithes." The descendants of Abraham cannot but occupy a lower position in presence of one who appears as Abraham's superior.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes.</span> <span class="cmt_word">For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.</span> Or, in other words, "Nay, further, Melchizedek may be said to have tithed Levi himself and his priestly tribe." For, inasmuch as the whole position of Levi and his tribe, in the old dispensation, came by inheritance from the great patriarch who received the promises, the subordination of the patriarch to one above himself involved that of all who so inherited, it is not simply the physical descent of Levi from Abraham, but the peculiar position of the latter as "the patriarch," that justifies the assertion that Levi paid tithes through him. And thus, while we remember how Abraham is elsewhere viewed in Scripture as the representative of the chosen people, and also how the lives of individual patriarchs (notably so in the case of Jacob and Esau) are so told and referred to as to prefigure the positions and fortunes of the races they represent, we may recognize in this assertion no mere rabbinical fancy, but an interpretation true to the spirit of the Old Testament. Be it further observed that the original significance of Abraham's action as bearing upon his descendants is enhanced by the fact that, while it was <span class="accented">after</span> the receiving of the promise, it was <span class="accented">before</span> the birth of Isaac. He, and consequently his descendant Levi, was yet (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) in the loins of Abraham; on which point, "Proles e parenlis poteslate egressa in suam venit tutelain: sod quoad in parentis potestate, imo in lumbis est, illius conditionem sequitur" (Bengel). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/7-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">so</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5613.htm">Strong's 5613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably adverb of comparative from hos; which how, i.e. In that manner.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to speak,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipein)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
