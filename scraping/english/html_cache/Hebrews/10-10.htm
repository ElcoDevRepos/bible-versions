The will of God is often associated with His plan for salvation and redemption, as seen throughout the Old and New Testaments. In the context of Hebrews, it emphasizes the fulfillment of God's promise through Jesus Christ. This aligns with the prophetic declarations in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the suffering servant fulfills God's will for the redemption of humanity.<p><b>we have been sanctified</b><br>Sanctification here refers to being set apart for a holy purpose. In the Old Testament, sanctification was often achieved through rituals and sacrifices, as seen in Leviticus. However, the New Testament redefines sanctification through the work of Jesus Christ. This sanctification is not a repeated process but a definitive act accomplished through Christ's sacrifice, contrasting with the continual sacrifices under the Old Covenant.<p><b>through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ</b><br>The sacrifice of Jesus is central to Christian theology, fulfilling the sacrificial system of the Old Testament. The body of Jesus signifies His incarnation, emphasizing that He was fully human and fully divine. This sacrifice is a fulfillment of the typology seen in the Passover lamb (Exodus 12) and the sacrificial system outlined in Leviticus. Jesus' sacrifice is once and for all, unlike the repeated sacrifices of animals, which could not fully atone for sin.<p><b>once for all</b><br>This phrase underscores the finality and completeness of Christ's sacrifice. Unlike the repeated sacrifices of the Levitical priesthood, Jesus' sacrifice was sufficient for all time. This concept is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27 and 9</a>:12, where the author emphasizes the superiority of Christ's priesthood and sacrifice. The "once for all" nature of His sacrifice fulfills the prophecy of a new covenant found in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises a new way of relating to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to this verse, Jesus is the one whose sacrifice sanctifies believers.

Earlier in <a href="/hebrews/10-7.htm">Hebrews 10:7-9</a> Jesus declares, &#8220;Here I am&#8230;I have come to do Your will, O God.&#8221; That same will, foretold in <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7-8</a> and fulfilled as Christ obeyed the Father (<a href="/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>), replaces the old sacrificial system with something infinitely better. The emphasis is on purposeful, gracious intent: God willed our redemption, and nothing could thwart it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we have been sanctified</b><p>Notice the perfect tense: not &#8220;might be&#8221; but &#8220;have been.&#8221; Believers are set apart once and forever&#8212;made holy positionally&#8212;because Christ&#8217;s work is finished (<a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>). Paul echoes this certainty in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-11.htm">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>, &#8220;You were washed&#8230;you were sanctified&#8230;you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; Daily growth in holiness (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>) flows out of this already-secured standing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through the sacrifice</b><p>Sanctification is not achieved by effort, ritual, or law-keeping; it is &#8220;through the sacrifice.&#8221; <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a> reminds us that &#8220;without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness,&#8221; and <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a> underscores that the price paid was &#8220;the precious blood of Christ.&#8221; Every Old Testament offering pointed forward to this one decisive act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the body of Jesus Christ</b><p>The phrase grounds our faith in the incarnation.

By offering His physical life, He reconciled us &#8220;in His body of flesh through death&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>). A literal, tangible body was essential; a symbolic sacrifice would never satisfy divine justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>once for all</b><p>Here is the glorious finality: Christ&#8217;s offering lacks nothing and never needs repeating. <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a> declares He &#8220;sacrificed for sins once for all,&#8221; and <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a> says He secured &#8220;eternal redemption.&#8221; <a href="/romans/6-10.htm">Romans 6:10</a> adds, &#8220;The death He died, He died to sin once for all.&#8221; The door to God is permanently open; no additional payment is required.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a> celebrates God&#8217;s determined will, Christ&#8217;s obedient sacrifice, and the believer&#8217;s complete sanctification. Because Jesus offered His own body once for all, we stand forever set apart to God. Our ongoing growth in holiness flows from this unshakable position, and assurance rests not on our performance but on the finished, perfect work of our Savior.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">By the which will we are sanctified.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">In which will we have been sanctified.</span> In the last verse we read of that which Jesus established--the doing of the will of God. He did that will when He offered the sacrifice of His perfect obedience--"obedience as far as death" (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.">Philippians 2:8</a>). In this will of God which He accomplished lies our sanctification, effected "through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." In <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a> the efficacy of the blood of Christ to cleanse the conscience is contrasted with the power of the offerings of the law to "sanctify in regard to cleanness of the flesh:" here the real sanctification is joined with "the offering of the body of Jesus Christ." In the word "body" lies a reference to <a href="/hebrews/10-8.htm" title="Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin you would not, neither had pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;">Hebrews 10:8</a>, where the body is looked on as the instrument of obedient service (comp. <a href="/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>); but the word "offering" still preserves its sacrificial character, and contains an allusion to the presentation of the body of the slain victim. (Comp. <a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm" title="For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.">Hebrews 13:11</a>). As this offering has been presented "once for all" (<a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>), so "once for all" has the work of sanctification been achieved. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/10-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[And] by</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
