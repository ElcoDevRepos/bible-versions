Faith here is understood as trust and confidence in God and His promises, even when circumstances seem impossible. This faith is not merely intellectual assent but involves action based on belief. The faith of the Israelites in this context is a demonstration of their trust in God's power and His instructions.<p><b>the walls of Jericho fell</b><br>This refers to the miraculous event recorded in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>, where the walls of the fortified city of Jericho collapsed. Archaeological evidence suggests that Jericho was one of the oldest and most fortified cities in ancient Canaan, with massive walls that would have been humanly impossible to breach without divine intervention. The fall of Jericho's walls is a testament to God's power and faithfulness to His promises, as He had assured Joshua of victory over the city.<p><b>after the people had marched around them for seven days</b><br>The Israelites' march around Jericho was a test of obedience and faith. For six days, they circled the city once per day, and on the seventh day, they marched around it seven times. This unusual military strategy was commanded by God and required the Israelites to trust in His plan rather than their own understanding. The number seven often symbolizes completeness and perfection in the Bible, indicating the divine nature of the plan. This event also prefigures the idea of spiritual warfare, where victory is achieved not by human might but by following God's instructions. The seven-day march can be seen as a type of Christ, who brings victory through obedience to the Father, culminating in the ultimate triumph over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>An ancient city in the land of Canaan, known for its fortified walls.
