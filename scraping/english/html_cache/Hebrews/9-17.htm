This concept is rooted in the Greco-Roman legal system, which influenced the cultural context of the New Testament. The idea of a will taking effect only after death parallels the Old Testament covenants, which often required a sacrifice or death to be enacted. This phrase highlights the necessity of Christ's death to activate the New Covenant, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where a new covenant is promised. The death of Christ is the fulfillment of this promise, making the inheritance of eternal life available to believers.<p><b>it cannot be executed while he is still alive.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the legal principle that a will is not operational until the death of the testator. In the context of Hebrews, this underscores the necessity of Christ's sacrificial death for the New Covenant to be effective. The Old Covenant, established through the sacrificial system, required the shedding of blood for the atonement of sins (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). Similarly, the New Covenant required the death of Christ, the ultimate sacrifice, to be enacted. This reflects the typology of Jesus as the Lamb of God, whose death brings redemption and fulfills the prophetic imagery found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. The execution of the will, or covenant, is thus contingent upon the death of the one who made it, illustrating the profound theological truth of Christ's atoning work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.
