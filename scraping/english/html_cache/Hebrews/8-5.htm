The concept of a "copy and shadow" suggests that the earthly sanctuary was a temporary and imperfect reflection of the true, eternal sanctuary in heaven. This aligns with the Platonic idea of forms, where earthly things are mere shadows of their perfect heavenly counterparts. The tabernacle's design, with its specific dimensions and materials, was intended to symbolize deeper spiritual truths and the presence of God among His people. The idea of a heavenly temple is also seen in <a href="/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>, where God's temple in heaven is opened.<p><b>This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle:</b><br>Moses received direct instructions from God on Mount Sinai regarding the construction of the tabernacle, emphasizing the importance of following the divine blueprint precisely. This warning underscores the seriousness of adhering to God's commands and the sacredness of the task. The tabernacle was not merely a physical structure but a place where God would dwell among His people, making it essential that it be constructed according to God's specifications. This reflects the broader biblical theme of obedience to God's word.<p><b>&#8220;See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.&#8221;</b><br>This quote is a direct reference to <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>, where God instructs Moses to follow the pattern shown to him on Mount Sinai. The "pattern" indicates a divine design that Moses was to replicate on earth. This command highlights the importance of divine revelation and the need for human fidelity to God's instructions. The mountain, often a place of divine encounter in the Bible, signifies a place where heaven and earth meet, and where God reveals His will to humanity. The meticulous attention to detail in the tabernacle's construction points to the holiness and perfection of God, and foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence with His people through Jesus Christ, who is described as the true temple in <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and received the Law on Mount Sinai.

Moses had to follow the divine pattern exactly because the tabernacle was the gospel in architectural form. By seeing the copy, we recognize the substance; by studying the shadow, we rejoice in the Light.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Who serve unto . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">men who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things.</span> So in <a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm" title="We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.">Hebrews 13:10</a> we read of those who "serve the tabernacle." On the connection of thought, see <a href="/hebrews/8-3.htm" title="For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: why it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.">Hebrews 8:3</a>. "Copy," not in the sense of perfect resemblance, but rather a <span class= "ital">token</span> suggesting and designed to suggest the original. (See Note on <a href="/hebrews/9-23.htm" title="It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.">Hebrews 9:23</a>, where the same word is used.) "Shadow," as the shadow has no substance or independent existence, but represents only the outline of an object. (Comp. <a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>, where "shadow" is contrasted with "the very image"; and <a href="/colossians/2-17.htm" title=" Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.">Colossians 2:17</a>, where it is opposed to "the body.") We must not confound these words, "token" and "shadow," with "the pattern" mentioned in <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm" title="And look that you make them after their pattern, which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 25:40</a>, quoted later in this verse. The "heavenly things" are "the sanctuary" and "the tabernacle "of <a href="/hebrews/8-2.htm" title="A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.">Hebrews 8:2</a>, the realities to which the true earthly tabernacle corresponded; their nature can be understood only when Christ has come as High Priest of the good things to come. (See <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>.) That every part of God's earthly house might be a fitting emblem of spiritual truth to be afterwards revealed. Moses was charged in all respects to follow the pattern which had been shown him in the mount (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm" title="And look that you make them after their pattern, which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 25:40</a>). Jewish tradition understood these words to imply the presentation of a heavenly tabernacle to the sight of Moses, as a model to be imitated with exactness; and Stephen's words in <a href="/acts/7-44.htm" title="Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.">Acts 7:44</a>, "according to the pattern" (the same word is here used) "which he had seen," convey the same meaning. In itself, <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm" title="And look that you make them after their pattern, which was showed you in the mount.">Exodus 25:40</a>, when compared with <a href="/hebrews/8-9.htm" title="Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, said the Lord.">Hebrews 8:9</a> in the same chapter, does not necessarily involve a visible representation. But whether we think of a pattern shown in vision, or merely of explicit direction received by Moses, the meaning of "the heavenly things" remains the same. The view here presented of the Jewish tabernacle involves no depreciation, except in comparison with "the good things to come." It was only <span class= "ital">a shadow;</span> but it rises above all temples and symbols of man's art and device as being a shadow <span class= "ital">of the heavenly things.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> being such as do so; <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> here, as in <a href="/hebrews/9-23.htm">Hebrews 9:23</a>, means" representation," in the way of <span class="accented">copy</span>, not of <span class="accented">pattern.</span> "Shadow" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>) is opposed in <a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10</a>.

The reference here is to <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; the words which "the LORD spake unto Moses." Rabbinical writers, holding the view of an actual heavenly tabernacle, the prototype of the earthly one, have concluded from the passage in Exodus that Moses had a vision of it, or that a visible representation of it was exhibited to him on the mount. All that is necessarily implied is that he was divinely admonished to make the tabernacle after the fashion conveyed, in whatever way, to his apprehension when on the mount, so that it might be a true representation of some heavenly reality (cf. <a href="/acts/7-44.htm">Acts 7:44</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/8-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[They]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7989;&#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hoitines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3748.htm">Strong's 3748: </a> </span><span class="str2">Whosoever, whichsoever, whatsoever. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">serve at</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(latreuousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3000.htm">Strong's 3000: </a> </span><span class="str2">To serve, especially God, perhaps simply: I worship.
