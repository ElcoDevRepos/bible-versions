Biblical examples include Joshua leading the Israelites to conquer Canaan (Joshua 6) and David's victories over the Philistines (1 Samuel 17). These conquests were not merely military but were seen as acts of divine intervention, where faith in God's promises and commands led to triumph. Theologically, this reflects the belief that faith aligns believers with God's will, enabling them to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles.<p><b>administered justice</b><br>This refers to the role of faith in establishing and upholding justice. Figures like King Solomon, known for his wisdom and fair judgments (<a href="/1_kings/3-28.htm">1 Kings 3:28</a>), exemplify this. The administration of justice in ancient Israel was deeply connected to the covenantal laws given by God, emphasizing righteousness and equity. Faithful leaders were seen as instruments of God's justice, ensuring that His laws were upheld in society.<p><b>and gained what was promised</b><br>This phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's promises through faith. The patriarchs, such as Abraham, who received the promise of numerous descendants and a land (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>), are prime examples. Despite not seeing the complete fulfillment in their lifetimes, their faith was credited as righteousness (<a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>). This reflects the eschatological hope that believers hold, trusting in God's ultimate fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>who shut the mouths of lions</b><br>This alludes to the story of Daniel in the lions' den (Daniel 6), where faith in God led to miraculous deliverance. Daniel's unwavering commitment to prayer and obedience to God, despite the threat of death, exemplifies the protective power of faith. This event is also seen as a type of Christ, who through His faithfulness and obedience, overcame death and the grave. The shutting of the lions' mouths symbolizes God's ability to protect and deliver His faithful from harm.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/conquered_kingdoms.htm">Conquered Kingdoms</a></b><br>This phrase refers to the faithful individuals in the Old Testament who, through their faith in God, were able to achieve military victories and establish God's rule. Examples include Joshua, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land, and King David, who expanded Israel's territory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/administered_justice.htm">Administered Justice</a></b><br>This highlights the judges and leaders who, through their faith, upheld God's laws and ensured justice among the people. Figures like Samuel and Solomon are notable for their roles in maintaining justice and righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/obtained_promises.htm">Obtained Promises</a></b><br>This refers to those who received God's promises through faith, such as Abraham, who was promised numerous descendants, and Sarah, who bore Isaac in her old age.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shut_the_mouths_of_lions.htm">Shut the Mouths of Lions</a></b><br>This is a direct reference to Daniel, who, through his unwavering faith, was protected by God when he was thrown into the lions' den.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_as_a_catalyst_for_victory.htm">Faith as a Catalyst for Victory</a></b><br>Faith in God empowers believers to overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges, just as the heroes of faith conquered kingdoms.

Think of:<p>&#8226; Joshua at Jericho&#8212;he marched, shouted, and &#8220;the wall fell down flat&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>), proving God&#8217;s promise in <a href="/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3</a>.<p>&#8226; Gideon with just 300 men, smashing Midianite power because &#8220;the LORD said, &#8216;I will deliver you&#8217;&#8201;&#8221; (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>).<p>&#8226; David unifying Israel, defeating Philistine strongholds, and later declaring, &#8220;It is God who arms me with strength and keeps my way secure&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/22-33.htm">2 Samuel 22:33</a>).<p>Every victory shouted that faith is not wishful thinking but trust in a living Lord who intervenes in history (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>). When life feels like a battle, this line calls us to the same sturdy reliance: His promises have not weakened.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>administered justice</b><p>Faith isn&#8217;t only displayed on the battlefield; it shapes how God&#8217;s people govern and judge. In Scripture we see:<p>&#8226; Deborah judging Israel &#8220;under the palm tree&#8221; (<a href="/judges/4-4.htm">Judges 4:4-5</a>) and leading her nation to freedom.<p>&#8226; Samuel, who &#8220;judged Israel all the days of his life&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/7-15.htm">1 Samuel 7:15</a>) and held kings accountable.<p>&#8226; Solomon, asking for wisdom and rendering righteous verdicts, so that &#8220;all Israel&#8230;saw that the wisdom of God was in him&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/3-28.htm">1 Kings 3:28</a>).<p>Their faith produced action: fair courts, protection for the oppressed, and laws reflecting God&#8217;s righteousness (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). For us, it means trusting Him enough to do what is right, even when it costs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>gained what was promised</b><p>Faith also receives. The verse recalls believers who laid hold of tangible promises:<p>&#8226; Abraham and Sarah received Isaac, &#8220;the child of promise&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/21-1.htm">Genesis 21:1-3</a>; <a href="/romans/9-9.htm">Romans 9:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel entered Canaan so that &#8220;not one of all the LORD&#8217;s good promises to Israel failed&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>).<p>&#8226; Elijah prayed, and promised rain returned after three dry years (<a href="/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41-45</a>; <a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17-18</a>).<p>God&#8217;s timelines can stretch us, yet <a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a> urges, &#8220;Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for He who promised is faithful.&#8221; The record of fulfilled promises fuels endurance when ours seem slow in coming.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>shut the mouths of lions</b><p>The author then singles out a dramatic rescue: Daniel in the den. &#8220;My God sent His angel and shut the lions&#8217; mouths&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>). Daniel&#8217;s faith was tested in a hostile culture, yet he would not mute his daily prayers (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>). God honored that steadfastness, turning a deadly pit into a platform for His glory so that King Darius proclaimed, &#8220;He is the living God&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26-27</a>).<p>This line also echoes David&#8217;s earlier deliverance from a lion while shepherding (<a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-37</a>). Whether in literal dens or figurative ones&#8212;office politics, cultural pressure, even personal anxieties&#8212;faith trusts the same God who can silence every prowling threat (<a href="/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/11-33.htm">Hebrews 11:33</a> strings together victories, verdicts, fulfillments, and rescues to show the many-sided triumph of faith. It conquers, governs, receives, and survives because its object is God Himself&#8212;unchanging, truthful, all-powerful. The verse calls us to step into today&#8217;s battles, decisions, waits, and dangers with the same settled confidence: the God who acted then still acts now.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">Subdued kingdoms.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">overcame kingdoms.</span> To all the deliverers of Israel of whom we have read in <a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm" title="And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:">Hebrews 11:32</a> (and especially to David, 2 Samuel 8, 10, 11) these words will apply.
