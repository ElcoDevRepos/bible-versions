In the context of Hebrews, the author is contrasting Jesus with angels, highlighting His superiority and unique role in salvation. The use of "see" suggests a spiritual perception and understanding of Jesus' significance, as opposed to a mere physical sight.<p><b>who was made a little lower than the angels</b><br>This refers to the incarnation of Christ, where He took on human form and temporarily assumed a position lower than the angels. This is a reference to <a href="/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5</a>, which speaks of humanity's place in creation. Jesus, fully divine, humbled Himself to become fully human, sharing in our limitations and experiences.<p><b>now crowned with glory and honor</b><br>Following His resurrection and ascension, Jesus is exalted and seated at the right hand of God, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>. This crowning signifies His victory over sin and death and His rightful place as King and Lord. The imagery of a crown denotes authority and majesty.<p><b>because He suffered death</b><br>The suffering and death of Jesus are central to His mission and the salvation He offers. His death was sacrificial, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. This act of suffering was necessary for the atonement of sin.<p><b>so that by the grace of God</b><br>This phrase highlights the unmerited favor and love of God towards humanity. It is by God's grace that salvation is made possible through Jesus' sacrificial death. <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a> further explains that salvation is a gift from God, not earned by human effort.<p><b>He might taste death for everyone</b><br>"Tasting death" implies experiencing death fully and completely. Jesus' death was substitutionary, meaning He died in place of sinners, bearing the penalty of sin on behalf of all humanity. This universal aspect of His sacrifice is echoed in 1 <a href="/john/2-2.htm">John 2:2</a>, which states that He is the atoning sacrifice for the sins of the whole world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, the Son of God, who took on human form and suffered death for humanity's salvation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Spiritual beings created by God, often serving as messengers or agents of His will.

He was made a little (the rendering of the margin, "a little while," is much less probable) lower than angels, and He is crowned with glory. In one point we note an apparent departure from the sense of the Psalm, since words ("a little lower") which there denote dignity here denote humiliation. This difference is not essential; in each case it is the position of man that is signified, and our Lord's assumption of human nature must in any case be spoken of as a descent to a lower sphere. There is peculiar fitness in the use of the human name, Jesus, for Him in whom the Psalmist's words concerning man are literally fulfilled. It is noteworthy that we do not read, "We see all things put in subjection unto Jesus"--this would conflict with the truth stated in <a href="/hebrews/10-13.htm" title="From now on expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.">Hebrews 10:13</a> : other words of the Psalm are substituted, which do not imply that the complete actual subjection is already accomplished. This exaltation of One is not a substitute for, but involves (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and renders possible, the exaltation of the many. This is clear from the "not yet" of <a href="/hebrews/2-8.htm" title="You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.">Hebrews 2:8</a>; and the same truth is brought out in a different form at the close of this verse. In the midst of this application of the words of Scripture to Jesus, the writer introduces his first reference to His death. The offence of the cross (<a href="/galatians/5-11.htm" title="And I, brothers, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offense of the cross ceased.">Galatians 5:11</a>) was an ever-active force among Jews; this is present to the writer's mind throughout the Epistle. The words thus suddenly brought in here, reminding us that the exaltation of Christ was a reward for His obedience unto death (another echo of St. Paul--<a href="/context/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Philippians 2:9-10</a>; see also <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>), prepare for the more detailed teaching of the following verses--<a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="/context/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14-15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-17.htm" title="Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.">Hebrews 2:17</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The phrase <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, where it occurs in this verse with reference to Christ's temporary humiliation, is by many taken to mean "for a little while," on the ground that this meaning suits best the application to Christ, though its most obvious meaning in the psalm (quoted in ver. 7) is, as in the A.V., "a little." The Greek in itself will bear either meaning; and if "a little" be, as it seems to be, the original meaning in the psalm, there is no necessity for supposing a departure from it. All that the writer need be supposed to intimate is that Christ, through his incarnation, took man's position as represented in the psalm. <span class="cmt_word">For the suffering of death</span>. So the A.V. renders, connecting the words by punctuation with the clause preceding; the idea being supposed to be that Christ was "made a little lower than the angels" <span class="accented">with a view to</span> the "suffering of death;" <span class="accented">i.e. because of</span> the "suffering of death" which he had to undergo. But the proper force of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with the accusative is better preserved, and a better meaning given to the passage, by connecting <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> with the clause that follows, and translating, <span class="cmt_word">But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor</span>. His crowning was the consequence of his suffering; because of his suffering he was crowned; he won, as man, and in virtue of his human obedience unto death, his position of "glory and honor." Exactly the same idea is found in <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>, etc., where the purpose and result of Christ's suffering, here anticipated, are more explicitly set forth (cf. also <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). This view, too, suits the drift of the passage before us, which is that human nature has been exalted in the Person of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">That he, by the grace of God, should taste death for every man</span>. Two questions arise here: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As to the meaning of the expression, "that he should taste death," etc.; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as to the true reading, as well as the meaning, of the phrase translated "by the grace of God." As to <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span>, the clause is introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, followed by the subjunctive, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: and the construction of the sentence evidently connects it, not with <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, but with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> It is, "Because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, in order that for [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in behalf of] all he may taste of death." Now, the fact that the actual death was previous to the crowning suggests reference, not so much to it as to its permanent efficacy: and, further, the emphatic words are <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, as shown by their position in the sentence; and thus the idea seems to be, "In order that <span class="accented">for all</span> his tasting of death may be availing." And he may even be regarded as still tasting of death after his crowning, in the sense of knowing its taste through his human experience, and so perfectly sympathizing with mortal man (cf. <a href="/hebrews/5.htm">Hebrews 5</a>:15, and below in this chapter, vers. 14, 15). It is a further question whether <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> should be here taken as masculine, as in the A.V., or, like the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, as neuter, in the sense of "all creation." The latter rendering seems in itself more natural, though" all mankind" must be conceived as the main idea in the writer's view. At the same time, it is to be remembered how the redemption is elsewhere spoken of as availing for creation generally, for the restitution of universal harmony (cf. <a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>, etc.; <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10, 20</a>, etc.). A further reason for understanding <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in the wider sense will appear in our examination of the phrase next to be considered.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/2-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we see</span><br /><span class="grk">&#946;&#955;&#941;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(blepomen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_991.htm">Strong's 991: </a> </span><span class="str2">(primarily physical), I look, see, perceive, discern.
