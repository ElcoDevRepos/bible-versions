This ongoing ritual highlights the insufficiency of these sacrifices to provide a permanent solution for sin.<p><b>every priest stands to minister</b><br>The priests of the Old Covenant were required to stand while performing their duties, symbolizing the ongoing and unfinished nature of their work. Unlike the priests, Jesus, as our High Priest, is described in <a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a> as sitting down at the right hand of God, indicating the completion and sufficiency of His sacrifice.<p><b>and to offer again and again the same sacrifices</b><br>The repetition of sacrifices underscores their temporary and provisional nature. These offerings, including burnt offerings, sin offerings, and peace offerings, were prescribed in the Law of Moses and were intended to cover sins temporarily, pointing forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ.<p><b>which can never take away sins</b><br>The sacrificial system was unable to remove sin permanently; it could only cover it temporarily. This limitation is contrasted with the sacrifice of Jesus, whose death on the cross provides a once-for-all atonement for sin, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and fulfilled in the New Testament. The inability of animal sacrifices to cleanse the conscience is further discussed in <a href="/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9-14</a>, highlighting the need for a better covenant through Christ.<div

Naturally following from and completing the previous argument, it leads in the words "once for all" to a new thought, or rather prepares the way for the resumption of a subject to which in an earlier chapter marked prominence was given. If the sanctifying work of the true High Priest has been accomplished "once for all," such ministry remains for Him no longer (<a href="/context/hebrews/10-12.htm" title="But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;">Hebrews 10:12-14</a>).

(With the other reading the work of the priests in their daily ministrations is ascribed to the high priest, whose representatives they were.)
