The Levitical priesthood, established under the Mosaic Law, was hereditary and limited to the tribe of Levi. This change signifies a shift from the old covenant to the new covenant, where Jesus, from the tribe of Judah, becomes the eternal high priest. This transition is prophesied in <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, where it is declared that the Messiah will be a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek, indicating a new and superior priesthood.<p><b>the law must be changed as well</b><br>The change in priesthood necessitates a change in the law because the two are intrinsically linked. The Mosaic Law was centered around the Levitical priesthood, with its rituals, sacrifices, and temple services. With the advent of Christ's priesthood, the ceremonial aspects of the law are fulfilled and transformed. This is echoed in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, which speaks of a new covenant where God's laws are written on the hearts of His people. The change in law does not abolish the moral imperatives but fulfills and transcends them through Christ's perfect sacrifice and eternal priesthood, as explained in <a href="/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/melchizedek.htm">Melchizedek</a></b><br>A priest-king of Salem who is a type of Christ, representing a priesthood that predates and supersedes the Levitical priesthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levitical_priesthood.htm">Levitical Priesthood</a></b><br>The priesthood established under the Mosaic Law, originating from the tribe of Levi, specifically Aaron's descendants.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The ultimate High Priest in the order of Melchizedek, whose priesthood brings a new covenant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which governed the religious, moral, and social life of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrews.htm">Hebrews</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, likely Jewish Christians who were familiar with the Old Testament and the Levitical system.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_supremacy_of_christ's_priesthood.htm">The Supremacy of Christ's Priesthood</a></b><br>Jesus' priesthood is superior to the Levitical priesthood because it is eternal and based on the power of an indestructible life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_change.htm">The Necessity of Change</a></b><br>The change in priesthood necessitates a change in the law, highlighting the transition from the old covenant to the new covenant in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">The Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>The shift from the Levitical priesthood to the order of Melchizedek fulfills Old Testament prophecies and God's redemptive plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_under_the_new_covenant.htm">Living Under the New Covenant</a></b><br>Believers are called to live under the new covenant, which offers a direct relationship with God through Jesus, our High Priest.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_role_of_the_law.htm">Understanding the Role of the Law</a></b><br>The law served its purpose under the old covenant, but in Christ, we are under the law of grace and truth.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_7_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 7:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_7_12_Priesthood_law_change.htm">How does Hebrews 7:12 illustrate the change in priesthood and law?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_law_change_affect_Christians.htm">What implications does the "change of law" have for Christian living today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_7_12_and_Jesus_as_High_Priest.htm">How does Hebrews 7:12 connect to Jesus' role as our High Priest?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_priesthood_change_key_to_New_Covenant.htm">Why is understanding the "change of priesthood" crucial for interpreting the New Covenant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Heb_7_12_s_change_to_faith.htm">How can we apply the principle of change in Hebrews 7:12 to our faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Heb_7_12_on_Old_New_Covenants.htm">How does Hebrews 7:12 impact the understanding of the Old and New Covenants?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_priesthood_change_in_Heb_7_12.htm">What does the change in priesthood in Hebrews 7:12 signify for Christian theology?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_7_12_Jesus_eternal_priest.htm">How does Hebrews 7:12 relate to the concept of Jesus as the eternal high priest?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_hebrews_7.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Hebrews 7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_hebrews_7_mention_melchizedek.htm">Why does Hebrews 7 establish a priesthood &#8220;in the order of Melchizedek&#8221; (Hebrews 7:17), which appears to undermine the Levitical priesthood mandated in the Old Testament? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_the_law_of_moses_useful_or_not.htm">Is the law of Moses useful?
