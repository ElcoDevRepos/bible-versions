In the early church, leaders such as elders and overseers were appointed to guide and teach the congregation (<a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3:1-7</a>). The call to obedience and submission reflects a biblical principle of order and authority, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>, which speaks to the broader context of submitting to governing authorities. The cultural context of the time valued hierarchical structures, and this instruction aligns with maintaining unity and harmony within the church.<p><b>for they watch over your souls</b><br>Spiritual leaders are tasked with the responsibility of shepherding the flock, akin to the role of a shepherd caring for sheep (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>). This imagery is deeply rooted in biblical tradition, with Jesus Himself being referred to as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). The leaders' role is to provide spiritual guidance, protection, and nourishment, ensuring the well-being of the believers' souls. This duty underscores the gravity of their position and the trust placed in them by God.<p><b>as those who must give an account</b><br>Leaders are accountable to God for their stewardship of the church (<a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a>). This accountability is a sobering reminder of the weight of their responsibilities. The concept of giving an account is echoed in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where servants must report their actions to their master. This accountability ensures that leaders act with integrity and diligence, knowing they will answer to God for their leadership.<p><b>To this end, allow them to lead with joy and not with grief</b><br>The well-being of leaders is directly linked to the attitude and cooperation of the congregation. When believers support and encourage their leaders, it fosters a joyful and effective ministry. Conversely, resistance and strife can lead to grief and hinder the leaders' ability to serve effectively. This principle is reflected in Paul's relationship with the Philippians, where their partnership in the gospel brought him great joy (<a href="/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3-5</a>).<p><b>for that would be of no advantage to you</b><br>The spiritual health of the congregation is tied to the effectiveness of its leaders. When leaders are burdened with grief, it can negatively impact their ability to minister, ultimately affecting the entire community. The advantage, or benefit, of a harmonious relationship between leaders and followers is mutual growth and edification (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-16</a>).

The word itself (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) which is here used might, indeed, denote any persons who took the lead in the congregations; but the urging of the duty of <span class="accented">submission</span> to them, in virtue of their office of watching for souls for which they would have to give account, shows plainly that a special order is here, as elsewhere, referred to. Observe also below, ver. 24, where "<span class="accented">all</span> the saints," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> what we should call the laity, are mentioned in distinction from the <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. (For similar injunctions, cf. <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> being the words there used.) The special injunction here to obey and submit may have been called for by some deficiency in this respect among the Hebrew Christians. Possibly it was among the people rather than the pastors that there were any signs of wavering between the Church and the synagogue, and that one purpose of the admonition is to strengthen the hands of the former, in whom confidence is placed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/13-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Obey</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#949;&#943;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Peithesthe)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Passive - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3982.htm">Strong's 3982: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; to convince; by analogy, to pacify or conciliate; reflexively or passively, to assent, to rely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hym&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
