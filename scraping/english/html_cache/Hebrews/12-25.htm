In the context of Hebrews, "Him who speaks" refers to God, who has spoken through His Son, Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>). The warning is against ignoring the message of salvation offered through Christ. Historically, the Israelites often refused to listen to God's prophets, leading to their downfall (<a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-14</a>). This serves as a cautionary example for believers to remain attentive and obedient to God's word.<p><b>For if the people did not escape when they refused Him who warned them on earth,</b><br>This part of the verse refers to the Israelites who received the Law at Mount Sinai. Despite witnessing God's power and receiving His commandments, they often disobeyed, resulting in severe consequences, such as wandering in the wilderness for 40 years (<a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22-23</a>). The "Him who warned them on earth" is Moses, through whom God delivered the Law. This historical context underscores the seriousness of rejecting divine instruction.<p><b>how much less will we escape if we reject Him who warns us from heaven?</b><br>The comparison here is between the earthly warning given through Moses and the heavenly warning given through Jesus Christ. The argument is that if the Israelites faced judgment for rejecting the earthly message, the consequences are even more severe for rejecting the heavenly message of salvation through Christ. This reflects the New Covenant's superiority over the Old Covenant (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>). The phrase also alludes to the final judgment, where rejecting Christ's message results in eternal separation from God (<a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>). The warning is a call to recognize the gravity of the gospel and the eternal implications of accepting or rejecting it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/him_who_speaks.htm">Him who speaks</a></b><br>This refers to God, who communicates His will and warnings to humanity.

God&#8217;s voice was irresistible at Sinai and remains so today, now amplified through His Son from heaven. The past proves that no one evaded earthly judgments; the future guarantees none will escape heavenly judgment if they reject Christ. The right response is humble listening, immediate obedience, and grateful perseverance in the unshakable kingdom He freely offers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Refuse not</span>.--In <a href="/hebrews/12-19.htm" title="And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:">Hebrews 12:19</a> we have read that the Israelites entreated that they might no more hear the voice of God (literally, <span class= "ital">deprecated</span> the speaking of more words).

He from whom they turned aside on earth is He who now speaks to us; but then His voice was heard amidst earthly terrors, now His revelation comes through His Son who is exalted in heaven. If we do not hearken to the word of life and promise that is ever coming to us from God through His Son, it will be because we deliberately "turn away," for the excuse of the panic-stricken Israelites cannot be ours. The voice that speaks on earth fell on the outward ear, but He who speaks from heaven makes His voice heard in the inner conscience; the one may fail to be heard and understood, the other will find us out, and is neglected only through stubbornness of will. Much less, then, shall we escape if we turn away from Him who warns from heaven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">See that ye refuse not him that speaketh.
