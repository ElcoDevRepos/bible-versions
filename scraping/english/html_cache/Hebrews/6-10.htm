It reassures believers that God&#8217;s justice ensures that their efforts and sacrifices will not go unnoticed or unrewarded. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God&#8217;s justice is perfect and reliable, contrasting with human justice, which can be flawed.<p><b>He will not forget your work</b><br>The assurance that God remembers the work of believers is a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>, <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>). This phrase underscores the biblical principle that God values and acknowledges the faithful actions of His people. It also serves as an encouragement to persevere in good works, knowing that they are seen and valued by God, even if they are not recognized by others.<p><b>and the love you have shown for His name</b><br>This highlights the motivation behind the believers' actions&#8212;love for God. The phrase connects to the greatest commandment to love God with all one's heart, soul, and mind (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>). It suggests that true Christian service is driven by a desire to honor and glorify God&#8217;s name, reflecting a deep, personal relationship with Him.<p><b>as you have ministered to the saints</b><br>Ministering to the saints refers to serving fellow believers, which is a key aspect of Christian community life (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>). This service can take many forms, including providing for physical needs, offering spiritual support, and encouraging one another in faith. The early church was known for its communal support and care, which was a powerful testimony to the surrounding culture.<p><b>and continue to do so.</b><br>The ongoing nature of their service is emphasized here, indicating perseverance and faithfulness. This aligns with the biblical call to steadfastness in the faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>).

It appears that the Hebrew Christians had formerly (some especial occasion being probably referred to) been active in their charity towards fellow-Christians in distress, and that such charity had not ceased. On this is grounded the persuasion that they will be kept steadfast in the faith. Those who had so shown their faith by their works would surely not be allowed to lose it. The very idea of the Divine justice implies that the use of grace, thus evidenced, will be rewarded by continuance of grace. Cf. <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perfect it (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) until the day of Jesus Christ; "where also there is reference to deeds of charity, shown in the case of the Philippians by their sympathy with the apostle in his bonds, which charity he prays may "abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all discernment." No difficulty need be felt in this reference to God's justice, as though it involved the doctrine of human merit, <span class="accented">de congruo</span> or <span class="accented">de condigno</span>, claiming reward as of debt. The simple and obvious view, that God, in virtue of his justice, will be most gracious to those who have used his grace, by no means contravenes the doctrine of all grace being the free gift of his bounty (cf. <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>, etc.). Observe, too, as bearing on the idea of this passage, how the will to <span class="accented">do</span> the will of God is said by our Lord to be followed by knowledge of the <span class="accented">doctrine</span> (<a href="/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>), and how works of charity are the very tests of the final judgment (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/6-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#949;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Theos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2316.htm">Strong's 2316: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deity, especially the supreme Divinity; figuratively, a magistrate; by Hebraism, very.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[is] not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;</span> <span class="translit">(ou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
