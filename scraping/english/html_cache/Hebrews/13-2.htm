The early Christian community was encouraged to practice hospitality as a reflection of God's love and grace. In the Old Testament, hospitality was a sacred duty, as seen in the stories of Abraham (Genesis 18) and Lot (Genesis 19). The Greek word for hospitality, "philoxenia," literally means "love of strangers," emphasizing the importance of welcoming those who are not part of one's immediate community. This command aligns with Jesus' teachings on loving one's neighbor (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>) and reflects the broader biblical theme of caring for the marginalized and the foreigner (<a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>).<p><b>for by so doing some people have entertained angels</b><br>This phrase recalls the story of Abraham in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, where he unknowingly hosted three visitors who were angels, one of whom was the Lord Himself. This narrative underscores the idea that divine encounters can occur in ordinary circumstances and that God often works through unexpected means. The mention of angels also serves as a reminder of the spiritual realm's reality and the unseen presence of God's messengers. In the New Testament, angels are depicted as ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>), reinforcing the idea that hospitality can have spiritual significance beyond the immediate act of kindness.<p><b>without knowing it</b><br>The unawareness of entertaining angels highlights the humility and genuine nature of true hospitality. It suggests that acts of kindness should be performed without expectation of reward or recognition. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>, where He identifies Himself with the needy and emphasizes that service to others is service to Him. The phrase also serves as a caution against judging others based on appearances, as God often works through the least expected individuals and situations. This principle encourages believers to remain open-hearted and generous, trusting that God is at work in every interaction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_recipients_of_hebrews.htm">The Recipients of Hebrews</a></b><br>The letter to the Hebrews was addressed to Jewish Christians who were familiar with the Old Testament and the traditions of Judaism. They were likely facing persecution and needed encouragement to remain faithful to Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>In the context of this verse, angels are spiritual beings created by God who serve as His messengers. The reference to entertaining angels alludes to biblical accounts where individuals unknowingly hosted angels.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham_and_lot.htm">Abraham and Lot</a></b><br>These patriarchs are examples from the Old Testament who entertained angels without initially realizing their divine nature.

The prominence assigned to this duty in the exhortations of the Epistles of the New Testament was faithfully reflected in the practice of the early Church.<p><span class= "bld">Thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</span>--See Genesis 18, 19. The Greek word for "angels"--<span class= "ital">messengers</span>--of itself would serve to remind these Christians that, though the strangers whom they welcomed were but men, they might be special messengers of God. Clement of Rome, in his Epistle to the Corinthians (A.D. 95), appeals to the same examples (and also to Rahab): "For his faith and hospitality a son was given to Abraham in his old age. For his hospitality and godliness Lot was saved from Sodom."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not forgetful to entertain strangers</span> (or, <span class="accented">of hospitality</span>): <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</span> Allusions to this duty are frequent in the Epistles; its exercise would be of especial importance, in those days of persecution, towards scattered and destitute brethren as well as towards missionaries, though it by no means appears that it was meant to be confined to "them that are of the household of faith." Possibly some of the wavering Hebrew Christians might be becoming less ready to open their doors to the persecuted from fear of "reproach" in Jewish circles. The allusion of the latter part of the verse is evidently to Abraham and Lot (<a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>. and 19.). At any time the visits even of our fellow-men may be to us as visits of angels, as being messengers of God's purposes for good when least expected. And especially to be noted are our Lord's own words, "He that receiveth you receiveth me," etc., and "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/13-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Do} not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
