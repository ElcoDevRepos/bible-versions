The law included detailed instructions for sacrifices and purification rituals, emphasizing the necessity of blood for cleansing. <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a> states, "For the life of the flesh is in the blood," highlighting the significance of blood in atonement. The sacrificial system was central to the Israelites' worship and relationship with God, symbolizing the seriousness of sin and the need for purification. The use of "nearly everything" acknowledges that while most purification rites required blood, there were exceptions, such as the use of water or fire for certain objects (<a href="/numbers/31-23.htm">Numbers 31:23</a>).<p><b>and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness</b><br>This phrase underscores the theological principle that forgiveness of sins requires a blood sacrifice. The Old Testament sacrificial system pointed to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins (<a href="/hebrews/10-4.htm">Hebrews 10:4-10</a>). The concept of blood as a means of atonement is rooted in the Passover lamb (Exodus 12) and the Day of Atonement rituals (Leviticus 16), both of which prefigure Christ's sacrificial death. The necessity of blood for forgiveness is fulfilled in the New Covenant, where Jesus' sacrifice is once and for all, unlike the repeated sacrifices of the Old Covenant. This highlights the continuity and fulfillment of the Old Testament in the New Testament, emphasizing the sufficiency and finality of Christ's atoning work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law given to the Israelites, which included various sacrificial systems and rituals for purification and atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where sacrifices were made according to the Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_priest.htm">The High Priest</a></b><br>The chief religious leader in Israel who performed sacrifices and entered the Holy of Holies once a year on the Day of Atonement to offer blood for the sins of the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The ultimate High Priest and the perfect sacrifice, whose blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins, fulfilling the requirements of the Law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who were given the Law and the sacrificial system as a means to maintain a covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_blood_for_forgiveness.htm">The Necessity of Blood for Forgiveness</a></b><br>The shedding of blood is a divine requirement for the forgiveness of sins, as established in the Old Testament and fulfilled in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fulfillment_of_the_law_in_christ.htm">The Fulfillment of the Law in Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' sacrifice is the ultimate fulfillment of the sacrificial system, rendering the old covenant rituals obsolete and establishing a new covenant.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is a grave matter that requires a significant atonement, underscoring the need for a savior and the depth of God's grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_forgiveness.htm">The Assurance of Forgiveness</a></b><br>Believers can have confidence in the complete forgiveness of sins through the blood of Christ, leading to a life of gratitude and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_the_new_covenant.htm">Living in the New Covenant</a></b><br>Christians are called to live in the reality of the new covenant, embracing the freedom and responsibility it brings.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_9_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 9:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_9_22_Blood_needed_for_forgiveness.htm">How does Hebrews 9:22 emphasize the necessity of blood for forgiveness of sins?

Everything Israel did in worship&#8212;every sacrifice, festival, and priestly duty&#8212;was defined &#8220;according to the law&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3-8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-34.htm">Leviticus 16:34</a>). This lays an unshakeable foundation:<p>&#8226; God Himself set the terms for approaching Him.<p>&#8226; The law exposes sin and reveals our need for cleansing (<a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; It also foreshadows a greater reality that would come in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>).<p>Because the standard comes from God, it is not up for negotiation or human improvement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>nearly everything must be purified with blood</b><p>In the tabernacle and temple services, blood touched nearly every sacred object:<p>&#8226; The altar, basins, and utensils (<a href="/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12-21</a>).<p>&#8226; The ark, the scroll, and the people themselves (<a href="/hebrews/9-18.htm">Hebrews 9:18-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Even the high priest&#8217;s garments were sprinkled (<a href="/leviticus/8-30.htm">Leviticus 8:30</a>).<p><a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a> explains why: &#8220;the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls.&#8221; Blood symbolized poured-out life; it carried away defilement and marked what now belonged to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and without the shedding of blood</b><p>From Eden forward, God made it clear that sin produces death (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>; <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). He illustrated this when He clothed Adam and Eve with animal skins (<a href="/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a>) and when Abel&#8217;s acceptable offering involved a slain lamb (<a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>). Major moments in Israel&#8217;s story echo the same pattern:<p>&#8226; Passover deliverance rested on lambs&#8217; blood applied to doorposts (<a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The Day of Atonement required blood taken behind the veil for the nation&#8217;s sins (<a href="/leviticus/16-15.htm">Leviticus 16:15-16</a>).<p>Every drop pointed to a substitute bearing the sinner&#8217;s penalty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there is no forgiveness</b><p>Forgiveness is not simply God overlooking wrongdoing; it is God justly removing guilt. Hebrews reminds us that &#8220;it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-4.htm">Hebrews 10:4</a>). Those sacrifices covered sin temporarily, anticipating the one sacrifice that would deal with it finally and forever:<p>&#8226; Jesus entered the heavenly sanctuary &#8220;by His own blood, having obtained eternal redemption&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p>&#8226; At the Last Supper He said, &#8220;This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Now &#8220;the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<p>Because Christ shed His blood, God can forgive fully while remaining perfectly just (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a> ties the entire Bible&#8217;s redemption story together. God&#8217;s law demanded a life-for-life payment, so nearly everything under the old covenant was cleansed with sacrificial blood. Those repeated rituals were previews of the once-for-all shedding of Christ&#8217;s blood, the only means by which real and everlasting forgiveness is granted. The verse invites us to trust wholeheartedly in that finished work and to live cleansed, grateful lives in response.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">And almost all things.</span>--The meaning of the word "almost," as it stands in the Greek, is rather, "One may almost lay down the rule," "One may almost say." What follows, in both parts of the verse, is a general saying, modified by these introductory words. <span class= "ital">And one may almost say--according to the Law, all things are cleansed in blood, and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</span> To the first rule an exception is found in the various purifications by water or by fire (see <a href="/context/numbers/31-22.htm" title="Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,">Numbers 31:22-24</a>); to the second in the remarkable law of <a href="/context/leviticus/5-11.htm" title="But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil on it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.">Leviticus 5:11-13</a>. The expression "<span class= "ital">in</span> blood" is used because sprinkling with the blood of the slain victim was in figure a surrounding with, or inclusion within, the purifying element. On "cleansed" (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>) the best comment is found in <a href="/leviticus/16-19.htm" title="And he shall sprinkle of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.">Leviticus 16:19</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-30.htm" title="For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that you may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.">Leviticus 16:30</a>; on "forgiveness," in the words which in Leviticus 4 are repeatedly (<a href="/leviticus/4-20.htm" title="And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.">Leviticus 4:20</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-26.htm" title="And he shall burn all his fat on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-31.htm" title="And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a sweet smell to the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:31</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-35.htm" title="And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he has committed, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:35</a>) used of the effect of the sin offering, "it shall be forgiven him." The second clause of the verse is founded on <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm" title="For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you on the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul.">Leviticus 17:11</a>. By "shedding of blood" we must probably understand the slaying of the animal, rather than the pouring out of the blood by the altar (<a href="/leviticus/4-34.htm" title="And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:">Leviticus 4:34</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) With these words compare <a href="/luke/22-20.htm" title="Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.">Luke 22:20</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And almost</span> (rather, <span class="accented">eve may almost say that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>all things are according to the Law purified with blood; and without shedding of blood there is no remission.</span> The essentiality of blood, which is "the <span class="accented">life</span> of all flesh," for atonement and consequent remission, is emphatically asserted in <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, which expresses the principle of the whole sacrificial ritual.
