His faith is demonstrated through his actions, which align with the definition of faith as "confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see" (<a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>). Noah's faith is a model for believers, showing trust in God's promises despite the lack of visible evidence. This faith is consistent with the broader biblical narrative, where faith is often shown through obedience to God's commands.<p><b>when warned about things not yet seen</b><br>Noah received a divine warning about the impending flood, a future event that was unprecedented and unseen. This highlights the prophetic nature of God's communication with Noah, as well as Noah's ability to trust in God's word without physical evidence. This mirrors the Christian belief in the unseen realities of God's promises and the future fulfillment of His plans, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>, "For we walk by faith, not by sight."<p><b>in godly fear</b><br>Noah's response to God's warning was characterized by "godly fear," a reverent respect and awe for God's power and holiness. This fear is not terror but a recognition of God's authority and a motivation for obedience. <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom," indicating that such fear leads to wise and righteous living.<p><b>built an ark to save his family</b><br>Noah's construction of the ark was a tangible expression of his faith and obedience. The ark, a massive vessel, was built according to God's specific instructions (<a href="/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14-16</a>). This act of building the ark is a type of Christ, as the ark provided salvation from the flood, just as Christ provides salvation from sin. The ark's construction also demonstrates the importance of following God's guidance precisely.<p><b>By faith he condemned the world</b><br>Noah's faith and obedience stood in stark contrast to the wickedness of the world around him. His actions served as a condemnation of the world's unbelief and disobedience. This echoes the role of believers as witnesses to the truth, as seen in <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>, where light exposes darkness. Noah's life was a testimony to the righteousness that comes through faith.<p><b>and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith</b><br>Noah is described as an heir of righteousness, emphasizing that righteousness is received through faith, not works. This anticipates the New Testament teaching of justification by faith, as articulated in <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>, where Abraham's faith is credited as righteousness. Noah's inheritance of righteousness foreshadows the believer's inheritance in Christ, highlighting the continuity of God's plan of salvation through faith across both the Old and New Testaments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to build an ark and save his family from the flood.

(See the Notes on <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;">Hebrews 5:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm" title="Why we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:">Hebrews 12:28</a>.) Noah's obedience to the divine warning was an evidence at once of his fear of God and of the faith which gave substance and present reality to "the things not seen as yet."<p><span class= "bld">By the which.</span>--As before (<a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm" title="By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.">Hebrews 11:4</a>), the words "through which" are slightly ambiguous, for they may relate either to the ark or to the faith. The latter reference is more probable. His faith, shown in the building of the ark, exposed the unbelief of "the world," which would not listen to his warnings, and thereby incurred the divine condemnation. Our Lord uses "condemn" in the same sense in <a href="/context/matthew/12-41.htm" title="The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.">Matthew 12:41-42</a>. By the same faith Noah "became an heir of the righteousness which is <span class= "ital">according to faith.</span>" Noah is the first to receive in Scripture the name "righteous" (<a href="/genesis/6-9.htm" title="These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.">Genesis 6:9</a>). See also <a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm" title="Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 14:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/14-20.htm" title="Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.">Ezekiel 14:20</a>; and <a href="/2_peter/2-5.htm" title="And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;">2Peter 2:5</a>, "Noah, a preacher of righteousness." This righteousness is looked on as an <span class= "ital">inheritance, </span>received by all who manifest the faith. In this place the righteousness is connected with faith, as in the writings of St. Paul, but with a change of figure. It is not looked on as arising out of faith (<a href="/romans/10-6.htm" title="But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)">Romans 10:6</a>), or as resting on the condition of faith (<a href="/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Philippians 3:9</a>), or as obtained by means of faith (<a href="/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a>), but as corresponding with faith, or answering to it.

Hence the emendation, "moved with godly fear," in the recent "Revised Version." But, inasmuch as the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> has in the New Testament, as elsewhere, only its original import of caution or circumspection, there is no need to suppose here a further meaning (cf. <a href="/acts/23-10.htm">Acts 23:10</a>, the only other passage in the New Testament where the verb occurs). Ebrard, taking only prudent forethought to be expressed, enlarges on the lesson thus conveyed to the effect that he who acts on simple faith, regardless of the world's opinion or of ridicule, is the one who is truly prudent. And we may add that such prudence legitimately comes in as a motive in the religious life. The antecedent of "which" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), though the ancients generally understand <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, is taken as above by most moderns; the reason being, not only that <span class="accented">faith</span> (see in ver. 4) is the ruling idea of the whole passage, but also that it suits better the expressed results, especially the second, "became heir," etc. For to say that he became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith through the ark, as being the evidence of his faith, or as being the means of his preservation, is less intelligible than to say that through faith he became so. The sense in which Noah "condemned the world" is illustrated by <a href="/matthew/12-41.htm">Matthew 12:41, 42</a>, "The men of Nineveh," etc., "The queen of the <span class="accented">South</span>," etc. (cf. <a href="/romans/2-27.htm">Romans 2:27</a>). His becoming "heir," etc., rests on the view of the fulfillment of primeval promise being transmitted as an inheritance to the faithful. Noah, as he appears in Genesis, was eminently heir in this sense, as alone in his day appropriating it and as transmitting it to his seed. In like manner Abraham, who is next mentioned, was the prominent heir among the subsequent patriarchs (cf. <a href="/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13</a>). The idea running through the whole Old Testament is that, in the midst of a sinful world, an inheritance of salvation was transmitted through a chosen seed, till the Christ should come as the "Heir of all things," the perfected Head and Representative of all redeemed humanity. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> as that of which Noah was heir, may have been suggested with reference to him by his being the first who is called <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>, and by this being his usual designation (<a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 20</a>; Ecclus. 44:17; Wisd. 10:4, 6, Sir. 44:17; cf. <a href="/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>). The whole phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, may be taken to imply the Pauline doctrine of justification by faith, which may be supposed to have been familiar to the readers of this Epistle, having been already fully enunciated by St. Paul, and dwelt on by him as especially exemplified in Abraham. St. Paul, indeed, does not use this exact phrase, but <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11, 13</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/romans/10-6.htm">Romans 10:6</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>); but still the meaning may be the same. The correspondence is an instance of Pauline thought in this Epistle, while the difference of phrase affords a presumption, though by no means in itself conclusive, against Pauline authorship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/11-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">By faith</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Pistei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4102.htm">Strong's 4102: </a> </span><span class="str2">Faith, belief, trust, confidence; fidelity, faithfulness. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Noah,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#925;&#8182;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(N&#333;e)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3575.htm">Strong's 3575: </a> </span><span class="str2">(Hebrew) Noah.
