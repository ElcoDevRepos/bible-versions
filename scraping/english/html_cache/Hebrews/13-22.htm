This reflects the early Christian community's practice of viewing each other as spiritual family, transcending ethnic and social boundaries. The use of "urge" suggests a strong appeal, highlighting the importance of the message. This aligns with other New Testament writings where believers are encouraged to support and exhort one another (e.g., <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>).<p><b>to bear with my word of exhortation</b><br>The phrase "word of exhortation" suggests a message intended to encourage and strengthen the faith of the recipients. In the context of Hebrews, this likely refers to the entire epistle, which is filled with theological insights and practical advice. The call to "bear with" implies that the message may be challenging or require patience and perseverance to fully understand and apply. This is consistent with the broader theme of Hebrews, which encourages believers to remain steadfast in their faith despite trials (<a href="/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a>).<p><b>for I have only written to you briefly</b><br>This statement indicates that the author views the letter as a concise treatment of the topics addressed. Despite its brevity, the epistle covers significant theological ground, including the superiority of Christ and the call to faithfulness. The notion of brevity suggests that there is much more to explore and understand about the faith, encouraging readers to delve deeper into the teachings of Christ. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of continuous growth in understanding and wisdom (<a href="/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is debated.
