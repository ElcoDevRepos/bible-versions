In the early church, various heresies and false doctrines emerged, such as Gnosticism and Judaizing tendencies, which sought to add to or distort the message of Christ. The Apostle Paul similarly warns against false teachings in <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>. The emphasis here is on discernment and steadfastness in the truth of the Gospel, as taught by the apostles and rooted in Scripture.<p><b>for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace</b><br>Grace is central to the Christian faith, emphasizing God's unmerited favor and the transformative power of His love. This contrasts with legalistic practices that focus on human effort. <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a> highlights that salvation is by grace through faith, not by works.

The reference to foods echoes the debates in the early church about the role of Jewish dietary laws, as seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> and <a href="/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>. Jesus Himself declared all foods clean in <a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-19</a>, emphasizing that spiritual purity comes from the heart, not dietary observance.

Grace in Christ does.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/13-9.htm">Hebrews 13:9</a> urges believers to stay rooted in sound doctrine, refusing teachings that add or subtract from the gospel. True spiritual strength flows from God&#8217;s grace, not from ritual diets or any other human effort. Guard the heart, measure every message by Scripture, and rest in the sufficiency of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Be not carried about.</span>--The better reading of the Greek gives a meaning somewhat different, <span class= "ital">Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings.</span> The ordinary reading may have come in from <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm" title="That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;">Ephesians 4:14</a>. The "teachings" by which they were in danger of being led astray were various, and were all foreign to the one true word. The contrasts expressed in the second part of this verse and in <a href="/context/hebrews/13-10.htm" title="We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.">Hebrews 13:10-11</a>, throw light on the nature and source of the erroneous doctrine. Its subject was not "grace," but "meats;" its promoters were connected with those who serve the Tabernacle. Hence the writer is probably speaking of doctrines and practices similar to those censured by St. Paul in <a href="/context/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16-23</a>. (See the introductory Note on Romans 14; also <a href="/1_timothy/4-3.htm" title="Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.">1Timothy 4:3</a>.) In <a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm" title="Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.">Hebrews 9:10</a> we read of "meats and drinks" in connection with the Law of Moses; here the divers and strange teachings" must include human additions to that Law and perversions of its spirit.<p><span class= "bld">With grace; not with meats.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">by grace, not by meats.</span> Instead of being "carried away by strange teachings," let your hearts be made firm and sure by grace. As the whole system of ceremonial observance is alluded to under the one term "meats," so the blessings of the Christian faith are comprised under "grace," a word used throughout this Epistle with peculiar significance. (See especially <a href="/hebrews/10-29.htm" title="Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?">Hebrews 10:29</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-15.htm" title="Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;">Hebrews 12:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm" title="Why we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:">Hebrews 12:28</a>.) One human system of teaching will but lead on to another; grace will keep the heart firm in its loyal love to Jesus Christ, who is ever "the same" (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm" title="Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.">Hebrews 13:8</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not carried away</span> (so, according to the best authorities, rather than <span class="accented">carried about</span>) b<span class="cmt_word">y divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, in which they that were occupied</span> (literally, <span class="accented">that walked</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>were not profited.</span> From the exhortation to imitate the faith of the departed leaders, the transition is natural to warnings against being carried away from it by new teachings. The faith, which was their faith, remains unchanged, as Jesus Christ remains unchanged; why, then, these doctrines, new and strange (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-10</a>)? What these doctrines were is not shown, except so far as is intimated by the word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> ("meats"), which reminds us at once of similar warnings in St. Paul's Epistles (cf. <a href="/romans/14-2.htm">Romans 14:2, 14, 21</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 16</a>-723; <a href="/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>). These passages seem to refer in the first place to purely Jewish distinctions, still held to by Jewish Christians, between dean and unclean or polluted meats; and further to a new kind of asceticism, not found in the Old Testament, but based probably on notions of the impurity of matter, which led to entire abstention from flesh or wine, and also in some (<a href="/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>) from marriage; also, as appears from the passage in Colossians, a false philosophy about angels and the spiritual world. We may perceive in these allusions the germs at least of later Gnostic heresies, such as found (as that of the Ebionites) their first congenial soil in Jewish circles; Oriental theosophy, or neo-Platonic philosophy, being supposed to have been engrafted on Jewish modes of thought. Some, misled by what is said in ver. 10, see in the word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> an allusion to those sacrifices of the Law which were eaten by the worshippers, against any fancied obligation to partake in which the readers are supposed to be warned. But the word is never so applied in the Old Testament or the New (see above, <a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-34.htm">Leviticus 11:34</a>; 1 Macc. 1:16; <a href="/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15, 20</a>, 31; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8, 13</a>); nor would such error be likely to be classed among "strange doctrines." The drift of the warning is that the religion of the gospel does not consist in any of these notions or observances, the supposed importance of meats being specially noted, and that to make them its essence is a misconception of its whole meaning, and a departure from the faith: "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost" (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/13-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Do} not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
