The concept of "shrinking back" can be linked to the Israelites in the wilderness who doubted God's promises and faced destruction (<a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>). The historical context of Hebrews includes Jewish Christians tempted to revert to Judaism to avoid persecution. The warning against apostasy is a recurring theme in Hebrews (<a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-6</a>). The destruction mentioned here is spiritual, aligning with the eternal consequences of rejecting faith in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-31</a>).<p><b>but of those who have faith and preserve their souls</b><br>Faith is central to the message of Hebrews, as seen in the subsequent chapter, <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, which details the faith of the patriarchs. The preservation of the soul is a promise of eternal life, contrasting with the destruction of those who fall away. This phrase echoes <a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>, "the righteous will live by his faith," a verse also quoted in <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>, underscoring the doctrine of justification by faith. The preservation of the soul is not just survival but thriving in eternal communion with God, a theme consistent with the New Testament's teachings on salvation (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.
