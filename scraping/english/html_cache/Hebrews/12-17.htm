Esau's narrative is found in <a href="/genesis/25.htm">Genesis 25-27</a>, where he sells his birthright to Jacob for a meal. The "afterward" indicates the time after Esau realized the gravity of his decision and its irreversible consequences.<p><b>when he wanted to inherit the blessing</b><br>Esau's desire to inherit the blessing highlights the importance of the birthright in ancient Near Eastern culture. The birthright included not only material inheritance but also spiritual leadership and covenantal promises. Esau's desire came too late, illustrating the consequences of undervaluing spiritual blessings.<p><b>he was rejected</b><br>Esau's rejection serves as a warning about the finality of certain decisions. In <a href="/genesis/27-30.htm">Genesis 27:30-40</a>, Isaac confirms Jacob's blessing, and Esau is left with a lesser blessing. This rejection is a type of divine judgment, emphasizing the seriousness of spiritual neglect.<p><b>He could find no ground for repentance</b><br>This phrase underscores the idea that some opportunities, once lost, cannot be regained. Esau's inability to change his father's decision reflects the irreversible nature of some spiritual choices. It serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of timely repentance and valuing God's promises.<p><b>though he sought the blessing with tears</b><br>Esau's tears, as described in <a href="/genesis/27-38.htm">Genesis 27:38</a>, show his deep regret and emotional turmoil. However, his sorrow was not enough to change the outcome. This highlights the difference between worldly sorrow and true repentance, as discussed in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>.

The blessing of Jacob related in Genesis 27 is here viewed (apart from all attendant circumstances) as a necessary consequence of Esau's "profane" scorn of his birthright. Notwithstanding Esau's piteous entreaty, Isaac cannot but ratify (<a href="/genesis/27-33.htm" title="And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? yes, and he shall be blessed.">Genesis 27:33</a>) the blessing which he has pronounced; though his son sought the blessing earnestly with tears (<a href="/genesis/27-38.htm" title="And Esau said to his father, Have you but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.">Genesis 27:38</a>), he was rejected. He "found no place of repentance;" that first act (<a href="/genesis/25-33.htm" title="And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him: and he sold his birthright to Jacob.">Genesis 25:33</a>) could not be recalled, but brought with it a loss which nothing could retrieve.<p>(It is right to add that other interpretations of the verse have been given, which seem, however, much less probable. Thus, the last clause has been understood to mean that Esau earnestly sought repentance; and the preceding words, which we have placed in a parenthesis, that he could not bring his father to a change of purpose.)<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/12-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
