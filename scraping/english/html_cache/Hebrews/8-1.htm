The author has been discussing the superiority of Jesus Christ's priesthood over the Levitical priesthood. This statement emphasizes the importance of understanding the main argument being presented, which is the fulfillment and perfection of the priestly role in Jesus.<p><b>We do have such a high priest,</b><br>The term "high priest" refers to Jesus Christ, who fulfills the role of the ultimate mediator between God and humanity. Unlike the Levitical high priests who were limited by their humanity and sinfulness, Jesus is sinless and eternal. This connects to the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, which speaks of a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek, highlighting Jesus' eternal and perfect priesthood.<p><b>who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,</b><br>Sitting at the right hand signifies a position of honor and authority. In ancient cultures, the right hand was considered a place of power and privilege. This imagery is drawn from <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, where the Messiah is invited to sit at God's right hand. The act of sitting down also indicates the completion of His sacrificial work, contrasting with the Levitical priests who stood daily to perform their duties. Jesus' position at the right hand of God underscores His divine authority and the finality of His atoning work, as well as His ongoing intercession for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest.htm">High Priest</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, who serves as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.

The writer is tying together:<p>&#8226; The superiority of Jesus over angels, Moses, and Aaronic priests (<a href="/bsb/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise of a better covenant, anchored in Christ&#8217;s perfect priesthood (<a href="/hebrews/7-22.htm">Hebrews 7:22</a>).<p>So, the verse invites us to pause and focus on one climactic reality, much like Paul does in <a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a> (&#8220;Therefore, there is now no condemnation&#8230;&#8221;) or Peter in <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6</a> (&#8220;See, I lay in Zion&#8230;&#8221;).

The words joined with it, "in the things which we are saying," would lead us to prefer the second rendering; and when the course of the argument is traced we find it difficult to believe that the writer could express a <span class= "ital">summary</span> of his thought in such words as those which follow.<p><span class= "bld">Who is</span> <span class= "bld">set.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">who sat down.</span> Twice before have the words of <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a> been thus referred to Jesus (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-13.htm" title="But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?">Hebrews 1:13</a>), but their full significance in regard to the present subject has yet to be brought out. When in <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a> we read, "such an high priest became us," we must look to what precedes for the explanation--"such a one" as has already been portrayed. Here the case is different, and the meaning of "such" is found in the description which the following words contain. The last verse of Hebrews 7 united the two predictions which pointed to Jesus as Priest and King, and the same thought is contained here, expressed in language which at once recalls <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>. A later passage (<a href="/context/hebrews/10-11.htm" title="And every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:">Hebrews 10:11-12</a>) will show that the words "sat down" have yet further significance, involving a contrast to the continued and ever incomplete services of those who "stood before God" in His earthly sanctuary. The next verse must be closely joined with this, for the contrast just spoken of does not imply that He no longer "ministers" on behalf of men (see <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm" title="Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.">Hebrews 7:25</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>); on the contrary, it is as "a minister" of the sanctuary that He sat down on the right hand of God. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the chief matter in</span> (or, <span class="accented">in regard to</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the things which are being said is</span> (or, <span class="accented">to sum up what we are saying</span>).
