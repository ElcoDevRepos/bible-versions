In the context of Hebrews, it refers to the words of Christ, highlighting His role as the ultimate revelation of God's will. This continuation underscores the progressive nature of God's revelation, moving from the old covenant to the new.<p><b>&#8220;Here I am, I have come to do Your will.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration reflects Christ's submission and obedience to the Father, fulfilling the messianic prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7-8</a>. It emphasizes the incarnation of Jesus, who came to fulfill God's redemptive plan. The phrase highlights the voluntary nature of Christ's mission, aligning with the theme of obedience seen throughout the Gospels, such as in <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>, where Jesus states He came to do the will of the Father.<p><b>He takes away the first</b><br>This refers to the removal of the first covenant, the Mosaic Law, which was based on sacrifices and rituals. The old covenant was temporary and served as a shadow of the good things to come (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>). The taking away of the first signifies the fulfillment and completion of the law through Christ's perfect sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>, where Jesus states He came to fulfill the law.<p><b>to establish the second.</b><br>The second covenant, the new covenant, is established through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This new covenant is characterized by grace and truth, offering a direct relationship with God through faith in Christ. It fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises a new covenant written on the hearts of His people.

The verse assures believers that, because Jesus perfectly did the Father&#8217;s will, nothing more needs to be added for our forgiveness and fellowship with God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Then said he, Lo, I come.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">then hath he said, Lo, I am come to do Thy will.</span> The words "O God" are not in the true text, but have been accidentally repeated from <a href="/hebrews/10-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do your will, O God.">Hebrews 10:7</a>.<p><span class= "bld">He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.</span>--It is important to inquire how this is done, first in the case of the writer of the psalm, then as the words are used of Jesus. David, perceiving that that which God seeks is the subjection of man's will, refuses to rest in the sacrifices of the law. No one will think that burnt offering or gift or sacrifice for sin was henceforth at an end for him: the confession of his iniquities (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm" title="But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;">Hebrews 10:12</a>) implied a recourse to the appointed means of approach to God: even the sacrifices themselves were taken up into the service of obedience. But to the symbols shall be added the consecration and the sacrifice of praise (<a href="/psalms/50-23.htm" title="Whoever offers praise glorifies me: and to him that orders his conversation aright will I show the salvation of God.">Psalm 50:23</a>) which they typified. The application to the Saviour must be interpreted by this context. In making these words His own, He declares the sacrifices of the law to be in themselves without virtue; Jehovah seeks them not from Him, but, having prepared a human body for Him, seeks only the fulfilment of His will. But included in that will of God was Christ's offering of Himself for the world; and, on the other hand, it was His perfect surrender of Himself that gave completeness to that offering. His death was at once the antitype of the sacrifice for sin and the consummation of the words, "I am come to do Thy will, O God." Hence, in saying, "Lo, I am come to do Thy will" (that which God has really willed), He taketh away the sacrifices of slain animals that He may establish the doing of God's will. That such sacrifices as were formerly offered are no longer according to God's pleasure follows as an inference from this.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/10-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
