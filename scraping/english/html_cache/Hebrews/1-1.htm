It suggests that God's revelation was not a one-time event but occurred repeatedly over time. This aligns with the biblical narrative where God interacted with His people at various points, such as with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and others. Each occasion was part of a progressive revelation leading to the ultimate revelation in Jesus Christ.<p><b>and in many different ways</b><br>God's methods of communication were diverse, including dreams, visions, direct speech, and symbolic actions. For example, God spoke to Moses through a burning bush (Exodus 3), to Joseph through dreams (Genesis 37), and to Elijah in a gentle whisper (<a href="/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12</a>). This diversity underscores God's creativity and adaptability in ensuring His message was understood by different people in different contexts.<p><b>God spoke to our fathers</b><br>The term "our fathers" refers to the patriarchs and ancestors of the Jewish people, emphasizing the continuity of God's covenant relationship with Israel. This phrase connects the audience of Hebrews to their rich heritage and the faithfulness of God to their forebears. It also highlights the communal aspect of God's revelation, as it was given to a people, not just individuals.<p><b>through the prophets</b><br>Prophets were God's chosen messengers, serving as intermediaries between God and His people. They played a crucial role in guiding, warning, and encouraging Israel. Figures like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel were instrumental in delivering God's messages. The prophetic tradition is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, and the prophets often pointed forward to the coming of the Messiah, fulfilled in Jesus Christ.

The writer's object is to place the former revelation over against that which has now been given; and the remarkable words with which the chapter opens (and which might not inaptly serve as the motto of the whole Epistle) strike the first note of contrast. If we may imitate the artistic arrangement of the Greek, the verse will run thus, "In many portions and in many ways God having of old spoken unto the fathers in the prophets." To the fathers of the Jewish people (comp. <a href="/romans/9-5.htm" title="Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 9:5</a>) God's word was given part by part, and in divers manners. It came in the revelations of the patriarchal age, in the successive portions of Holy Writ: various truths were successively unveiled through the varying ministry of law, and of prophecy, and of promise ever growing clearer through the teaching of experience and history. At one time the word came in direct precept, at another in typical ordinance or act, at another in parable or psalm. The word thus dealt out in fragments and variously imparted was God's word, for the revealing Spirit of God was "in the prophets" (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.">2Corinthians 13:3</a>). We must not unduly limit the application of "prophet"; besides those to whom the name is directly given, there were many who were representatives of God to His people, and interpreters of His will. (Comp. <a href="/numbers/11-26.htm" title="But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested on them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out to the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.">Numbers 11:26</a>; <a href="/numbers/11-29.htm" title="And Moses said to him, Envy you for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit on them!">Numbers 11:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-15.htm" title="Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.">Psalm 105:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Retaining the order of the words in the original, we may translate, <span class="cmt_word">In many portions, and in many modes of old God having spoken to the fathers in the prophets</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;</span> a mere alliterative redundancy, denoting <span class="accented">variously</span>: <span class="accented"> -</span> the writer's usual choice use of words forbids this supposition. Nor is the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> of the first adverb to be taken (as in the A.V.) to denote portions of <span class="accented">time</span>: <span class="accented">- this is not</span> the proper meaning of the compound. Nor (for the same reason) does it denote various <span class="accented">degrees</span> of prophetic inspiration, but (on etymological as well as logical grounds) the various <span class="accented">portions</span> of the preparatory revelation to "<span class="accented">the</span> fathers." It was not one utterance, but many utterances; given, in fact, at divers times, though it is to the diversity of the utterances, and not of the times, that the expression points. Then the second adverb denotes the various <span class="accented">modes</span> of the several former revelations - not necessarily or exclusively the rabbinical distinction between dream, vision, inspiration, voices, angels; or that between the visions and dreams of prophets and the "mouth to mouth" revelation to Moses, referred to in <a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-9</a>; but rather the various characters or forms of the various utterances in themselves. Some were in the way of primeval promises; some of glimpses into the Divine righteousness, as in the Law given from Mount Sinai; some of significant ritual, as in the same Law; some of typical history and typical persons, spoken of under inspiration as representing an unfulfilled ideal; some of the yearnings and aspirations, or distinct predictions, of psalmists and of prophets. But all these were but partial, fragmentary, anticipatory utterances, leading up to and adumbrating the 'one complete, all-absorbing "speaking of God to us in the SON<span class="accented"></span>," which is placed in contrast with there all. If the subsequent treatment in this Epistle of the Old Testament utterances is to be taken as a key for unlocking the meaning of the exordium, such ideas were in the writer's mind when he thus wrote. "<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> pertinet ad materiam, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> ad formam" (Bengel). <span class="accented">Of old</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the ages comprised in the Old Testament record. Though it is true that; God has revealed himself variously since the world was made to other than the saints of the Old Testament, and though he ceased not to speak in some way to his people between the times of Malachi and of Christ, yet both the expression, "to the fathers," and the instances of Divine utterances given subsequently in the Epistle, restrict us in our interpretation to the Old Testament canon. Addressing Hebrews, it is from this that the writer argues. <span class="accented">Having spoken</span>; <span class="accented">a</span> word used elsewhere to express all the ways in which God has made himself, his will, and his counsels, known (cf. <a href="/matthew/10-20.htm">Matthew 10:20</a>; <a href="/luke/1-45.htm">Luke 1:45, 70</a>; <a href="/john/9-29.htm">John 9:29</a>; <a href="/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>; <a href="/acts/7-6.htm">Acts 7:6</a>). <span class="accented">To the fathers</span>; the ancestors of the Jews in respect both of race and of faith; the saints of the Old Testament. The word had a well-understood meaning (cf. <a href="/matthew/23-30.htm">Matthew 23:30</a>; <a href="/luke/1-55.htm">Luke 1:55, 72</a>; <a href="/luke/11-47.htm">Luke 11:47</a>; and especially <a href="/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>). For the double sense of the term "father," thus used, see <a href="/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56</a>, "your father Abraham;" but again, <a href="/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>, "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham;" and also <a href="/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a>. and <a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>. But this distinction between physical and spiritual ancestry does not come in here. <span class="accented">In the prophets.</span> The word "prophet" must be taken here in a general sense; not confined to the prophets distinctively so called, as in <a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>, "Moses, the prophets, and the psalms." For both Moses and the psalms are quoted in the sequel, to illustrate the ancient utterances. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> means, both in classical and Hellenistic Greek (as does the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, of which <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> is the equivalent), not a foreteller, but a forth teller of the mind of God, an inspired expounder (cf. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, AEsch., 'Eum.,' 19; and <a href="/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>, "See I have made thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy <span class="accented">prophet"</span>). Observe also the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in St. Paul's Epistles (especially <a href="/1_corinthians/14.htm">1 Corinthians 14</a>.). In this sense Moses, David, and all through whom God in any way spoke to man, were prophets. On the exact force of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, many views have been entertained. It does not mean "in the books of the prophets," - the corresponding "in the SON" precludes this; nor that God by his Spirit spoke <span class="accented">within</span> the prophets, - this idea does not come in naturally here; nor is "the SON" presented afterwards as one in whom the Godhead dwelt, so much as being himself a manifestation of God; nor may we take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, as simply a Hellenism for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>, - the writer does not use prepositions indiscriminately. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span>, (as Alford explains it) differs from <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> as denoting the element in which this speaking takes place. This use of the preposition is found also in classical Greek; cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, frequent in Xenophon; in the New Testament, cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/matthew/9-34.htm">Matthew 9:34</a>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/1-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{On many} past</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(palai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3819.htm">Strong's 3819: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of old, long ago, in times past, former.
