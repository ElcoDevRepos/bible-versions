Notable examples include the widow of Zarephath (<a href="/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17-24</a>) and the Shunammite woman (<a href="/2_kings/4-18.htm">2 Kings 4:18-37</a>), both of whom had their sons restored to life through the prophets Elijah and Elisha, respectively. These events demonstrate God's power over life and death and serve as a foreshadowing of the ultimate resurrection through Jesus Christ. The cultural context of the time placed significant value on family and lineage, making these miracles particularly impactful for the women involved.<p><b>Others were tortured and refused their release,</b><br>This part of the verse refers to individuals who endured severe persecution and chose to remain steadfast in their faith rather than accept deliverance that would require them to renounce their beliefs. The historical context includes the Maccabean period, where Jewish martyrs faced torture under Antiochus IV Epiphanes, as recorded in 2 Maccabees 6-7. These acts of faithfulness are seen as a testament to the strength and conviction of those who prioritize eternal promises over temporary relief.<p><b>so that they might gain a better resurrection.</b><br>The concept of a "better resurrection" implies a future hope that surpasses the temporary restoration of life experienced by the women mentioned earlier. This hope is rooted in the belief in eternal life through Jesus Christ, as promised in the New Testament (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>). The idea of a better resurrection is connected to the ultimate victory over death and the promise of eternal life, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</a>.

Scripture records two literal events behind this line:<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17&#8211;24</a>&#8212;the widow at Zarephath watches Elijah pray, and &#8220;the child&#8217;s life returned to him, and he lived.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_kings/4-18.htm">2 Kings 4:18&#8211;37</a>&#8212;the Shunammite woman appeals to Elisha; her son is restored when &#8220;the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.&#8221;<p>In both stories the mothers hold fast to God&#8217;s word through His prophets, and the Lord honors that faith with present-tense resurrection. The writer of Hebrews points to these histories to remind believers that the God who once conquered death still does.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Raised to life again</b><p>The clause repeats the miracle to underline God&#8217;s power over the grave. Other real-world examples reinforce the point: Jairus&#8217;s daughter (<a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41-42</a>), the widow&#8217;s son at Nain (<a href="/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14-15</a>), and Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43-44</a>). Each resurrection foreshadows the ultimate victory announced by Jesus: &#8220;I am the resurrection and the life&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>). Hebrews celebrates faith that expects God not merely to comfort in sorrow but to reverse it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Others were tortured</b><p>The verse pivots sharply: &#8220;Others were tortured.&#8221; Faith does not always yield immediate deliverance; sometimes it meets brutal opposition. Old Testament saints endured beatings (<a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>), stocks (<a href="/jeremiah/37-15.htm">Jeremiah 37:15</a>), and stoning (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-21.htm">2 Chronicles 24:21</a>). Daniel&#8217;s friends faced the furnace (<a href="/daniel/3-16.htm">Daniel 3:16-18</a>), Daniel the lions&#8217; den (<a href="/daniel/6-16.htm">Daniel 6:16-17</a>). The early church echoed the pattern: apostles flogged yet rejoicing (<a href="/acts/5-40.htm">Acts 5:40-41</a>). Hebrews honors these believers alongside the miracle-receivers, showing that both experiences grow out of the same trust in God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Refused their release</b><p>Some captives were offered freedom if they would compromise. Instead they &#8220;refused their release,&#8221; choosing allegiance to the Lord over escape. <a href="/acts/4-18.htm">Acts 4:18-20 and 5</a>:28-29 reflect this resolve: &#8220;We must obey God rather than men.&#8221; Paul echoes it from a Roman cell: &#8220;I am ready not only to be bound, but even to die for the name of the Lord Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/acts/21-13.htm">Acts 21:13</a>). Genuine faith clings to truth even when the exit door is unlocked.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that they might gain a better resurrection</b><p>The tortured saints looked beyond temporary relief to &#8220;a better resurrection.&#8221; Unlike the earlier restorations&#8212;which still ended in physical death&#8212;this resurrection is final, bodily, eternal. <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> foresees it: &#8220;Many who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake&#8230; to everlasting life.&#8221; Jesus secures it by His own empty tomb (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-23</a>). For believers, every sacrifice is weighed against the unshakeable promise: &#8220;The dead in Christ will rise first&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). Choosing present suffering over compromise is never loss; it is an investment in forever.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/11-35.htm">Hebrews 11:35</a> contrasts two equally authentic outcomes of faith. Some saints experienced dramatic, present-day victories; others embraced suffering, trusting God for everlasting reward. In both cases the Lord remained faithful. Whether He answers now with miraculous deliverance or later with &#8220;a better resurrection,&#8221; our call is the same: keep believing, because the God who conquers death still writes the final chapter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">Raised to life again.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">by a resurrection.</span> (See <a href="/context/1_kings/17-22.htm" title="And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.">1Kings 17:22-23</a>; <a href="/context/2_kings/4-35.htm" title="Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself on him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.">2Kings 4:35-37</a>.) At this point the character of the record is changed; hitherto we have heard of the victories of faith in action, now it is of the triumph of faith over suffering that the writer speaks. Those who "escaped the edge of the sword" (<a href="/hebrews/11-34.htm" title="Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.">Hebrews 11:34</a>) and those who "were slain with the sword" alike exemplified the power of faith.<p><span class= "bld">Others were tortured.</span>--See the account of the aged Eleazar (<a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/6-30.htm" title="But when he was ready to die with stripes, he groaned, and said, It is manifest unto the Lord, that hath the holy knowledge, that whereas I might have been delivered from death, I now endure sore pains in body by being beaten: but in soul am well content to suffer these things, because I fear him.">2 Maccabees 6:30</a>), martyred because he would not pollute himself with swine's flesh and the "flesh taken from the sacrifice commanded by the king." The following chapter records the martyrdom of seven brethren, who for their adherence to their law were put to death with cruel tortures. (See especially <a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm" title="By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:">Hebrews 11:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-14.htm" title="For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.">Hebrews 11:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-23.htm" title="By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.">Hebrews 11:23</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-29.htm" title="By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.">Hebrews 11:29</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-36.htm" title="And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yes, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:">Hebrews 11:36</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Women received their dead raised to life again</span> (literally, <span class="accented">from</span>, or, <span class="accented">out of resurrection.</span> The A.V. gives the sense in good English; only the force of the repetition of the word "resurrection" at the end of the verse is lost); <span class="cmt_word">and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.</span> The first part of this verse evidently refers to <a href="/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a> and <a href="/2_kings/4-36.htm">2 Kings 4:36</a> - the memorable instances in the Old Testament of mothers having had their sons restored to them from death. The latter part is as evidently suggested at least by the narrative of 2 Macc. 7; where it is recorded how, under the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, seven sons of one mother were tortured and put to death; how one of them, in the midst of his tortures, having deliverance and advancement offered him if he would forsake the Law of his fathers, courageously refused the offer; and how both they and their mother, who encouraged them to persevere, reiterated their hope of a resurrection from the dead. The "better resurrection" means the resurrection to eternal life by them looked for, which was "better" than the temporary restoration to life in this world granted to the sons of the widow of Zarephath and the Shunammite; while the article in the Greek before "deliverance" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) may be due to the thought of that which is recorded to have been offered to those in the writer's immediate view.

The usual meaning of the Greek word is" to beat," as a drum is beaten, from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a drum or drumstick: and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means "to beat to death." But, inasmuch as the instrument of torture to which Eleazar (whose martyrdom is related in the preceding chapter of 2 Maccabees) was brought is called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (6:19, 28), it has been supposed that the punishment referred to was the stretching of the victims, in the way of a rack, on a sort of wheel called a <span class="accented">tympanum</span>, on which they were then beaten to death, as Eleazar was. So Vulgate, <span class="accented">distenti sunt.</span> The fact that the seven of 2 Macc. 7. were not so martyred, but by fire and other tortures, is not inconsistent with this view; for our author need not be supposed to confine his view to them, but uses the word suggested by Eleazar's case. Whatever be the exact import of the word, the A.V. ("were tortured") sufficiently gives the generally intended meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/11-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Women</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#8150;&#954;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(gynaikes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1135.htm">Strong's 1135: </a> </span><span class="str2">A woman, wife, my lady.
