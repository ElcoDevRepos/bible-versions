This aligns with the early church's practice of meeting regularly for fellowship, teaching, and prayer (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>). The term "daily" underscores the necessity of constant vigilance and support, reflecting the communal lifestyle of early Christians who often faced persecution and needed continual encouragement to remain steadfast in their faith.<p><b>as long as it is called today</b><br>The phrase "as long as it is called today" highlights the urgency and immediacy of the exhortation. It echoes <a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7-8</a>, which warns against hardening one's heart and emphasizes the present moment as the time for obedience and faithfulness. This urgency is a reminder of the transient nature of life and the importance of seizing the opportunity to encourage one another while it is still possible.<p><b>so that none of you may be hardened</b><br>The warning against being "hardened" refers to the spiritual danger of becoming insensitive or resistant to God's voice. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, where the Israelites' repeated disobedience led to a hardened heart (<a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8</a>). The hardening of the heart is a gradual process that can result from neglecting spiritual disciplines and community support, making the role of mutual exhortation crucial.<p><b>by sin&#8217;s deceitfulness</b><br>Sin is described as deceitful, indicating its ability to mislead and entrap believers. This deceitfulness can manifest in subtle ways, leading individuals away from truth and righteousness. The Bible frequently warns against the deceptive nature of sin (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>), which can appear attractive or harmless but ultimately leads to spiritual death.

Here again, as in ver. 12, the possible result of obdurate unbelief is distinctly traced to moral culpability. Sin is a deceiver (cf. <a href="/romans/7-11.htm">Romans 7:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>); it distorts the spiritual vision, causes us to take false views of things, and to lose our clear view of truth; and continued dalliance with sin may hare its result in final obduracy, which, as above remarked, is our own doing as it comes of our sin, God's doing as it comes of his judgment. The sin contemplated in the case of the Hebrew Christians as not unlikely to have its result in obduracy was, not only imperfect appreciation of the true character of the gospel revelation, and consequent remissness in mutual admonition and attendance at Christian worship (<a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>), but also, as a further consequence of such remissness, failure in the moral purity of life, the active charity, the disentanglement from the world, and the endurance of persecution, required of Christians. This appears from the earnest exhortations that follow afterwards against all such shortcomings (see especially <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-26, 32-39</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1-18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-1.htm">Hebrews 13:1-20</a>). It was especially by conscientious perseverance in the religious life that they might hope to keep their religious faith steadfast and unclouded to the end; in accordance with Christ's own saying, "If any man <span class="accented">will</span> do (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/3-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
