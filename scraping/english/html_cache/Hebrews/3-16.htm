They heard God's commands and promises through Moses but chose to rebel. This rebellion is documented in several instances, such as the golden calf incident (Exodus 32) and the refusal to enter the Promised Land due to fear (Numbers 13-14). The rhetorical question emphasizes the accountability of those who have received divine revelation yet choose disobedience. It serves as a warning to believers to heed God's voice and remain faithful.<p><b>Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?</b><br>This phrase highlights the collective nature of the rebellion. All the Israelites who experienced the miraculous deliverance from Egypt, including the plagues and the parting of the Red Sea, were involved. Moses, as a type of Christ, was their leader and mediator, yet the people still faltered. This underscores the theme of unbelief despite witnessing God's power. The historical context of the Exodus is crucial, as it was a foundational event for Israel, symbolizing salvation and covenant relationship with God. The reference serves as a cautionary tale for the audience of Hebrews, urging them to remain steadfast in their faith and not repeat the mistakes of their ancestors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.

A slight change in the accentuation of the first Greek word effects a complete change in the sense: <span class= "ital">For who when they had heard did provoke? Nay, was it not all that came out of Egypt through Moses</span>? Those who were disobedient were the people whom God, through Moses, had but now delivered from bondage! The two exceptions (<a href="/numbers/14-30.htm" title="Doubtless you shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.">Numbers 14:30</a>) are left out of account in the presence of the multitude of rebels. There can be little doubt that the above translation (now generally received) presents the true meaning of the verse. It will be remembered that the oldest MSS. give no evidence on such points as accentuation, and therefore leave our judgment free. In modern times Bengel was the first to point out the true form of the Greek word; but one of the ancient versions (the Peschito-Syriac), and at least three of the Greek Fathers, are found to give the same interpretation. It will be seen at once that, with this arrangement of the words, the present verse is similar in structure to the two following.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For who, when they heard, provoked? Nay, did not all those who came out of Egypt by Moses</span>. That both these clauses are interrogative, and not as taken in the A.V., is now the prevalent view. The reasons for thus understanding them are <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the analogy of the two following verses, both of which are interrogative, and in the first of which a question is similarly answered by putting another; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the sense required. If the clauses were assertions, they could only be meant to express that the provocation was not universal, inasmuch as Joshua and Caleb (and it might be some few others) remained faithful. But to say this is unnecessary and irrelevant to the argument, the drift of which is to warn by "the example of unbelief;" and could <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span> ("some") possibly be used to denote the whole congregation with the exception of so few? It is to be observed, too, that the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> at the beginning of the second clause is a proper Greek expression (equivalent to "nay") in the case of one question being answered by another (cf. <a href="/luke/17-7.htm">Luke 17:7, 8</a>). This verse, then (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> retaining its usual sense of "for"), begins a proof, put in the form of a series of questions, of the preceding implied proposition, viz. that the retention of Christian privilege is dependent on perseverance, and that the privilege may be forfeited. In order to show this fully, the history of <a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>, referred to in the warning of the psalm, is examined in connection with the successive expressions of the warning; and it thus appears that all who came out of Egypt by Moses (the small exception of the faithful spies being disregarded) provoked God, and so forfeited their privilege, and that the cause of their failure was sin, disobedience, and, at the root of all, unbelief. The conclusion is obvious that, as their example is held out in the psalm as a warning to us, we may, all or any of us, similarly forfeit our higher calling. That the psalm is a warning to us, the rest it points to being the rest won for us by Christ, is more fully shown in the following chapter. We observe how the leading words in <a href="/psalms/95.htm">Psalm 95</a>. are taken in succession in the three successive verses <span class="accented">-</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 16, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 17, <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 18 - and how answers to the three questions suggested by these words are found in <a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>. - to the first, in vers. 2, 10, etc., "<span class="accented">all</span> the children of Israel," "all the congregation;" to the second, in vers. 29-34, with citation of the words used; to the third, in vers. 21-24. It is to be observed, further, that it is not simply <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, but its exhibition in actual sin and disobedience (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>), that is spoken of as calling forth the Divine wrath and the Divine oath. The second of the above words implies more titan "believed not" (as in the A.V.); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> differs from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in implying disobedience or contumacy. And this view of the case of the Israelites agrees entirely with the historical record, where an actual rebellion is spoken of a refusal to go on with the work they had been called to. It suits also the application to the case of the Hebrew Christians, among whom (as has been said) it was not only wavering of faith, but, as its consequence, remissness in moral duty and in the facing of trial, of which the writer of the Epistle had perceived symptoms, and on the ground of which he warns them to take heed lest growing indifference should be hardened into apostasy. But in both instances, as faith is the root of all virtue, so want of it was the cause, and again the growing result, of moral decadence. And so the argument is summed up in the concluding verse, <span class="cmt_word">And we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</span> <p>  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
