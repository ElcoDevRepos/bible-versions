The "good news" refers to the gospel, the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. In the context of Hebrews, the author is drawing a parallel between the recipients of the letter and the Israelites in the wilderness. The Israelites received the "good news" of God's promise of rest in the Promised Land. This connection emphasizes that the message of salvation and rest has been consistent throughout biblical history. The "we" refers to the early Christian community, indicating that they, like the Israelites, have received God's promises. This continuity underscores the faithfulness of God in delivering His message across generations.<p><b>but the message they heard was of no value to them,</b><br>The Israelites heard God's promises but failed to benefit from them due to their lack of faith. This serves as a warning to the readers of Hebrews about the dangers of unbelief. The historical context here is the Israelites' journey from Egypt to Canaan, where despite witnessing God's miracles, many did not trust in His promises. This phrase underscores the importance of not just hearing God's word but responding to it with faith. The message was "of no value" because it was not mixed with faith, highlighting the necessity of an active, trusting response to God's word.<p><b>since they did not share the faith of those who comprehended it.</b><br>This phrase points to the critical role of faith in receiving God's promises. The Israelites who failed to enter the Promised Land did not "share the faith" of those like Joshua and Caleb, who trusted in God's promise despite the challenges. This distinction between those who believed and those who did not is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing that faith is the key to experiencing God's rest and blessings. The reference to "those who comprehended it" suggests an understanding that goes beyond intellectual assent to a deep, trusting belief in God's promises. This concept is echoed in other parts of the New Testament, such as in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, which states that faith without works is dead, indicating that true faith results in action and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The original recipients of the "good news" in the Old Testament context, referring to the promise of entering God's rest, which they failed to achieve due to unbelief.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul or another early Christian leader, the author addresses Jewish Christians, encouraging them to remain steadfast in faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_christians.htm">The Early Christians</a></b><br>The audience of the letter, who are being warned not to repeat the mistakes of the Israelites by failing to combine the message with faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_rest.htm">The Promised Rest</a></b><br>A spiritual rest symbolized by the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land, representing salvation and eternal rest in God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_good_news.htm">The Good News (Gospel)</a></b><br>The message of salvation through Jesus Christ, which is available to all but effective only when combined with faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_faith.htm">The Necessity of Faith</a></b><br>Faith is essential for the gospel to be effective in our lives.

That the word of Moses and those associated with him in declaring God's promise (perhaps Aaron, Joshua, Caleb) might benefit the people, speakers and hearers must be united by the bond of faith. Here the margin of the Authorised version preserves the true text, following the Vulgate and the earliest of the printed Greek Testaments (the Complutensian).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For truly we have had good tidings</span> (or, <span class="accented">a gospel</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit them, not being mingled by faith with those that heard it</span>.
