In the context of the Old Testament, the sacrificial system required repeated offerings for sin (Leviticus 16). However, Jesus' single offering on the cross fulfills and surpasses these sacrifices (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>). This reflects the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>, where the suffering servant makes a single offering for sin. The concept of a single, all-sufficient sacrifice was revolutionary, contrasting with the continual sacrifices of the Levitical priesthood.<p><b>He has made perfect</b><br>The term "made perfect" refers to the complete and total efficacy of Christ's sacrifice in achieving what the law could not. In the Greek, "teleio&#333;" implies bringing to completion or fulfillment. This perfection is not about moral flawlessness but about being fully equipped and complete in standing before God. This connects to <a href="/hebrews/7-19.htm">Hebrews 7:19</a>, where the law made nothing perfect, but a better hope is introduced through Christ.<p><b>for all time</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the eternal nature of Christ's work. Unlike the temporary atonement provided by animal sacrifices, Jesus' sacrifice has everlasting effects. This aligns with the concept of the New Covenant prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises a lasting relationship with His people. The eternal aspect of Christ's sacrifice assures believers of their secure position in Him, as seen in <a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>, where Jesus speaks of giving eternal life to His followers.<p><b>those who are being sanctified</b><br>Sanctification is the process of being made holy, set apart for God's purposes. This ongoing process is a work of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>). The phrase indicates that while believers are positionally sanctified through Christ's sacrifice, they are also progressively being sanctified in their daily lives. This dual aspect of sanctification is seen in <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12-13</a>, where believers are called to work out their salvation as God works in them. The present participle "being sanctified" suggests a continuous action, highlighting the transformative journey of the Christian life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jesus is the one who offers Himself as the perfect sacrifice. His role as the High Priest and the sacrificial Lamb is crucial to understanding the passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offering.htm">The Offering</a></b><br>Refers to the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross. This single offering is contrasted with the repeated sacrifices of the Old Testament.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctified.htm">The Sanctified</a></b><br>Believers who are being made holy through the work of Christ.
