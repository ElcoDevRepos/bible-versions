The "fathers" are the ancestors of the Jewish people who repeatedly tested God's patience and faithfulness. This testing is documented in several instances, such as at Massah and Meribah (<a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>, <a href="/numbers/20-2.htm">Numbers 20:2-13</a>), where the Israelites doubted God's provision and presence. The testing and trying of God reflect a lack of faith and trust, despite the numerous miracles they witnessed. This behavior is a warning to the readers of Hebrews to avoid similar unbelief and disobedience.<p><b>and for forty years saw My works</b><br>The "forty years" refers to the period the Israelites spent wandering in the desert, a direct result of their disobedience and lack of faith (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>). During this time, they witnessed God's miraculous works, including the provision of manna (Exodus 16), water from the rock (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>), and the guidance of the pillar of cloud and fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). Despite these continuous signs of God's power and care, the Israelites' persistent unbelief led to their exclusion from entering the Promised Land. This serves as a typology of Christ, who provides spiritual sustenance and guidance, urging believers to remain faithful and obedient to enter the ultimate rest promised by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fathers.htm">The Fathers</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who were led by Moses out of Egypt and wandered in the wilderness for forty years.

The change of reading is more interesting than important, as the sense is not materially different. Both here and in the original passage it seems probable that the "work," or "works," should be understood of the divine judgments which the disobedient people "saw" and bore during forty years. In the Psalm (and apparently in <a href="/hebrews/3-17.htm" title="But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?">Hebrews 3:17</a> of this chapter) the mention of the forty years connects itself with the words which follow; but here with the provocations of the people and their punishment. It is held by many that in this period of forty years is contained a reference to the time that intervened between our Saviour's earthly ministry and the destruction of Jerusalem; and a Jewish tradition is quoted which assigns to "the days of Messiah" a duration of forty years.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/3-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">where</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;</span> <span class="translit">(hou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3757.htm">Strong's 3757: </a> </span><span class="str2">Where, whither, when, in what place.
