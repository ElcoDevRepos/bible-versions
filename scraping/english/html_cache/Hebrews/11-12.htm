His story begins in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a> when God calls him to leave his homeland and promises to make him a great nation. Abraham's significance is highlighted in the New Testament as an example of faith and obedience. His journey from Ur of the Chaldeans to Canaan is a pivotal moment in biblical history, marking the beginning of God's covenant with the Israelites.<p><b>and he as good as dead</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Abraham's advanced age and the seeming impossibility of him fathering a child. At the time of Isaac's birth, Abraham was 100 years old, and Sarah was 90, well beyond the natural age for childbearing. This highlights the miraculous nature of Isaac's birth, demonstrating God's power to fulfill His promises despite human limitations. It also serves as a testament to Abraham's faith, as he believed God's promise against all odds.<p><b>came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky</b><br>This imagery is part of God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>, where God tells him to look at the stars and count them, if possible, as a representation of his future offspring. This promise is reiterated in <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>. The stars symbolize the vastness and innumerability of Abraham's descendants, which include not only the physical nation of Israel but also all who share in the faith of Abraham, as explained in <a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>.<p><b>and as countless as the sand on the seashore</b><br>This phrase further emphasizes the vast number of Abraham's descendants, echoing the promise in <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>. The sand on the seashore is a common biblical metaphor for an innumerable multitude, used to convey the idea of abundance and blessing. This promise finds its ultimate fulfillment in the spiritual descendants of Abraham, those who are part of the covenant through faith in Jesus Christ, as discussed in <a href="/romans/4-16.htm">Romans 4:16-18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, whose faith is highlighted in <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>.
