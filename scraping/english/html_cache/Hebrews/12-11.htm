This phrase acknowledges the immediate discomfort and suffering that discipline can bring. The Greek word for "discipline" here is "paideia," which encompasses education, training, and correction. Historically, discipline was a common part of education in the Greco-Roman world, where it was understood as necessary for growth and maturity. The pain associated with discipline is not just physical but can also be emotional or spiritual, reflecting the refining process that believers undergo. This concept is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>, where the Lord's discipline is described as an expression of His love.<p><b>Later on, however, it yields a harvest of righteousness and peace</b><br>The phrase "later on" suggests a future benefit that comes from enduring discipline. The "harvest" metaphor is agricultural, indicating a process that takes time and patience. In biblical times, harvests were crucial for survival, symbolizing abundance and blessing. Righteousness here refers to a right standing with God and living in accordance with His will. Peace is the inner tranquility and harmony that comes from being aligned with God's purposes. This outcome of discipline is consistent with the fruit of the Spirit described in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, where righteousness and peace are part of the believer's character development.<p><b>to those who have been trained by it.</b><br>The word "trained" is derived from the Greek "gymnazo," which is related to physical training and exercise. This implies a rigorous and intentional process, much like an athlete preparing for competition. In the cultural context of the New Testament, physical training was highly valued, and the metaphor would resonate with the original audience. The training aspect emphasizes that discipline is not a one-time event but an ongoing process that shapes and molds the believer. This aligns with <a href="/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7-8</a>, where spiritual training is compared to physical training, highlighting its eternal value. The passage underscores the transformative power of God's discipline in producing mature and faithful followers of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

When the verse says, &#8220;No discipline seems enjoyable at the time,&#8221; it speaks plainly to the way correction feels in real life&#8212;never pleasant in the moment. Consider:<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a> underscores the same truth: &#8220;My son, do not despise the LORD&#8217;s discipline&#8230; for the LORD disciplines the one He loves.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/3-19.htm">Revelation 3:19</a> echoes it: &#8220;Those I love, I rebuke and discipline.&#8221;<p>In each instance, Scripture treats God&#8217;s discipline as a present reality, not an allegory.

But there is more than rest after conflict, for the object of the conflict is attained; the fruit consists in righteousness. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/32-17.htm" title="And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.">Isaiah 32:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-30.htm" title="The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that wins souls is wise.">Proverbs 11:30</a>; <a href="/james/3-17.htm" title="But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.">James 3:17</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-11.htm" title="Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.">Philippians 1:11</a>.)

"<span class="accented">Of</span> righteousness" is a genitive of apposition; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> is the peaceable fruit yielded by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. And the word here surely denotes actual righteousness in ourselves; not merely justification in what is called the forensic sense: the proper effect of chastening is to make us good, and so at peace with our own conscience and with God. It is by no means thus implied that we can be accepted and so have peace <span class="accented">on the ground</span> of our own imperfect righteousness; only that it is in the fruits of faith perfected by discipline that we may "know that we are of the truth, and assure our hearts before him" (cf. <a href="/james/3-18.htm">James 3:18</a>, "The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace;" also <a href="/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>, "And the work of righteousness shall be peace"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/12-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;</span> <span class="translit">(ou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
