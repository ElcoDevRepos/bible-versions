In the context of Hebrews, the audience is encouraged to look away from distractions and challenges, and instead concentrate on Jesus as the ultimate example of faithfulness. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of looking to God for guidance and strength, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/121.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a>, where the psalmist lifts their eyes to the hills, seeking help from the Lord.<p><b>the author and perfecter of our faith</b><br>Jesus is described as both the originator and the completer of faith. As the "author," He initiates faith in believers, and as the "perfecter," He brings it to completion. This dual role underscores His divine nature and His work in salvation history. The concept of Jesus as the "author" connects to <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, where Jesus is the Word through whom all things were made. As the "perfecter," it reflects <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, which assures believers that God will complete the good work He began in them.<p><b>who for the joy set before Him</b><br>This phrase highlights Jesus' motivation in enduring the cross. The "joy" refers to the anticipated outcome of His sacrificial work, including the redemption of humanity and His exaltation. This forward-looking perspective is a model for believers to endure trials with the hope of future glory, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>, which speaks of present sufferings not being worth comparing with the glory to be revealed.<p><b>endured the cross</b><br>The cross was a method of execution reserved for the most heinous criminals, symbolizing extreme suffering and humiliation. Jesus' endurance of the cross demonstrates His obedience and love, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describes the suffering servant. This endurance is a call for believers to persevere in their own trials, as Jesus did.<p><b>scorning its shame</b><br>Crucifixion was not only physically painful but also socially disgraceful. Jesus' scorn of the shame associated with the cross indicates His disregard for worldly honor in favor of divine purpose. This reflects the biblical theme of God using what is foolish in the world to shame the wise (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>), and it encourages believers to value God's approval over human opinion.<p><b>and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God</b><br>This phrase signifies Jesus' exaltation and authority following His resurrection and ascension. Sitting at the right hand of God is a position of honor and power, fulfilling the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>. It indicates the completion of His redemptive work and His ongoing intercession for believers, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>. This position assures believers of Jesus' sovereignty and the ultimate victory of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, referred to as the "author and perfecter of our faith."

The first word is very similar to that of <a href="/hebrews/11-26.htm" title="Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward.">Hebrews 11:26</a>; the runner looks away from all other objects and fixes his gaze on One.

As the last verse spoke of our "patient endurance," this speaks of our faith, and of this Jesus is the Author and the Perfecter. The former word has occurred before, in <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>; and here, as there, <span class= "ital">origination</span> is the principal thought. There the idea of leading the way was also present; but here "Author" stands in contrast with "Perfecter," and the example of our Lord is the subject of the clause which follows. Because it is He who begins and brings to perfection our faith, we must run the race with our eye fixed upon Him: in Him is the beginning, in Him the completion of the promises (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="For all the promises of God in him are yes, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.">2Corinthians 1:20</a>); and in the steady and trustful dependence upon Him which this figure describes consists our faith.<p><span class= "bld">Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross.</span>--The literal meaning is very forcible, <span class= "ital">endured a cross, despising shame;</span> the shame of such a death being set over against the joy that lay before Him.

It is no valid objection to this view that he could not have been a Leader in this sense to the faithful ones before his coming, referred to in the last chapter; for, as has been before observed (see on "the reproach of Christ," <a href="/hebrews/11-26.htm">Hebrews 11:26</a>), he is regarded as the Head and Leader, in all ages, of the faithful; and in virtue of his future warfare for mankind the saints of old endured and triumphed: - and certainly Christians, to whom the exhortation is addressed, may look to him in an obvious sense as their Captain to be followed. Nor, again, is there difficulty - apart from that of the whole mystery of the Incarnation - in his being presented to us as himself an example of triumphant faith. For he is elsewhere spoken of as having so "emptied himself" of his Divine glory as to have become like unto us in all things, sin except; and thus to have been sustained during his human life by faith in the unseen, as we are. His addresses to the Father (see especially <a href="/john/17.htm">John 17</a>.) are strikingly significant in this regard. The expression, "for the joy," etc. (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>), does not mean, as some take it, "instead <span class="accented">of</span> the joy which he might have had on earth" (such e.g. as was offered to him by the tempter), but, as is evident from the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "as set against, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the sake of, future joy" (cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 16). Such looking forward to joy with the Father and the redeemed after triumph is expressed in the great intercessory prayer-above referred to (<a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5, 13, 22, 23, 24, 26</a>). It may be here observed that anticipation of reward hereafter is among legitimate human motives to a good life. It may be said, indeed, that the highest virtue consists in doing what is right simply because it is right - in fulfilling God's will, whatever may come of it to ourselves; but the hope of a final happy issue comes properly, and indeed inevitably, in as an inspiring and sustaining motive. Aspiration after Happiness is a God-given instinct of humanity, necessary for keeping up the life of virtue. There may be some so in love with virtue as to be capable of persevering in lifelong self-denial, though without any faith in a life to come. But human nature in general certainly requires this further incentive, and Christian faith supplies it. Nor are those who thus work with a view to future joy to be accused of selfish motives, as though they balanced only a greater against a smaller gain. To the true Christian the grand inspiring principle is still the love of God and of his neighbor, and of goodness for its own sake, though the hope of an eternal reward supports and cheers him mightily. Nor, again, is the joy looked forward to a selfish joy. It is the joy of sharing in the triumph of eternal righteousness in company with all the redeemed, whose salvation, no less than his own, he desires and strives for. And, further, with regard to his own individual joy, what is it but the joy of attaining the end of his being, the perfection God meant him for, and to which it is his duty to aspire? Hence Christ would not have been a perfect Example to man had he not been represented as looking forward to "the joy that was set before him." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/12-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Let us fix our eyes</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(aphor&#333;ntes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_872.htm">Strong's 872: </a> </span><span class="str2">To look away from (something else) to, see distinctly.
