This chapter lists numerous figures from the Old Testament who exemplified faith in God. The "great cloud of witnesses" refers to these individuals, such as Abel, Noah, Abraham, and Moses, who serve as examples and testimonies of living by faith. The imagery of a "cloud" suggests a vast, encompassing presence, indicating that these witnesses are not passive observers but active encouragers of the faith journey. This metaphor may also evoke the image of a stadium filled with spectators, drawing from the Greco-Roman context of athletic competitions.<p><b>let us throw off every encumbrance and the sin that so easily entangles</b><br>The phrase "throw off" implies a deliberate and decisive action to remove anything that hinders spiritual progress. "Encumbrance" can refer to any weight or burden that slows us down, not necessarily sinful in itself but detrimental to our spiritual race. The "sin that so easily entangles" suggests specific sins that are particularly ensnaring or habitual, which can impede our relationship with God. The imagery of entanglement evokes the idea of being trapped or hindered, much like a runner caught in a net. This call to action emphasizes the need for vigilance and self-discipline in the Christian life, echoing Paul's exhortations in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>.<p><b>and let us run with endurance the race set out for us</b><br>The metaphor of a race is a common New Testament illustration of the Christian life, emphasizing perseverance, discipline, and focus. The word "endurance" highlights the necessity of steadfastness and resilience in the face of trials and challenges. The "race set out for us" suggests a divinely appointed path, unique to each believer, yet part of a larger, communal journey of faith. This imagery aligns with Paul's teachings in <a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13-14</a>, where he speaks of pressing on toward the goal. The race is not a sprint but a marathon, requiring sustained effort and reliance on God's strength.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cloud_of_witnesses.htm">Cloud of Witnesses</a></b><br>This refers to the faithful individuals mentioned in <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, often called the "Hall of Faith."

(In so difficult a verse as this we need an exactness of translation which might not otherwise be desirable.) It is plain that the chief thought is, "Let us run our race with patient endurance, looking unto Jesus the Author . . . of our faith;" so that here again we have the thought which the writer is never weary of enforcing, the need of faith and patience for all who would inherit the promises. The connection is chiefly with the last verses of Hebrews 11, which are, indeed, a summary of the whole chapter. The purpose of God has been that those who throughout the past ages obtained witness of Him through their faith should not reach their consummation apart from us. To that consummation, then, let us press forward. Present to us in the view of Christ's accomplished sacrifice, it is all future in regard of personal attainment. As those who have preceded us reached the goal, each one for himself, by faith and patient endurance, so must we. The thought of persevering effort crowned by a recompence of reward (<a href="/hebrews/6-12.htm" title="That you be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.">Hebrews 6:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm" title="That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us:">Hebrews 6:18</a>; <a href="/context/hebrews/10-35.htm" title="Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward.">Hebrews 10:35-39</a>) very naturally suggested the imagery of the public games (by this time familiar even to Jews), to which St. Paul in his Epistles so frequently alludes. (See <a href="/1_corinthians/4-9.htm" title="For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.">1Corinthians 4:9</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-24.htm" title="Know you not that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain.">1Corinthians 9:24-27</a>; <a href="/context/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Philippians 3:12-14</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1Timothy 6:12</a>; <a href="/context/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2Timothy 4:7-8</a>; comp. <a href="/context/hebrews/10-32.htm" title="But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;">Hebrews 10:32-33</a>.) In these passages are called up the various associations of the great national festivals of Greece--the severe discipline of the competitors, the intenseness of the struggle, the rewards, "the righteous judge," the crowd of spectators. Most of these thoughts are present here (<a href="/context/hebrews/12-1.htm" title="Why seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,">Hebrews 12:1-2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-4.htm" title="You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.">Hebrews 12:4</a>), and new joints of comparison are added, so that the scene is brought vividly before our eyes. It has been often supposed that the word "witnesses" is used in the sense of <span class= "ital">spectators</span> of the race. To an English reader this idea is very natural (as "witnesses" may simply mean <span class= "ital">beholders</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but there is no such ambiguity in the Greek word (<span class= "ital">martyres</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The Greek fathers rightly understood it to signify those who bear witness, and the chief point of doubt seems to have been whether the sense is general, or whether the word bears its later meaning--<span class= "ital">martyrs, </span>who have borne testimony with their blood. Those who thus encompass us, a countless "host (a "cloud" of witnesses), have had witness borne to them through their faith, and in turn stand forth <span class= "ital">as</span> witnesses to faith, bearing testimony to its power and works. One and all 'they offer encouragement to us in our own contest of faith, and for this reason they are mentioned here. That the idea of the presence of spectators may be contained in the other words, "compassed about with so great a cloud," is very possible; but no interpretation must be allowed to interfere with the chief thought--that the runner's steadfast gaze is fixed on Him who has Himself traversed the course before us, and is now the Judge and Rewarder. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/12-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#959;&#953;&#947;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Toigaroun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5105.htm">Strong's 5105: </a> </span><span class="str2">Consequently, therefore, well then, so then.
