This curtain was a significant barrier, symbolizing the separation between God and humanity due to sin. Only the high priest could pass through this veil, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), as described in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>. The tearing of the temple veil at the moment of Jesus' death (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>) signifies the removal of this barrier, granting believers direct access to God through Christ.<p><b>was a room</b><br>The "room" mentioned here is the innermost part of the tabernacle, known as the Most Holy Place or the Holy of Holies. This was the most sacred area, where God's presence was believed to dwell above the Ark of the Covenant. The design and dimensions of this room were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 25-27), emphasizing its divine significance and the care required in its construction and use.<p><b>called the Most Holy Place</b><br>The "Most Holy Place" was the central and most sacred area of the tabernacle and later the temple. It housed the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and a jar of manna (<a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>). This room represented the throne room of God on earth, where His presence was most intensely felt. The high priest's annual entry into this space foreshadowed Christ's ultimate sacrifice and His role as our eternal High Priest, who entered the heavenly sanctuary once for all (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).
