The testing of Abraham is a pivotal moment in biblical history, reflecting the trials believers may face. The test refers to the command from God to sacrifice his son Isaac, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>. This event is a profound example of faith and obedience, as Abraham trusted God's promise despite the seemingly contradictory command. The testing of faith is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in the lives of Job, Joseph, and others, emphasizing that faith often requires trust beyond human understanding.<p><b>offered up Isaac on the altar.</b><br>Abraham's willingness to offer Isaac is a demonstration of his complete trust in God. The altar, a place of sacrifice, symbolizes submission and worship. This act prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who was offered for the sins of the world. The location, Mount Moriah, is traditionally associated with the future site of the Temple in Jerusalem, linking this event to the sacrificial system established in the Law of Moses. Abraham's action is a type of Christ's sacrifice, illustrating the concept of substitutionary atonement.<p><b>He who had received the promises</b><br>Abraham had received promises from God, including the promise of numerous descendants and that through his offspring all nations would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3, 15</a>:5). These promises were foundational to the Abrahamic Covenant, which is central to the narrative of the Old Testament and the unfolding plan of redemption. The promises were not just for physical descendants but pointed to the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, through whom the ultimate blessing would come.<p><b>was ready to offer his one and only son,</b><br>Isaac is referred to as Abraham's "one and only son," emphasizing the uniqueness and preciousness of the sacrifice. Although Abraham had another son, Ishmael, Isaac was the child of promise, born to Sarah in her old age as a result of God's miraculous intervention. This phrase underscores the depth of Abraham's faith, as he was willing to give up what was most dear to him. It also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of God the Father offering His one and only Son, Jesus, for the salvation of humanity (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).

The following word is in the Greek "<span class= "ital">hath</span> offered up Isaac," and several other examples of a similar peculiarity will present themselves in this chapter. As in former cases (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm" title="There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.">Hebrews 4:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-11.htm" title="If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?">Hebrews 7:11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-9.htm" title="Then said he, See, I come to do your will, O God. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.">Hebrews 10:9</a>) the reference is to the permanent record of Scripture, in which the fact related is ever present. Abraham stands before us there as having offered his son. It will be seen that the offering is spoken of as if consummated. As regards faith the sacrifice was indeed complete; the perfect surrender of will had been made, and the hand was stretched out for the deed.<p><span class= "bld">And he that had received the promises offered up.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">and he that had welcomed</span> (gladly accepted) <span class= "ital">the promises was offering up.</span> From the figurative accomplishment of the deed the writer passes to the historical narrative; hence we read, "he . . . was (in the act of) offering."

For, in ver. 18, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;</span> is more naturally connected with the immediate antecedent, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, than with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;</span>: and, in ver. 19, there is no need to supply "him" after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>: the Greek seems obviously to express belief in God's general power to raise from the dead, not his power in that instance only. The offering of Isaac (specially instanced also by St. James, if. 21), stands out as the crowning instance of Abraham's faith. The very son, so king expected, and at length, as it were, supernaturally given, - he in whose single life was bound up all hope of fulfillment of the promise, was to be sacrificed after all, and so seemingly all hope cut off. Yet Abraham is represented as not hesitating for a moment to do in simple faith what seemed God's will, and still not wavering in his hope of a fulfillment somehow. Such faith is here regarded as virtually faith in God's power even to raise the dead. (For a similar view of Abraham's faith as representing "the hope and resurrection of the dead," comp. <a href="/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17, 24</a>.) The expression, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called" (literally, "In Isaac shall be called to thee a seed"), quoted from <a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>, means, not that the seed should be called after the name of Isaac, but that the seed to be called Abraham's should be in Isaac, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his issue. The concluding phrase, "Whence also he received him in a figure" (literally, "in a <span class="accented">parable</span>," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>), has been variously interpreted. Notwithstanding the authority of many modern common-taters, we may certainly reject the view of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span> carrying here the sense borne by the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, that of venturing or exposing one's self to risk, or that of the adverb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, unexpectedly. Even if the noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span> could be shown by any instance to bear such senses, its ordinary use in the New Testament as well as in the LXX. must surely be understood here. It expresses (under the idea of comparison, or setting one thing by the side of another) an illustration, representation, or figure of something. Its use in this sense in the Gospels is familiar to us all; elsewhere in the New Testament it occurs only in this Epistle, <a href="/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>, where the "first taber<span class="accented">nacle"</span> is spoken of as a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>. Still, the question remains of the exact drift of this expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>. It surely is, that, though Isaac did not really die, but only the ram in his stead, yet the transaction represented to Abraham an actual winning of iris son from the dead; he did so win him in the way of an acted parable, which confirmed his faith in God's power to raise the dead as much as if the lad had died. For such use of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> we may compare <a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which may mean (notwithstanding the different view of it given doubtfully by the distinguished commentator on the Epistle in the 'Speaker's Commentary'), "We see, not actually, but in the way of an enigmatical representation, as through a mirror." The above seems a mere natural meaning of the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>, than that of the commentators who interpret it "in such sort as to be a parable or type of something else to crone," viz. of the death and resurrection of Christ. It does not, of course, follow that the transaction was not typical of Christ, or that the writer does net so regard it; we are only considering what his language fit itself implies. Rendered literally, and with retention of the order of the words, the sentence runs: "From whence [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the dead] him [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Isaac, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> being slightly emphatic, as is shown by its position in the sentence, equivalent to <span class="accented">illum</span>, not <span class="accented">eum</span>; and this suitably after the general proposition preceding] he did too in a parable win [<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">sibi acquisivit</span>; cf. ver. 39, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>]." With regard to what we may call the moral aspect of this peculiar trial of Abraham's faith, a few words may be said, since a difficulty naturally suggests itself on the subject. How, it may be asked, is it consistent with our ideas of Divine righteousness, that even readiness to slay his son should be required of Abraham as a duty? How are we to account for this apparent sanction of the principle of human sacrifices? To the latter question we may reply, in the first place, that the narrative in Genesis, taken as a whole, affords no such sanction, but very much the contrary. All we are told is that the great patriarch, in the course of his religious training, was once divinely led to suppose such a sacrifice to be required of him. The offering of sons was not unusual in the ancient races among where Abraham lived; and, however shocking such a practice might be, and however condemned in later Scripture, it was due, we may say. to the perversion only of a true instinct of humanity - that which suggests the need of some great atonement, and the claim of the Giver of all to our best and dearest, if demanded from us. That Abraham should be even divinely led to suppose for a time that his God required him to express his acknowledgment of this need and this claim by not withholding from him as much as even the heathen were accustomed to offer to their gods, is consistent with God's general way of educating men to a full knowledge of the truth. But the sacrifice was ill the end emphatically forbidden by a voice from heaven; to Abraham thenceforth, and to his seed for ever, it was made dearly known that, though God does require atonement for sin and entire submission to his will, he does not require violence to be done to tender human feeling, or any cruel rites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/11-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">By faith</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Pistei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4102.htm">Strong's 4102: </a> </span><span class="str2">Faith, belief, trust, confidence; fidelity, faithfulness. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Abraham,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#946;&#961;&#945;&#8048;&#956;</span> <span class="translit">(Abraam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_11.htm">Strong's 11: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abraham, progenitor of the Hebrew race.
