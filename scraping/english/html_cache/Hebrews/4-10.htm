It echoes the promise of rest given to the Israelites in the Old Testament, particularly in the context of the Promised Land (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-9.htm">Deuteronomy 12:9-10</a>). However, the rest mentioned here is not merely physical or geographical but spiritual and eternal. It signifies a cessation from striving for salvation through works, aligning with the New Testament teaching of salvation by grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). This rest is a foretaste of the eternal rest believers will experience in heaven (<a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>).<p><b>also rests from his own work</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the cessation of human effort in achieving righteousness. In the cultural context of the Jewish audience, this would contrast with the works-based righteousness of the Mosaic Law. Theologically, it underscores the doctrine of justification by faith, where believers cease from their own works as a means of earning salvation and instead rely on the finished work of Christ on the cross (<a href="/romans/4-5.htm">Romans 4:5</a>). This rest is a spiritual state of peace and assurance in one's relationship with God.<p><b>just as God did from His</b><br>This phrase draws a parallel between the believer's rest and God's rest after creation. In <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>, God rested on the seventh day, not because He was weary, but to set a pattern for humanity and to signify the completion of His creative work. This rest is a type of the ultimate rest believers find in Christ. It also connects to the Sabbath rest, which was a shadow of the rest to come in Christ (<a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-17</a>). Theologically, it points to the sufficiency and completeness of God's work, mirrored in the believer's rest in the sufficiency of Christ's atoning sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who rested on the seventh day after completing the work of creation, setting a pattern for rest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those who are invited to enter into God's rest through faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The event where God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh, establishing the concept of rest.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath.htm">Sabbath</a></b><br>The day of rest instituted by God, symbolizing the rest believers can enter through faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The fulfillment of the promise of rest, offering spiritual rest to believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_rest.htm">Understanding God's Rest</a></b><br>God's rest is not merely physical cessation from labor but a spiritual state of peace and fulfillment in Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_as_the_key_to_rest.htm">Faith as the Key to Rest</a></b><br>Entering God's rest requires faith in Jesus Christ, who provides the ultimate rest for our souls.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/imitating_god's_pattern.htm">Imitating God's Pattern</a></b><br>Just as God rested from His work, believers are called to rest from striving and trust in God's completed work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sabbath_as_a_foreshadow.htm">The Sabbath as a Foreshadow</a></b><br>The Sabbath rest in the Old Testament points to the deeper, spiritual rest available in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_rest_today.htm">Living in Rest Today</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to live in the reality of God's rest daily, experiencing His peace and presence.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_4_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 4:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_enter_God_s_rest_today.htm">How can we enter God's rest as described in Hebrews 4:10 today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_ceased_from_his_own_work.htm">What does "ceased from his own work" mean in Hebrews 4:10?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Hebrews_4_10_to_Genesis_2_2_rest.htm">How does Hebrews 4:10 connect with the creation rest in Genesis 2:2?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_emulate_God_s_rest.htm">In what ways can we strive to emulate God's rest in our lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_faith_in_God_end_our_efforts.htm">How does trusting God help us cease from our own works?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_entering_God_s_rest.htm">What does Hebrews 4:10 mean by entering God's rest?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_4_10_and_Sabbath_rest_link.htm">How does Hebrews 4:10 relate to the concept of Sabbath rest?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Is_Hebrews_4_10_against_works_for_salvation.htm">Does Hebrews 4:10 imply that works are unnecessary for salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_hebrews_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Hebrews 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_christ_dwelling_in_us.htm">What did God do on day seven?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_day_of_rest.htm">What defines a day of rest?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_quietism.htm">What is Quietism?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_do_believers_enter_god's_rest_amid_turmoil.htm">From Hebrews 4:1-3, how can we reconcile the promise of 'entering his rest' when believers throughout history still face turmoil, suffering, and unrest?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Hebrews 4:10 Mean</div><b>For whoever enters God&#8217;s rest</b><p>- &#8220;For whoever enters God&#8217;s rest&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-10.htm">Hebrews 4:10</a>) opens the door wide.

Freed from self-effort, we serve out of gratitude, anticipating the full and final Sabbath with Him forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Into his rest.</span>--That is, <span class= "ital">into God's rest.</span><p><span class= "bld">Hath ceased.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">hath rested from his works as God did from His own</span> (works). This verse is added to explain and justify the reference to a "sabbath" in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm" title="There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.">Hebrews 4:9</a>. Man's sabbath-rest begins when he enters into God's rest (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm" title="And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.">Genesis 2:2</a>); as that was the goal of the creative work, so to the people of God this rest is the goal of their life of "works."<p>As the whole argument is reviewed, the question may naturally be asked, To what extent is this wide meaning present in the Psalm itself? Where must the line be drawn between the direct teaching of the words and the application here made? The apparent expansion of the meaning of the Psalm relates to <a href="/hebrews/4-11.htm" title="Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.">Hebrews 4:11</a> alone. There, in the first instance, an historical fact is mentioned--the exclusion of the rebels from the promised land. But though the mention of the oath of God is derived from <a href="/context/numbers/14-28.htm" title="Say to them, As truly as I live, said the LORD, as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:">Numbers 14:28-30</a>, the language of the historian is significantly changed; for "ye shall not come into the land," we read, "they shall not enter into My rest." True, the land could be spoken of as their "rest and inheritance" (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-9.htm" title="For you are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God gives you.">Deuteronomy 12:9</a>); but the language which the Psalmist chooses is at all events susceptible of a much higher and wider meaning, and (as some of the passages quoted in the Note on <a href="/hebrews/3-11.htm" title="So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)">Hebrews 3:11</a> serve to prove) may have been used in this extended sense long before the Psalmist's age. That <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm" title="For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.">Hebrews 4:8</a>, when placed by the side of <a href="/hebrews/4-11.htm" title="Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.">Hebrews 4:11</a>, shows the higher meaning of the words to have been in the Psalmist's thought, and implies that the offer of admission to the rest of God was still made, it seems unreasonable to doubt. As the people learnt through ages of experience and training (see <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm" title="For to which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?">Hebrews 1:5</a>) to discern the deeper and more spiritual meaning that lay in the promises of the King and the Son of David, so was it with other promises which at first might seem to have no more than a temporal significance. If these considerations are well founded, it follows that we have no right to look on the argument of this section as an "accommodation" or a mere application of Scripture: the Christian preacher does but fill up the outline which the prophet had drawn. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he that is entered into his rest</span> (God's, as before) <span class="cmt_word">hath himself also rested from his works, as from his own God</span>. There are two ways of understanding this verse. Its general intention is, indeed, clear. It accounts for the use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> which precedes, expressing that the true meaning of "God's rest" is not satisfied by any earthly rest, but only by one like his. The question is whether the verse is to be taken as a general proposition or as referring specifically to Christ. In favor of the latter view is the aorist <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. The <span class="accented">literal</span> translation would be "He that entered... himself also <span class="accented">rested."</span> Ebrard, on this ground, strenuously defends the reference to Christ; and also on the ground of parallelism with <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a> in the first division of the general argument. In the first division (<a href="/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>.) the course of thought was - Dominion over creation has been assigned to man: man has not attained it: Jesus has; and in Jesus man fulfils his destiny. In this second division the corresponding course of drought is - God's rest has been offered to man: man has not attained it: Jesus has; and in Jesus man may enter it. And thus (as has been explained above) the conclusion that Jesus is the High Priest of humanity is led up to by two parallel lines of argument. But the third of the propositions of the second line of argument (corresponding to <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a> in the first) is not distinctly expressed unless it be in the verse before us; and therefore this verse, on this ground as well as that of the use of the aorist, is taken to refer to Christ. On the other hand, it is argued (Bleek, Do Wette, Delitzsch, etc.) that, if a specific reference to Christ had been intended, he would have been mentioned, so as to make the meaning clear; and secondly, that the aorist <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> is legitimate, though the proposition be a general one. Delitzsch explains it thus: "The author might have written <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> or (more classically) <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: but he has taken up into the main proposition the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, which properly belongs (according to <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>) to the clause of comparison: whosoever has entered God's rest, of him the '<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> holds good in the same manner as of God." And, further, it is to be observed that the Greek aorist may sometimes be put for the present, "to express an action completely determined, every doubt as to its truth and unalterableness being removed" (Matthiae, 'Gr. Gram.,' &sect; 506). In this instance the idea might be - he that has entered into God's rest rested, when he so entered, from all his works, etc. On the whole, it appears that specific reference to Christ is <span class="accented">not</span> apparent from the immediate context, or required by the mere language used. Still, in consideration of the general argument, we may take the writer to have meant his readers to understand that it was Christ who <span class="accented">had</span> so entered the rest of God, so as to lead God's people into it. That this is so appears from ver. 14, <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x37e;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>, which seems to require that preceding link of thought. - Among man's deepest feelings is a longing for rest. Haply in the freshness and ardor of early life not deeply felt, it recurs from time to time, and grows stronger with advancing years. Nothing in life fully satisfies this longing. Labors, distresses, disappointments, anxieties, never allow the desired repose. Few there are whose hearts have not sometimes echoed the psalmist's words, "Oh that I had wings like a dove! For then would I flee away, and be at rest!" Many since Job have felt something of his longing to be where "the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest." Is there to be no satisfaction ever of this deep human craving? Holy Scripture meets it as it meets all others. It spoke of a rest of God above creation from the beginning of time; it intimated man's part and interest in it by the weekly sabbath which he was to keep with God. But this was, after all, but a symbol and earnest of something unattained. At length a fuller realization of the longed-for rest was held out to the chosen people, and the Promised Land was pictured beforehand in the colors of an earthly Paradise. Forfeited, when first offered, through the people's unworthiness (representing by an historical parable the bar to man's entrance into the eternal rest), it was attained at last. But the true rest still came not. Canaan, like the sabbath, proved but a symbol of something unattained. Yet the old longing for rest went on, and inspired men went on proclaiming it as attainable and still to come. The irrepressible craving, the suggestive symbols, the prophetic anticipations, are all fulfilled in Christ. He, when he had passed with us through this earthly scene of labor, entered, with our nature, into that eternal rest of God, to prepare a place for us, having by his atonement removed the bar to human entrance. Through our faith in him we are assured that our deep-seated craving for satisfaction unattained as yet, which we express by the term "<span class="accented">rest</span>," is a true inward prophecy, and that, though we find it not <span class="accented">here</span>, we may through him, if we are faithful, confidently expect it <span class="accented">there</span>, where "<span class="accented">beyond</span> these voices there is peace." There now follows (vers. 11-14) a renewal of the warning of <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-4:1</a>, urged now with increased force in view of the danger of slighting such a revelation as the gospel has been shown to be; after which (ver. 14, etc.) come words of encouragement, based on the view, now a second time arrived at, of Christ being our great High Priest. And thus the exposition of his priesthood, which follows in <a href="/hebrews/5.htm">Hebrews 5</a>, is led up to. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
