The concept of faithfulness is central to the character of Jesus, as seen throughout the New Testament. In <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>, Jesus states, "For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me." This underscores His obedience and commitment to fulfilling the mission given by the Father. The term "appointed" suggests a divine commissioning, similar to the Old Testament prophets and leaders who were chosen by God for specific purposes. Jesus' faithfulness is a model for believers, emphasizing the importance of obedience and dedication to God's calling.<p><b>just as Moses was faithful in all God&#8217;s house</b><br>Moses is presented as a type of Christ, serving as a faithful servant in God's house, which refers to the people of Israel. <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a> states, "My servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house." This comparison elevates the status of Jesus, showing that while Moses was a servant, Jesus is the Son over God's house (<a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>). The "house" here symbolizes the community of believers, both in the Old Covenant with Israel and the New Covenant with the Church. Moses' faithfulness involved leading the Israelites out of Egypt, receiving the Law, and guiding them through the wilderness, all of which prefigure Christ's redemptive work. The cultural context of Moses' leadership during the Exodus is foundational for understanding the Jewish heritage and the continuity of God's plan through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, recognized as the Son of God and the Savior.

His fidelity is not abstract; it is proven in real time, under real pressure.<p>- For believers, this sets a pattern: &#8220;Be imitators of God&#8230; and walk in love, just as Christ loved us&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the One who appointed Him</b><p>- The Father &#8220;appointed&#8221; or commissioned the Son for the mission of redemption. <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a> speaks of Jesus being &#8220;delivered up by God&#8217;s set plan and foreknowledge.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21</a> records Jesus saying, &#8220;As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.&#8221; The appointment language emphasizes divine authority; the Son&#8217;s work is God-initiated, God-approved, and God-empowered.<p>- This reminds the reader that Jesus did not seize glory on His own terms. <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a> describes Him humbly submitting to the Father&#8217;s plan, even to the point of death on a cross.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as Moses was faithful</b><p>- The comparison is not a critique of Moses but an affirmation: <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a> tells us, &#8220;My servant Moses&#8230; is faithful in all My house.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a> testifies, &#8220;Moses did everything just as the LORD had commanded him.&#8221; His record of obedience in leading Israel, receiving the Law, and constructing the tabernacle was exemplary.<p>- By linking Jesus to Moses, the author bridges old-covenant history and new-covenant fulfillment, honoring Moses while preparing to show Christ&#8217;s surpassing glory (<a href="/hebrews/3-3.htm">Hebrews 3:3-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in all God&#8217;s house</b><p>- &#8220;House&#8221; points to God&#8217;s covenant community.

"It is the Lord that made Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt." As there Samuel speaks of the raising up of Moses and Aaron, constituted by God deliverers of the people; so here our thought must rest on Him who constituted Jesus "Apostle and High Priest."<p><span class= "bld">As also Moses.</span>--These words, which give the key to the following verses, are quoted from <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a>, where Moses is placed in contrast with prophets in Israel to whom the Lord will make Himself known by vision or dream. "My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house. With him will I speak mouth to mouth." The "house" or household is God's. people Israel. To others will God reveal Himself in various ways in regard to the many parts of the house, the many concerns of the household. Throughout the whole house Moses was the recipient of the divine commands, and was faithful--"faithful" (as one of the Targums paraphrases), "as chief of the chiefs of my court."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who was faithful</span> (or, <span class="accented">as being faithful</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to him that appointed</span> (literally, <span class="accented">made</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>him, as also Moses was in all his house</span>. The reference is to what was said of Moses (<a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>), "My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house," and serves aptly to introduce the intended comparison of Christ with him. In respect of faithfulness to him who constituted him in his office, Christ resembles Moses; in respect to his office itself, it is to be shown that he is far above him. Observe <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that "his house" means <span class="accented">God's</span> house, as' is plain from the text cited, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the house of him who appointed him; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that "in all his house" has reference to Moses only, not to Christ; for the main point of what follows is that Christ is <span class="accented">over</span> God's house, not in it, as Moses was. As to the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (translated in A.V. "appointed "), it may have been suggested by <a href="/1_samuel/12-6.htm">1 Samuel 12:6</a>, where the LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, the Hebrew verb being <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d4;</span>, which seems to mean in this case "constitute," not "create" (so Gesenius). The preceding words, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span>, though it is not necessary to supply them as understood, may be taken here to rule the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (cf. for a similar use of the verb without a second accusative following, <a href="/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. Thus the Arian inference from the word, that Christ is represented as a creature, is groundless. Nor need reference be supposed to his human birth or conception, the <span class="accented">temporalis generatio</span> of the man Jesus (Athanasius, Ambrose, and other Fathers).
