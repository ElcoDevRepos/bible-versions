After being delivered from slavery, they wandered in the wilderness for forty years due to their disobedience and lack of faith in God's promises (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>). This period of wandering is a significant event in Israel's history, illustrating God's patience and justice. The number forty often symbolizes a period of testing or judgment in the Bible, as seen in the forty days of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>).<p><b>Was it not with those who sinned,</b><br>The sin referred to here is primarily unbelief and rebellion against God. Despite witnessing numerous miracles, including the parting of the Red Sea and the provision of manna, the Israelites repeatedly doubted God's ability to lead them into the Promised Land (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>, <a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>). This unbelief is highlighted in <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a> as a warning to believers to guard against a similar heart of unbelief.<p><b>whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</b><br>This phrase underscores the consequence of the Israelites' sin: death in the wilderness. Out of the original generation that left Egypt, only Joshua and Caleb entered the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/14-30.htm">Numbers 14:30</a>). This serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of disobedience and unbelief. The wilderness represents a place of testing and judgment, and the fallen bodies symbolize the ultimate penalty for sin. This event is a type of spiritual warning for believers to remain faithful and obedient to God, as emphasized in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5-11</a>, which draws a parallel between the Israelites' experience and the Christian journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being who expressed anger towards the Israelites due to their disobedience and lack of faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt but wandered in the wilderness for forty years due to their rebellion and unbelief.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area where the Israelites wandered for forty years as a consequence of their disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who guided them out of Egypt and through the wilderness, though he himself was not allowed to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which was promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but was not entered by the disobedient generation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' failure to trust and obey God resulted in severe consequences, including missing out on the blessings of the Promised Land.
