The author of Hebrews frequently uses Old Testament references to connect the teachings of the New Covenant with the history and experiences of Israel. This establishes continuity and authority, reminding readers of the divine inspiration and timeless relevance of Scripture.<p><b>&#8220;Today, if you hear His voice:</b><br>The word "Today" emphasizes the immediacy and urgency of responding to God's call. It suggests that the opportunity to respond to God is always present and should not be postponed. The concept of hearing God's voice implies an active listening and obedience to His will. This echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, where Israel is called to hear and obey the Lord. It also connects to Jesus' teachings in the Gospels, where He often says, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear" (e.g., <a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>).<p><b>do not harden your hearts,</b><br>Hardening of the heart is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with resistance to God's will and a refusal to trust Him. In the context of Hebrews, it serves as a warning against unbelief and disobedience. The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions. A hardened heart is closed off to God's influence and guidance, as seen in Pharaoh's resistance in Exodus.<p><b>as you did in the rebellion.&#8221;</b><br>This refers to the Israelites' rebellion in the wilderness, particularly at Meribah and Massah, as recounted in <a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a> and <a href="/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>. The rebellion was characterized by doubt, complaint, and a lack of faith in God's provision and promises. This historical event serves as a cautionary tale for the readers of Hebrews, illustrating the consequences of unbelief and disobedience. It underscores the importance of faithfulness and trust in God's promises, drawing a parallel to the Christian journey and the need to persevere in faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The original recipients of the warning, who hardened their hearts during their wilderness journey after the Exodus from Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites during the Exodus, who witnessed their rebellion and interceded on their behalf.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting of the Israelites' rebellion, where they wandered for 40 years due to their unbelief and disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rebellion.htm">The Rebellion (Meribah)</a></b><br>Refers to specific events where the Israelites tested God, such as at Meribah, where they quarreled and doubted God's provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul or another early Christian leader, who uses this historical example to warn and encourage believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_today.htm">The Urgency of Today</a></b><br>The word "Today" emphasizes the immediacy of responding to God's voice.

What God declared centuries earlier still speaks &#8220;living and active&#8221; today (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p>- <a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a> reminds us, &#8220;Behold, now is the favorable time,&#8221; reinforcing that God&#8217;s word is timeless in its relevance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Today</b><p>- &#8220;Today&#8221; stresses urgency. God&#8217;s offer of grace is immediate; procrastination is spiritually dangerous. <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a> says, &#8220;Choose for yourselves today whom you will serve,&#8221; and <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a> urges, &#8220;Seek the LORD while He may be found.&#8221;<p>- Every sunrise renews this divine invitation, yet we are not promised an unlimited number of tomorrows (<a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>).<p>- The Spirit&#8217;s voice never schedules repentance for later; He calls for it now.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if you hear His voice</b><p>- Hearing involves more than auditory reception; it is the attentive, faith-filled response described in <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>: &#8220;Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.&#8221;<p>- Jesus said, &#8220;My sheep hear My voice; I know them, and they follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>). Genuine discipleship is shown in responsive obedience, not mere awareness.<p>- <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a> portrays the risen Lord knocking and speaking; hearts must open, not ignore.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>do not harden your hearts</b><p>- Hardening is a deliberate, repeated refusal to believe and obey.

Despite witnessing miracles, the people grumbled, doubted, and refused to enter the Promised Land. <a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22-23</a> records God&#8217;s verdict: that generation would not see the land because of unbelief.<p>- <a href="/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40-41</a> laments, &#8220;How often they rebelled in the wilderness and grieved Him in the desert!&#8221; Their story stands as a cautionary tale.<p>- Paul echoes the warning for the church: &#8220;These things happened as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they did&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6-12</a>).

By many it is held that the words should be joined with what follows, and commence a new paragraph; but this does not seem probable. Either <a href="/hebrews/3-14.htm" title="For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;">Hebrews 3:14</a> is parenthetical, so that this verse emphasises the reference to "today" in <a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm" title="But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.">Hebrews 3:13</a>; or the thought of the writer is that we must "hold fast the beginning of our confidence" <span class= "ital">in the presence of</span> this divine warning--whilst day by day these words are addressed to us anew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While it is said, Today</span>, etc. Commentators have found unnecessary difficulty in determining the connection of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Many, taking the words as the beginning of a new sentence, have been at pains to discover the apodosis to them. Cbrysostom, Grotius, Rosenmuller, and others find it in <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="/hebrews/4-1.htm">Hebrews 4:1</a>; notwithstanding the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, which seems evidently to introduce a new sentence, and the long parenthesis which, on this supposition, intervenes. Others find it in <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("harden not your hearts"), in the middle of the citation of ver. 16, as if the writer of the Epistle adopted these words as his own. Delitzsch finds it in ver. 16, taken as an interrogation (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span>: see below); thus: "When it is said, Today... harden not your hearts as in the provocation,... who did provoke? Nay, did not all?" The <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> he accounts for by its idiomatic use found in such passages as <a href="/acts/8-31.htm">Acts 8:31</a>; <a href="/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a>, conveying the sense of the English, "<span class="accented">Why</span>, who did provoke?" But this use of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, obvious in the texts adduced as parallel, would be forced here; the structure of the sentence does not easily lend itself to it. Still, this is the view taken by Tholuck, Bleek, De Wette, Lunemann, and others, as well as Delitzsch. But, notwithstanding such weighty support, difficulties are surely best avoided by taking <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, not as commencing a new sentence, but in connection with ver. 14 preceding, as it seems most natural to take it in the absence of any connecting particle to mark a new proposition. In this case the translation of the A.V. gives a fully satisfactory sense: "If we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end, while it is still being said, To-day," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> (as in ver. 13) "so long as it is called Today." Ebrard, Alford, and others, taking the same view of the connection of the words, prefer the translation, "In that it is said." But the other seems more in accordance with the thought pervading the passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
