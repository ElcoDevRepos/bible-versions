His story begins in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>, where God calls him to leave his homeland and promises to make him a great nation. Abraham's journey is foundational for understanding God's covenant with His people. He is revered in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, highlighting his significant role in biblical history.<p><b>after waiting patiently</b><br>Abraham's patience is exemplified in his long wait for the fulfillment of God's promise of a son. Despite his advanced age and Sarah's barrenness, Abraham believed God's promise. This period of waiting is a testament to his faith and trust in God's timing, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, where Abraham's faith is credited to him as righteousness.<p><b>obtained the promise</b><br>The promise refers to the birth of Isaac, the son through whom God's covenant would continue. This fulfillment is recorded in <a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-3</a>. Isaac's birth is a pivotal moment, demonstrating God's faithfulness and the realization of His promises. It also prefigures the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, as seen in the New Testament, where Jesus is the promised seed of Abraham (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>A central figure in the Bible, known as the father of faith.

The writer is drawing a conclusion: because God has staked His own unchanging nature on the promise, the outcome for Abraham was certain. Much like <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>, &#8220;God is not a man, that He should lie,&#8221; the text reminds us that every divine pledge rests on God&#8217;s flawless character.
