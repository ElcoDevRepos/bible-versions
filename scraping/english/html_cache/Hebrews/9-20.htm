In the context of <a href="/hebrews/9.htm">Hebrews 9</a>, the author is recalling the words of Moses during the establishment of the Old Covenant. This sets the stage for understanding the importance of the covenant and its implications for the audience.<p><b>&#8220;This is the blood of the covenant,</b><br>The phrase "blood of the covenant" is a direct reference to <a href="/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>, where Moses sprinkles the blood of sacrificed animals on the people, signifying the ratification of the covenant between God and Israel. Blood, in biblical terms, symbolizes life and is essential for atonement (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). This foreshadows the New Covenant established through the blood of Jesus Christ, as seen in the Last Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>), where Jesus refers to His blood as the "blood of the covenant."<p><b>which God has commanded you to keep.&#8221;</b><br>This part emphasizes the divine origin and authority of the covenant. The covenant is not a human invention but a command from God, requiring obedience and faithfulness from the people. In the historical context, the Israelites were bound to follow the laws and stipulations given by God through Moses. This reflects the seriousness of the covenant relationship and the expectation of adherence to God's commands. In the New Testament, this is paralleled by the call to follow Christ and His teachings, as the New Covenant is also established by God's command and requires commitment from believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who mediated the Old Covenant between God and His people.
