The author of Hebrews is emphasizing the role and nature of angels in contrast to the Son, Jesus Christ. Angels are created beings, serving as messengers and ministers of God. In the biblical context, angels are often seen as powerful and awe-inspiring, yet they are subordinate to Christ. This sets the stage for the argument that follows in Hebrews, which elevates the status of Jesus above all heavenly beings.<p><b>&#8220;He makes His angels winds,</b><br>The imagery of angels as "winds" suggests their swiftness and invisibility, characteristics often associated with spiritual beings. In the ancient Near Eastern context, winds were seen as powerful forces of nature, underlining the might and dynamic presence of angels. This metaphor also implies that angels are under God's command, moving according to His will, much like the wind is directed by natural forces. The use of "winds" can also be seen as a reference to the Holy Spirit, who is often symbolized by wind in Scripture, indicating the spiritual nature of angelic beings.<p><b>His servants flames of fire.&#8221;</b><br>The depiction of angels as "flames of fire" highlights their purity, holiness, and the consuming nature of their service. Fire in the Bible often represents God's presence, judgment, and purification. This imagery connects to the role of angels as executors of God's will, sometimes bringing judgment or protection. The cultural context of fire as a purifying and powerful element reinforces the idea of angels as agents of God's holy purposes. This phrase also draws a parallel to the divine nature of Christ, who is described in Revelation as having eyes like a flame of fire, further emphasizing the superiority of Jesus over the angels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Spiritual beings created by God to serve as His messengers and servants.

This sets up the chapter&#8217;s major theme: Christ&#8217;s superiority over every created being.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He makes His angels winds</b><p>&#8226; The quotation comes from <a href="/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>: &#8220;He makes the winds His messengers, flames of fire His servants.&#8221; Hebrews reverses the wording to stress that the angels themselves are fashioned to carry out God&#8217;s will.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Winds&#8221; conveys swiftness, invisibility, and global reach. Angels obey instantly and move at God&#8217;s command, just as the wind changes direction at His word (<a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Their mobility shows God&#8217;s sovereignty: He dispatches them wherever He pleases, whether to protect the faithful (<a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11&#8211;12</a>) or to execute judgment (<a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; We see this windy ministry in <a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26, 39</a> where an angel directs Philip&#8217;s steps and the Spirit snatches him away, illustrating how God&#8217;s messengers operate beyond human limitation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His servants flames of fire</b><p>&#8226; Fire in Scripture pictures purity, power, and the presence of God. Angels, as &#8220;flames of fire,&#8221; reflect His holiness and carry out consuming judgment when required (<a href="/genesis/19-13.htm">Genesis 19:13, 24</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-5.htm">Revelation 8:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Flames also illuminate and guide. An angel appeared as fire in the burning bush to commission Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>), and a pillar of fire guarded Israel at night (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19&#8211;20</a>), indicating God&#8217;s protective banner through angelic ministry.<p>&#8226; This fiery imagery underscores that angels are not only swift but also potent&#8212;capable of delivering decisive action, whether rescuing Peter from prison (<a href="/acts/12-7.htm">Acts 12:7</a>) or striking down Herod (<a href="/acts/12-23.htm">Acts 12:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Their flaming nature contrasts with the Son, who is Himself &#8220;the radiance of God&#8217;s glory&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>); angels merely reflect the fire that Christ intrinsically is.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a> teaches that angels are created, commanded, and commissioned by God. He fashions them like winds&#8212;swift, unseen, far-reaching&#8212;and like flames of fire&#8212;pure, powerful, radiant. They serve at His pleasure, executing protection or judgment while reflecting traits of His own majesty. By exalting Christ immediately afterward, the passage reminds us that while angels are impressive servants, Jesus alone is the sovereign, eternal Son.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Spirits.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">winds.</span> It is very difficult to assign any clear meaning to the ordinary rendering,--unless, indeed, we were to adopt the very strange opinion of many of the earlier commentators, that the stress is laid on "maketh" in the sense of "createth." The parallelism in these two lines of Hebrew poetry is complete, "angels" answering to "ministers," "winds" to "a flame of fire." The meaning appears to be that God, employing His messengers for His varied purposes, sends them forth in what manner He may please, clothing them with the appearance of the resistless wind or the devouring fire. (We may contrast <a href="/context/1_kings/19-11.htm" title="And he said, Go forth, and stand on the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:">1Kings 19:11-12</a>.) The force of the passage lies in the vividness with which it presents the thought of the Most High served by angels who "at His bidding speed," untiring as the wind, subtle as the fire. We feel much more distinctly than we can put into words the infinite contrast between such ministers and the Son seated at the right hand of God. The quotation is taken from <a href="/psalms/104-4.htm" title="Who makes his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:">Psalm 104:4</a>, without any variation in the Greek. Whether this translation faithfully represents the original is a question that has been warmly discussed. Not that there is any doubt that such a rendering of the Hebrew is in itself natural; but it is often alleged that the context requires an inversion of the words, <span class= "ital">Who maketh winds His messengers, flaming fire His ministers.</span> The point cannot be examined here; we will only express a decided opinion that the translation defended above not only expresses the meaning of the Hebrew, but perfectly accords with the context of the Psalm.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire</span>. A further intimation of the position assigned in the Old Testament to angels, contrasted by means of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, with further quotations with reference to the SON. A difficulty has been felt with regard to this passage (cited, as usual, from the LXX.) on the ground of the original Hebrew being supposed not to bear the meaning assigned to it. Hence the writer of the Epistle is said to have made use of an erroneous rendering for the purpose of his argument. Certainly the <span class="accented">context</span> of the psalm, in which God is represented as arraying himself in the glories and operating through the powers of nature, suggests no other meaning than that he uses the winds as his messengers, etc., in the same poetical sense in which he was said in the preceding verse to make the clouds his chariot; cf. <a href="/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>, "<span class="accented">Fire</span> and hail, snow and vapors, stormy <span class="accented">wind</span> fulfilling his word." If so, there is no necessary reference in the original psalm to angels. But it is to be observed, on the other hand, that the structure of ver. 4 is not in the Hebrew identical with that of "he maketh the clouds his chariot" in ver. 3, and hence, in itself, suggests some difference of meaning. For <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a different <span class="accented">verb</span> is used; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the <span class="accented">order</span> of the accusatives following the verb is reversed; in both which respects the I,XX. correctly follows the Hebrew. In ver. 3 the verb is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> in the LXX.), the primary meaning of which is "to set," "to place," and, when followed by two accusatives as object and predicate, denotes" to constitute or render a person or thing what the predicate expresses." In ver. 4 the verb is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in the LXX.), the primary meaning of which, when used actively, is "to form," "to fabricate." It is used of God making the heaven and the earth (<a href="/genesis/1-7.htm">Genesis 1:7, 16</a>; <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>, etc.). When elsewhere, as here, it is followed by two accusatives, one of them (which may come either first or second in order) is found to denote the material out of which anything is formed. Thus <a href="/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>, "He made all the vessels (<span class="accented">of</span>) brass" (cf. <a href="/exodus/30-25.htm">Exodus 30:25</a>; <a href="/exodus/36-14.htm">Exodus 36:14</a>; <a href="/exodus/37-15.htm">Exodus 37:15, 23</a>). Hence an obvious meaning of ver. 4, so far as the mere language is concerned, would be, "He maketh [or, 'formeth'] his messengers [or, 'angels'] of winds, and his ministers <span class="accented">of a</span> flaming fire." (<span class="accented">Winds</span> certainly, not <span class="accented">spirits</span>, because of the context. But here the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> is, in itself, as ambiguous as the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> and was as probably meant to denote <span class="accented">winds.</span>) According to this rendering, the meaning of the verse would seem to be that, out of the natural elements of wind and fire, some special agencies are called into being or operation; not simply that winds and fire generally are used for God's purposes. The change of phraseology between vers. 3 and 4 certainly suggests some change in the idea of the psalmist. What, then, are these agencies? What is meant by the "messengers" and "ministers" connected with the elements of wind and fire? The author of the Epistle (and probably the LXX. too, though the words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> are, in themselves, as ambiguous as the Hebrew) saw in these words a reference to the angels, who are denoted by the same two words in <a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20, 21</a>, and who are undoubtedly spoken of elsewhere in the Old Testament as operating in the forces of nature (as in the death of the Egyptian firstborn, the pestilence in the time of David, and the destruction of Sennacherib's army), and seem, in some sense, to be identified with the winds themselves in <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>, "He rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind;" and in <a href="/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a>, "Let them be as chaff before the wind; and let the angel of the LORD chase them." We say that the LXX., as well as the author of the Epistle, probably intended to express this meaning. It is, indeed, more than probable; for, ambiguous as may be the words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ffd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;</span>, the structure of the Greek sentence (in which "his angels" and "his ministers" are the objects, arid "winds" and "flames of fire" the predicates), seems to necessitate this meaning, which is further probable from what we know of Alexandrian angelology. It may thus well be that, whether or net the LXX. (rendering, as it does, the Hebrew word for word) gives the exact force of the original phrase, it hits its essential meaning, as intimating angelic agency in nature. And the learned Jews of Alexandria, followed as they are by the later rabbis generally, and by the writer of this Epistle, were, to say the least, as likely to understand the Hebrew as any modern scholars. The question, however, is not, after all, of great importance. For let us grant that the writer of the Epistle unwittingly adduced an erroneous rendering in the course of his argument. What then? It is not necessary to suppose that the inspiration of the sacred writers was such as to enlighten them in matters of Hebrew criticism. If it guarded them from erroneous teaching, it was sufficient for its purpose. And in this case the passage, as cited, at any rate expresses well the general doctrine of the Old Testament about angels, viz. that, unlike the Son, they are but subordinate agents of the Divine purposes, and connected especially with the operations of nature. It is to be observed, too, that the quotations generally in this Epistle are adduced, not as exhaustive proofs, but rather as suggestive of the general teaching of the Old Testament, with which the readers are supposed to be familiar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/1-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">about</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
