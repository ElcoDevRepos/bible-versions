The food laws distinguished clean and unclean animals (Leviticus 11), while the special washings involved various purification rituals (<a href="/numbers/19-7.htm">Numbers 19:7-10</a>). These regulations were symbolic, pointing to the need for spiritual purity and separation from sin.

They were imposed as part of the Old Covenant, which was a preparatory system leading to the New Covenant established by Jesus Christ. The "time of reform" refers to the coming of Christ, who fulfilled the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>) and inaugurated a new era of grace and truth (<a href="/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>).

These washings highlighted humanity&#8217;s need for purity and foreshadowed the once-for-all washing accomplished at the cross (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>External regulations</b><p>Food laws and washings were outward acts.

But there are other readings, though none, any more than that of the Textus Receptus, to be decidedly preferred on the mere ground of manuscript authority. The best sense seems to be given by that of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3a9;&#x1ffd;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, so that we may render (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> being taken in the sense of <span class="accented">addition</span>), Being only (<span class="cmt_word">with meats and drinks and divers washings</span>) <span class="cmt_word">carnal ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation.</span> We thus have an obvious neuter plural (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> to agree with, and we avoid the assertion that the "gifts and sacrifices" of the Law "stood only" in "meats," etc. This was not so; their essential part was blood-shedding (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> ver. 22) the other things here mentioned were but accompaniments and appendages. The "meats and drinks" spoken of may refer mainly to the distinctions between clean and unclean viands, which we know were made such a point of by the Jews of the apostolic ago (cf. <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-23</a>; <a href="/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>; also <a href="/mark/7-15.htm">Mark 7:15</a>). The "diverse washings" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) may be taken to include both the ablutions of the priests before sacrifice, and those enjoined on the people in many parts of the Law after ceremonial defile-merit, which kind of washings had been further multiplied variously in the traditional law (cf. <a href="/mark/7-3.htm">Mark 7:3, 4, 8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/9-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[ They consist ] only</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(monon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3440.htm">Strong's 3440: </a> </span><span class="str2">Alone, but, only.
