It serves as a transition, urging the audience to heed the lessons from Israel's history.<p><b>while the promise of entering His rest still stands</b><br>The "rest" refers to the spiritual rest offered by God, symbolized by the Promised Land in the Old Testament. This promise remains available, indicating that God's offer of salvation and eternal rest is still open. The concept of rest is rooted in the Sabbath rest of <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a> and is fulfilled in Christ, who offers rest for the soul (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>let us be careful</b><br>This phrase is a call to vigilance and self-examination. The original Greek implies a sense of fear or reverence, suggesting that believers should take seriously the possibility of missing out on God's rest. It echoes the exhortation in <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a> to "work out your salvation with fear and trembling."<p><b>that none of you be deemed to have fallen short of it</b><br>The warning is communal, addressing the entire faith community. The phrase "fallen short" suggests failing to reach a goal, similar to the Israelites who fell short of entering Canaan due to unbelief (<a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22-23</a>).

It is noteworthy that the writer begins with "Let us," though about to write "lest any of <span class= "ital">you;"</span> he will have gained his object if he brings his readers to share his fear.<p><span class= "bld">Lest, a promise being left us.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">lest haply, a promise being</span> (still) <span class= "ital">left.</span> No word must be inserted here that can diminish the generality of the words; in the sequel the statement will be repeated with all possible clearness. Here it is simply said that such a promise remains unexhausted, waiting for complete fulfilment. No Hebrew Christian would doubt this. As in Hebrews 1, the writer's aim is not to establish a truth absolutely new, but to show that in this and in that Scripture a received truth lies contained. Most of our earlier versions (following Luther and Erasmus) give to this clause a different turn, which cannot be correct: "Lest any of you by forsaking the promise of entering in His rest."<p><span class= "bld">Any of you should seem to come short of it.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">any one of you should be accounted to have come short of it.</span> The difficulty here lies in the words rendered "seem" or "be accounted." It appears impossible that the meaning can be "should <span class= "ital">even</span> seem," or "should think himself," or "should show himself," to have failed. It may be that the writer avoids positive and direct language in speaking of what lies beyond mortal ken, and therefore reverently says "should seem to have come short of it." It is more probable that he is influenced by the figure contained in the next word, the <span class= "ital">falling short of</span> a mark; and is thus led to refer to the judge who witnesses and declares the failure,--"Lest any one . . . be held (or, <span class= "ital">be adjudged</span>) to have come short of" the promise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us fear, therefore, lest, a promise being still left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short</span>. This verse is a renewed warning against remissness, based (as is shown by the connecting <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>) on the preceding argument, but introducing also, by means of the clause, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., a new thought, the elucidation of which is the subject of what follows. The new thought is that the true "rest of God," typified only by the rest of Canaan, remains still for the attainment of Christians. That this is the case has not yet been shown; and hence the clause, "a promise being still left." etc., does not point to a conclusion already arrived at, but to what is coming. The new thought is taken up in ver. 2, and what has been thus intimated in ver. 1 is asserted as a conclusion after proof in ver. 9. <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, etc. A different view of the drift of the warning in this verse, main-rained very decidedly by Ebrard, demands attention. It rests on the interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which is taken to mean "should think that he has come too late," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the promise of the rest, under the idea that its meaning had been exhausted in the rest of Canaan. It may be said in support of this view that such is the most obvious meaning of the phrase; that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in the New Testament most commonly means "think" or "suppose;" that the primary sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is that of being behindhand, either in place or in time; and that the perfect <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is thus accounted for, whereas, according to the usual interpretation, the whole phrase is unsuitable: why was not <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span> written, if a mere warning against remissness was intended? Further, it may be said that what immediately follows is in favor of this view of the purport of the caution in ver. 1, being an evident carrying out of its idea. Thus the verse is supposed to be not at all a continuation of the previous hortatory section, but rather serving as the thesis of the coming argumentative section, though put in the form of a caution because imperfect appreciation of the view to be now established was at the root of the danger of the Hebrew Christians. Some of them at least did not fully grasp the true character of the gospel as being the fulfill-merit of the old dispensation, the realization of its types and promises. They were inclined to rest in the Law as a revelation to which the gospel was only supplementary, and hence to regard the promised land, the offer of which was before their time, as the only rest intended; and therefore the writer, after adducing the example of the Israelites under Moses as a warning against remissness, prefaces his exposition. of the true rest of God by a warning against misapprehending it. But against this view of the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> there are the following reasons: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> suggests rather (like <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) a warning against conduct that might lead to forfeiture than a correction of an inadequate conception; and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> connects the warning with what has gone before, in which the view of what the true rest is has not entered. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Though <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is most frequently used in the New Testament in its sense of "thinking," "<span class="accented">seeming</span> to one's self," yet it has there, as in Greek generally, the sense also of "appearing," "seeming to others;" and certainly, as far as the word itself is concerned, may have this sense here. <span class="accented">Also</span> the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, though its primary idea (as of <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is that of "coming after," is nevertheless invariably used in the New Testament to express "deficiency," or "falling short" (cf. especially in this Epistle, <a href="/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>): it is never elsewhere (though capable of the meaning) used to express lateness in time. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in the sense of "<span class="accented">seem</span> to have fallen short" (rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>) is capable of being accounted for. One explanation of it, adopted by Alford, is indeed hardly tenable. He accounts for the past tense by supposing reference to the final judgment; taking it to mean, "<span class="accented">lest</span> any one of you should then appear [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> be found] to have fallen short." But the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, which, however used, refers, not to what is made evident, but to what is thought or seems, refuses to be thus misinterpreted. It is better to take it as a softening expression. We may suppose that the writer (with a delicacy that reminds us of St. Paul) was unwilling to imply his own expectation of any failure; and so he only bids his readers beware of so living as even to present the appearance of it or suggest the thought of it to others. According to this view, the tense of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is intelligible, the supposed deficiency spoken of being previous to its being perceived or suspected. It is not <span class="accented">necessary</span> to supply an understood genitive, such as "the promise," or "the rest," after <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It <span class="accented">may</span> be used (as elsewhere) absolutely, to express deficiency or failure; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the conditions required for attainment. One view of its meaning is that it has reference to the idea of being behindhand in a race: but there is nothing in the context to suggest this figure.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/4-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
