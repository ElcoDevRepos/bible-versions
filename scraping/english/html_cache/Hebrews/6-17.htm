The "unchanging nature" reflects God's immutability, a key attribute of God, indicating that His purposes and promises do not change over time. This is consistent with passages like <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>, "For I the Lord do not change," and <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>, which speaks of God as having "no variation or shadow due to change." The context of Hebrews is addressing Jewish Christians who are familiar with the Old Testament, where God's faithfulness and unchanging nature are repeatedly affirmed.<p><b>to the heirs of the promise</b><br>The "heirs of the promise" refers to those who are recipients of God's covenant promises, initially given to Abraham and his descendants. In the New Testament context, this extends to all believers in Christ, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>, "If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham&#8217;s seed, and heirs according to the promise." This highlights the continuity of God's plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament, where the promises made to Abraham are fulfilled in Christ and extended to all who have faith in Him.<p><b>He guaranteed it with an oath</b><br>God's use of an oath underscores the seriousness and certainty of His promise. In ancient times, oaths were a common way to confirm a promise or agreement, often invoking a higher power as a witness. God's oath is unique because He swears by Himself, as there is no higher authority (<a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>). This reflects the cultural and historical practice of oath-taking while emphasizing God's ultimate authority and reliability. The reference to God's oath also connects to the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16-18</a>, where God swears by Himself to bless Abraham and his descendants, reinforcing the idea of God's unbreakable commitment to His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, emphasizing His unchanging nature and His commitment to His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heirs_of_the_promise.htm">Heirs of the Promise</a></b><br>Refers to believers who are recipients of God's promises, particularly those made to Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/oath.htm">Oath</a></b><br>A solemn promise made by God to assure the heirs of the certainty and unchangeability of His purpose.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_god's_promises.htm">The Certainty of God's Promises</a></b><br>God's promises are guaranteed by His unchanging nature and His oath.

We cannot doubt, as we read this whole passage, that there is a special reason for the emphasis thus laid on God's <span class= "ital">oath</span> to Abraham. The writer dwells on this confirmation of the divine word of promise, not merely because it is the first recorded in sacred history, but because he has in thought the declaration of <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>. To this as yet he makes no reference; though he has quoted from the verse repeatedly, it has been without mention of the divine oath: but throughout the section before us he is preparing the way for his later argument in <a href="/hebrews/7-21.htm" title="(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said to him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)">Hebrews 7:21</a>. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/6-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8103;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Dative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#949;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Theos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2316.htm">Strong's 2316: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deity, especially the supreme Divinity; figuratively, a magistrate; by Hebraism, very.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wanted</span><br /><span class="grk">&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(boulomenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1014.htm">Strong's 1014: </a> </span><span class="str2">To will, intend, desire, wish.
