In biblical times, the construction of a house was a significant endeavor, often involving skilled labor and careful planning. This reflects the broader biblical theme that creation itself is not random but is the result of intentional design. The idea of a house being built by someone can be connected to the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/24-3.htm">Proverbs 24:3-4</a>, which speaks of building a house with wisdom and understanding. It also echoes the parable of the wise and foolish builders in <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>, where the foundation of a house is crucial, symbolizing the importance of a strong spiritual foundation.<p><b>but God is the builder of everything</b><br>This phrase asserts God's sovereignty and creative power over all things. It aligns with the biblical narrative of God as the ultimate Creator, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God creates the heavens and the earth. Theologically, this underscores the belief in God's omnipotence and His role as the sustainer of the universe. In the New Testament, this is further supported by passages like <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>, which affirm that all things were created through and for Christ, and He holds all things together. This phrase also serves as a reminder of God's providence and His active involvement in the world, contrasting human builders with the divine Builder who orchestrates all of creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate Creator and Builder of all things, emphasizing His sovereignty and divine authority over creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>Symbolically represents the church or the community of believers, as well as the physical universe, all of which are under God's creative power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_builder.htm">The Builder</a></b><br>Refers to human builders in a literal sense, but ultimately points to God as the supreme architect of all existence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate source and sustainer of all creation.

Moses served as an honored steward, yet still only a servant within the structure.<p>&#8226; This lays the groundwork for the argument that while human leaders contribute meaningfully, their work remains derivative and dependent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But God</b><p>&#8226; The little word &#8220;but&#8221; creates a decisive contrast: human builders versus the divine Builder.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently elevates God above every human craftsman&#8212;&#8220;The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/17-24.htm">Acts 17:24</a> echoes the same distinction: &#8220;The God who made the world and all things in it&#8230; does not dwell in temples made by human hands.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is the builder of everything</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/3-4.htm">Hebrews 3:4</a> concludes, &#8220;God is the builder of everything.&#8221; The scope stretches from galaxies to the human heart (<a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a> affirms, &#8220;Through Him all things were made, and without Him nothing was made that has been made.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The point: If every physical house requires a maker, how much more the universe.

While people like Moses play honored, faithful roles within God&#8217;s household, only the Lord deserves ultimate glory. Recognizing Him as the Builder of everything strengthens our faith, humbles our pride, and anchors our hope in the One whose workmanship spans both time and eternity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">For every house is builded by some man.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">by some one</span>: the thought of the house leads at once to the thought of the builder of it. The meaning of the several parts of this verse is very simple; but it is not easy to follow the reasoning with certainty. The second clause seems to be a condensed expression of this thought: "But He that built this house is He that built all things, God." "Moses is possessed of lesser glory than the Apostle of our confession, as the house stands below its maker in honour. For this house, like every other, has its maker:--it is He who made all things, even God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For every house is builded</span> (or, <span class="accented">established</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>by some one; but he that built</span> (or, <span class="accented">established</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>all things is God</span>. Of the second clause of this verse "God" is rightly taken by modern commentators as the subject, not the predicate, though the Fathers generally take it otherwise. Thus Theodoret, regarding as a <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> designation of Christ, views this clause as an assertion of his Deity on the ground of his being the Founder of all things. But this view introduces an idea out of keeping with the argument, and especially with the preceding expression, "faithful to him who appointed him," in which Christ, in his office as the Christ, is distinguished from the Creator of all who appointed him to that office. The verse seems to be interposed in elucidation of the preceding <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, to make it clear that the Founder of the house spoken of is God himself, and thus to give full effect to the proportionate glory of Christ in comparison with that of Moses. Thus: the glory of Christ is greater than that of Moses by so much as the honor of the founder of a house is greater than that of the house; - of the founder, we say; for every house has some founder: but God is the original Founder of all things, and therefore of necessity the Founder of this house of his own in which Moses was a servant. The verse, thus interpreted, seems (as intimated there) to fall in with the train of thought mere naturally than it can be shown to do if Christ is 'regarded as the Builder. <span class="accented">Possibly</span> "all things" may be purposely used to denote the house itself over which Christ, as Son, is Lord. For, though the expression seems too wide for the limited house in which Moses was a servant, it is net so for the expanded and consummated house over which Christ in glory reigns; cf. <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, "Whom he appointed Heir of <span class="accented">all things</span>;" and <a href="/hebrews/2-8.htm">Hebrews 2:8</a>, "Thou hast put <span class="accented">all things in</span> subjection under his feet;" the last being said in especial connection with the "glory and honor" wherewith Christ "has been counted worthy" to be crowned. It is not necessary to confine the meaning of "God's house" to the Mosaic dispensation, or to assign to it (as some have done) two separate meanings in the cases of Moses and of Christ. It may be regarded as a comprehensive term, including in its general meaning the Law, the gospel, and the final consummation the whole dispensation of redemption, beginning with the Law, and completed at the second advent. Moses held office in its early stage, and there only as a servant; in its ultimate <span class="accented">development</span> it comprises "all things," and over "all things," thus comprised, Christ, as SON, has been shown to be by inheritance absolute Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/3-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
