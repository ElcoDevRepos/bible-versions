Despite being promised the land, they understood that their ultimate inheritance was not earthly but spiritual. This longing for a "better country" signifies a desire for the eternal kingdom of God, which is consistent with the teachings of Jesus about the Kingdom of Heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>). The concept of a "heavenly one" aligns with the New Testament's emphasis on eternal life and the new creation (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>). The patriarchs' faith is a model for believers, encouraging them to focus on eternal promises rather than temporary, worldly gains.<p><b>Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God,</b><br>This statement underscores the deep relationship between God and those who live by faith. In the Old Testament, God often identified Himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>), signifying a covenant relationship. The phrase indicates God's approval and pride in those who trust in Him, as seen in His promises and faithfulness. It also reflects the honor God bestows upon those who seek Him earnestly, as He is pleased with their faith (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>). This relationship is further exemplified in the New Testament, where believers are called children of God (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>).<p><b>for He has prepared a city for them.</b><br>This part of the verse points to the eschatological hope of a future dwelling place with God. The "city" is often interpreted as the New Jerusalem, described in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>, which symbolizes the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises to His people. This city is not built by human hands but is a divine creation, representing the eternal home for believers. The preparation of this city is a testament to God's sovereignty and His plan for redemption and restoration. It echoes Jesus' promise in <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>, where He assures His disciples of preparing a place for them in His Father's house. This assurance provides comfort and hope for believers, affirming that their faith will culminate in eternal communion with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/patriarchs.htm">Patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob)</a></b><br>These are the individuals primarily referenced in <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, who lived by faith and looked forward to God's promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_country.htm">Heavenly Country</a></b><br>This represents the eternal dwelling place with God, a better and heavenly homeland that the faithful long for.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_prepared_by_god.htm">City Prepared by God</a></b><br>Symbolizes the eternal city, often understood as the New Jerusalem, prepared by God for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/longing_for_the_eternal.htm">Longing for the Eternal</a></b><br>Believers are called to set their hearts on eternal things, not just earthly possessions or achievements.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_identity.htm">Faith and Identity</a></b><br>Our identity as Christians is rooted in our relationship with God, who is not ashamed to be called our God when we live by faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_prepared_place.htm">God's Prepared Place</a></b><br>Trust in God's promise that He has prepared a place for us, which should inspire hope and perseverance in our faith journey.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_pilgrims.htm">Living as Pilgrims</a></b><br>Like the patriarchs, we are pilgrims on earth, and our ultimate home is with God.

They &#8220;acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a>). Their longing shaped daily choices: Abraham left Ur without a map (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1&#8211;4</a>); Moses forsook Egypt&#8217;s treasures (<a href="/hebrews/11-24.htm">Hebrews 11:24&#8211;26</a>). <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a> reminds us, &#8220;Our citizenship is in heaven.&#8221; Like them, we are called to travel light, valuing eternal realities over temporary comforts (<a href="/hebrews/13-14.htm">Hebrews 13:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a heavenly one</b><p>The &#8220;better country&#8221; is explicitly &#8220;a heavenly one.&#8221; Jesus points to it when He says, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many rooms&#8230; I go to prepare a place for you&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2</a>). <a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1&#8211;2</a> urges us to &#8220;set your hearts on things above.&#8221; This heavenly focus keeps hope alive through suffering, just as it did for those tortured yet refusing release &#8220;so that they might obtain a better resurrection&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-35.htm">Hebrews 11:35</a>).

Jesus cites the same verse to prove resurrection life (<a href="/matthew/22-31.htm">Matthew 22:31&#8211;32</a>). When we confess Christ publicly, He acknowledges us before the Father (<a href="/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>).

This is the general current of thought in these verses, presenting a very close analogy to the argument of <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm" title="Why (as the Holy Ghost said, To day if you will hear his voice,">Hebrews 3:7</a> to <a href="/hebrews/4-11.htm" title="Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.">Hebrews 4:11</a>; here, as there, words which otherwise might appear to have but an earthly reference are seen to have a higher and a spiritual import. In <a href="/context/hebrews/11-8.htm" title="By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing where he went.">Hebrews 11:8-9</a> we have before us only the land of inheritance, but in <a href="/hebrews/11-10.htm" title="For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.">Hebrews 11:10</a> the heavenly rest; and in <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm" title="These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.">Hebrews 11:13</a> words which as read in Genesis might seem to refer to a wandering life in the land of Canaan are taken as a confession of sojourning upon <span class= "ital">earth.</span> It is not necessary to suppose that the desires and yearnings of "the fathers" expressed themselves in the definite forms which later revelation has made familiar; in all that is essential the hope existed, whilst the mode of the fulfilment was unknown. Through faith the patriarchs were willing to connect their whole life and that of their children with waiting at God's bidding for the fulfilment of a promise--wandering and sojourning until God's own time should come when He would grant a home in a country of their own. And yet each of these servants of God recognised that relation to God in which lay the foundation of the promise to him to be personal and abiding. If these two thoughts be united, it will be easy to see how each one for himself would be led to regard the state of wandering in which he spent his life as an emblem of a state of earthly waiting for an enduring home; the sojourning in the land was a constant symbol of the sojourning upon earth. Hence (see the passages quoted in <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm" title="These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.">Hebrews 11:13</a>) the same language is used from age to age after Canaan is received as an inheritance.
