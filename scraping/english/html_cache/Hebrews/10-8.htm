The author of Hebrews often uses Old Testament scripture to demonstrate the fulfillment of prophecy and the superiority of Christ's sacrifice. The "He" in this context is understood to be Christ, emphasizing His divine authority and role as the ultimate revelation of God's will.<p><b>&#8220;Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings</b><br>These terms encompass the various types of sacrifices prescribed in the Mosaic Law, found in Leviticus and Numbers. Sacrifices and offerings were central to the Old Covenant, serving as a means for the Israelites to atone for sin and maintain a relationship with God. Burnt offerings were entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication to God, while sin offerings were specifically for atonement. This phrase highlights the comprehensive nature of the sacrificial system.<p><b>You did not desire, nor did You delight in them&#8221;</b><br>This statement underscores a key theological point: God&#8217;s ultimate desire is not in the ritualistic observance of the law but in obedience and a heart aligned with His will. This echoes the sentiments found in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>, where God expresses that obedience is better than sacrifice. It points to the insufficiency of the Old Covenant sacrifices to fully reconcile humanity to God, paving the way for the necessity of Christ's perfect sacrifice.<p><b>(although they are offered according to the law).</b><br>This parenthetical note acknowledges that the sacrifices were indeed part of the divinely instituted law given to Moses. It affirms the legitimacy and divine origin of the law while simultaneously pointing out its limitations. The law served as a tutor leading to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>), highlighting the need for a new covenant established through Jesus, who fulfills and transcends the law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, whose sacrifice is the ultimate fulfillment of the Old Testament sacrificial system.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.
