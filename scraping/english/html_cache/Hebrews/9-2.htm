It was meticulously designed according to God's instructions to Moses on Mount Sinai. The preparation of the tabernacle involved skilled craftsmanship and the use of precious materials, symbolizing the holiness and majesty of God. The tabernacle served as the dwelling place of God among His people, foreshadowing the incarnation of Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>In its first room were the lampstand, the table, and the consecrated bread.</b><br>The first room of the tabernacle, known as the Holy Place, contained specific items with deep symbolic meaning. The lampstand, or menorah, was made of pure gold and provided light, representing God's guidance and the light of His presence. The table held the consecrated bread, also known as the Bread of the Presence or showbread, which consisted of twelve loaves symbolizing the twelve tribes of Israel. This bread was a continual offering before the Lord, signifying God's provision and fellowship with His people. The items in the Holy Place prefigure Christ, who is the light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>) and the bread of life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>This was called the Holy Place.</b><br>The Holy Place was the first section of the tabernacle, distinct from the Most Holy Place, or Holy of Holies, which housed the Ark of the Covenant. The Holy Place was accessible only to the priests, who performed daily rituals and maintained the sacred items. This separation emphasized the holiness of God and the need for mediation between God and humanity. The concept of holiness is central to understanding the nature of God and His requirements for His people. The Holy Place serves as a type of the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ, our High Priest, intercedes for us (<a href="/hebrews/8.htm">Hebrews 8:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, as described in the Old Testament.

Though they were formed on the same general model, their very nature and design necessitated changes of plan and detail which unfitted them for the writer's argument here. So far as the Temple was a copy of the Tabernacle, and so far only, was it made "after the pattern" that Moses had seen; and so far only was its symbolism of divine and not human origin.<p><span class= "bld">The first, wherein was . . .</span>--In <a href="/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.">Hebrews 9:6</a>, when the writer passes from place to ministration, he uses the present tense, although it is of the Tabernacle that he is speaking. The explanation is that which has come before us again and again: the arrangements prescribed in Scripture are to him ever present, abiding from age to age in that unchanging word. Hence probably we should here read <span class= "ital">are</span> instead of "were." The golden candlestick, the table, and the showbread <span class= "ital">are</span> in the Holy Place as it is described in the Law. With the symbolical meaning of the furniture of the Holy Place we are not here concerned. The writer contents himself with words which plainly imply that none of the parts and arrangements of the Tabernacle were without significance. On the golden candlestick (more strictly, <span class= "ital">lampstand</span>) see <a href="/context/exodus/25-31.htm" title="And you shall make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.">Exodus 25:31-37</a>, and on the ten candlesticks of the Temple of Solomon, <a href="/1_kings/7-49.htm" title="And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,">1Kings 7:49</a>; on the table and the showbread, <a href="/context/exodus/25-23.htm" title="You shall also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.">Exodus 25:23-30</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/24-5.htm" title="And you shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.">Leviticus 24:5-9</a> (<a href="/1_kings/7-48.htm" title="And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained to the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the show bread was,">1Kings 7:48</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/4-8.htm" title="He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basins of gold.">2Chronicles 4:8</a>). It is somewhat remarkable that the table should here be so distinctly mentioned, for usually (both in the Bible and in Jewish tradition) no special importance appears to be assigned to it apart from the offering which was placed thereon. (Comp., however, <a href="/leviticus/24-6.htm" title="And you shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure table before the LORD.">Leviticus 24:6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-11.htm" title="And they burn to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the show bread also set they in order on the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but you have forsaken him.">2Chronicles 13:11</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-7.htm" title="You offer polluted bread on my altar; and you say, Wherein have we polluted you?

The account of them is from the Pentateuch, and describes them as they originally were. In the then existing temple there were neither ark, mercy-seat, nor cherubim, though the ceremonies were continued as though they had been still there. The ark had been removed or destroyed in the sack by the Chaldeans, and was never replaced (for the Jewish tradition on the subject, see 2 Macc. 2:1-8). Josephus says ('Bell. Jud.,' 5:05. 5) that in the temple of his day there was nothing whatever behind the veil in the holy of holies; and Tacitus informs us ('Hist.,' v 9) that, when Pompey entered the temple, he found there "vacuam sedem et inania arcana." A stone basement is said by the rabbis to have occupied the ark's place, called "lapis fundationis." In the "first tabernacle," called "the holy place" (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> probably, not <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a neuter plural, equivalent to "the holies"), the table of shewbread (with its twelve loaves in two rows, changed weekly) stood on the north side, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the right as one approached the veil; and opposite to it, on the left, the seven-branched golden candlestick, or lamp-stand, carrying an oil-lamp on each branch (<a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25, 37, 40</a>.). Between them, close to the veil stood the golden altar of incense (ibid.); which, nevertheless, is not mentioned here as part of the furniture of the "first tabernacle," being associated with the "second," for reasons which will be seen. The "second veil" was that between the holy place and the holy of holies (<a href="/exodus/36-35.htm">Exodus 36:35</a>), the curtain at the entrance of the holy place (<a href="/exodus/36-37.htm">Exodus 36:37</a>) being regarded as the first. The inner sanctuary behind this second veil is spoken of as <span class="accented">having</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) in the first place "a golden <span class="accented">censer</span>," as the word <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is translated in the A.V. (so also in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">thuribulum</span>). But it assuredly means the" golden altar of incense," though this stood locally outside the veil. For <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> otherwise there would be no mention at all of this altar, which was so important in the symbolism of the tabernacle, and so prominent in the Pentateuch, from which the whole description is taken. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The alternative view of its being a censer reserved for the use of the high priest, when he entered behind the veil on the Day of Atonement, has no support from the Pentateuch, in which no such censer is mentioned as part of the standing furniture of the tabernacle, and none of <span class="accented">gold is</span> spoken of at all; nor, had it been so, would it have been placed, any more than the altar of incense, <span class="accented">within</span> the veil, since the high priest required it <span class="accented">before</span> he entered. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Though the word itself, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, certainly means" censer," and not "altar of incense," in the LXX., yet in the Hellenistic writers it is otherwise. Philo and Josephus, and also Clemens Alexandrinus and Origen, always call the altar of incense <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>; and the language of the Epistle is Hellenistic.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/9-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">A tabernacle</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(sk&#275;n&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4633.htm">Strong's 4633: </a> </span><span class="str2">A tent, booth, tabernacle, abode, dwelling, mansion, habitation.
