His name means "king of righteousness," which is significant in understanding his typology as a precursor to Christ. He is mentioned in <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, which is a messianic psalm, and is further expounded upon in <a href="/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>, where he is compared to Jesus Christ, emphasizing his eternal priesthood.<p><b>was king of Salem</b><br>Salem is traditionally identified with Jerusalem, a city of great significance throughout biblical history. The name "Salem" means "peace," and Melchizedek's role as king of Salem prefigures Christ's role as the Prince of Peace. Jerusalem later becomes the central place of worship for the Israelites, housing the Temple where sacrifices were made.<p><b>and priest of God Most High</b><br>Melchizedek is unique in that he is both a king and a priest, a dual role that was uncommon in Israelite tradition, where the monarchy and priesthood were separate. This dual role foreshadows Jesus Christ, who is both King and High Priest. The title "God Most High" (El Elyon) emphasizes the supreme sovereignty of God, a theme that runs throughout Scripture.<p><b>He met Abraham</b><br>The meeting between Melchizedek and Abraham is significant as it establishes Melchizedek's authority and his recognition by Abraham, the patriarch of Israel. This encounter is a pivotal moment that underscores the importance of Melchizedek's priesthood, which is not based on lineage or law but on divine appointment.<p><b>returning from the slaughter of the kings</b><br>This refers to the events in <a href="/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>, where Abraham rescues his nephew Lot and defeats the coalition of kings. This victory demonstrates God's favor and blessing upon Abraham, and it sets the stage for his encounter with Melchizedek, who acknowledges Abraham's success and God's role in it.<p><b>and blessed him</b><br>Melchizedek's blessing of Abraham is significant because it shows his spiritual authority and the recognition of God's work in Abraham's life. In biblical tradition, the greater blesses the lesser, indicating Melchizedek's superior spiritual status. This blessing prefigures the blessings that come through Christ, who is a priest in the order of Melchizedek, as stated in <a href="/hebrews/7-17.htm">Hebrews 7:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/melchizedek.htm">Melchizedek</a></b><br>A mysterious figure in the Bible, Melchizedek is both a king and a priest.

"abideth a priest continually;" the connection with the last chapter, therefore, is very clear. Of Melchizedek we know nothing beyond what we learn from the brief narrative of Genesis 14. A Jewish legend, preserved in the later Targums on the Pentateuch, but not in the Targum of Onkelos, identifies him with the patriarch Shem; and many conjectures of a later date (stimulated by the remarkable language of these verses) have been far wilder in their extravagance. It may be that the result of these speculations has been to invest this chapter with a mystery which does not belong to it. The object of the writer is, in reality, very simple--to deal with the question, What is the import of the divine utterance that David's Lord is a "Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek"? Not to take up the history of Melchizedek and allegorise each part, but to point out the full meaning of the comparison made in the prophecy, which declares the priesthood of the future King to be "after the order of Melchizedek--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to be such as the priesthood of Melchizedek typically set forth. The first part of this sentence (<a href="/context/hebrews/7-1.htm" title="For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;">Hebrews 7:1-2</a>, as far as ". . . tenth part of all") enumerates the known facts of the history of Melchizedek; the following clauses are occupied with the interpretation of the history, and with inferences from it. Of the facts recorded in Genesis none are passed over, except the gift of bread and wine; the blessing also is mentioned in general terms only. The language of the LXX. is, as a rule, closely followed throughout.<p><span class= "bld">King of Salem.</span>--Jewish tradition affirms strongly that this Salem occupied the site on which Jerusalem afterwards stood; and certainly Salem is a poetic name of Jerusalem (<a href="/psalms/76-2.htm" title="In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.">Psalm 76:2</a>). This tradition, found in Josephus and in the earliest of the Targums, agrees well with the circumstances of the narrative as far as we can follow them, and seems to deserve acceptance. Jerome maintained that Salem was situated near Scythopolis, where in his day were pointed out ruins of "Melchizedek's palace." Another tradition (probably of Samaritan origin) makes Mount Gerizim the place of meeting, in which case the city of Melchizedek would probably be near Shechem.<p><span class= "bld">The most high God.</span>--A title characteristic of the narrative (<a href="/context/genesis/14-18.htm" title="And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.">Genesis 14:18-20</a>; <a href="/genesis/14-22.htm" title="And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,">Genesis 14:22</a>). Melchizedek is the first who in Scripture is spoken of as priest, and the name is given without explanation. As in the earliest times this office was held by the head of a family (Job 1), it is not remarkable to find a union of regal and sacerdotal functions in the same man. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this Melchizedek, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all</span> (this description belongs to the subject of the sentence, being merely a recapitulation of the facts recorded in Genesis, the language of the LXX. being used; what follows belongs properly to the predicate, being of the nature of a comment on the facts recorded); <span class="cmt_word">first, being by interpretation King of righteousness</span> (which is the meaning of the name Melchizedek), <span class="cmt_word">and then also King of Salem, which is, King of peace</span> (the very names of himself and his kingdom are significant (cf. <a href="/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-3.htm">Psalm 72:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>; <a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>); where righteousness and peace are the characteristics of the Messiah's kingdom; this significance, however, is not afterwards made a point of, being merely noticed by the way); <span class="cmt_word">without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</span> It is this language especially that has been supposed to involve something more than human about the historical Melchizedek. But we have only to enter into the mind of the writer to see that it is not so. For it is the ideal of the psalm, conceived as suggested by the historical type, that gives its color to the language used. And, indeed, how strangely suggestive is that fragment about the priestly king (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-21</a>) so unexpectedly interposed in the life of Abraham! In the midst of a history in which such a point is made of the parentage and descent of the patriarchs of Israel, at a time of peculiar glory of the first and greatest of them, one suddenly appears on the scene, a priest and king, not of the peculiar race at all, his parentage and ancestry unrecorded and unknown, who blesses and receives tithes from Abraham, and then as suddenly disappears from view. We hear no more of him; as about his origin, so about his end, Scripture is silent. And so he "abides" before the mind's eye, apart from any before or after, the type of an unchanging priesthood. For the meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (in itself denoting the absence, not of ancestors, but of a traced genealogy), cf. ver. 6, 6 <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. That of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, is illustrated by the Latin expression, "Nullis majoribus ortus." On "made like (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) unto the Son of God," Chrysostom says, "We know of no beginning or end in either case; in the one, because none are recorded; in the other, because they do not exist." The idea seems to be that Melchizedek is thus assimilated to Christ in the sacred record, by what it leaves untold no less than by what it tells. It is not said that he is like him (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), but made like (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> represented in such wise as to resemble him. It may be here remarked that, though the term "Son of God" is used in the Epistle generally to denote the Messiah as manifested in time, his essential eternal being is here, as elsewhere, distinctly intimated; also that "the Son of God" is regarded as the archetype of the comparison: "Non dicitur Filius DEI assimilatus Melchizedeko, sed contra; nam Filius DEI est antiquior et archetypus" (Bengel). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/7-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Houtos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Melchizedek</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#949;&#955;&#967;&#953;&#963;&#941;&#948;&#949;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(Melchisedek)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3198.htm">Strong's 3198: </a> </span><span class="str2">Melchizedek, king and priest of Salem.
