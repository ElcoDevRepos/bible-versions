"In the light" refers to the spiritual illumination and understanding that comes from knowing Christ (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). The early days of faith are often marked by zeal and fervor, reminiscent of the church in Ephesus, which was urged to remember its first love (<a href="/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4-5</a>). This remembrance serves as a call to perseverance and faithfulness, encouraging believers to hold onto the truths they first embraced.<p><b>In those days, you endured a great conflict in the face of suffering.</b><br>The early Christian community faced significant persecution and trials, as seen in the Book of Acts and the epistles. This "great conflict" likely refers to both external persecution from authorities and societal rejection, as well as internal struggles within the church. The suffering endured by these early Christians is a testament to their faith and commitment, echoing the experiences of the apostles and early church leaders (<a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>).
