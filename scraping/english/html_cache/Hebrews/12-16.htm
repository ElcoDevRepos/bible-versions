Sexual immorality is often condemned in Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>, where believers are urged to flee from sexual sin. The call to vigilance ("See to it") implies a communal responsibility within the church to uphold moral standards. In the cultural context of the early church, sexual immorality was prevalent in Greco-Roman society, making this admonition particularly relevant. The emphasis on purity reflects the call to holiness found throughout the New Testament.<p><b>or is godless like Esau</b><br>Esau is used as an example of godlessness, highlighting his lack of spiritual discernment and disregard for sacred matters. In <a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>, Esau's decision to sell his birthright for a meal demonstrates a prioritization of immediate physical needs over spiritual inheritance. This act is seen as a rejection of the covenantal blessings associated with the birthright, which included leadership of the family and a double portion of the inheritance. Esau's actions are contrasted with the faithfulness expected of believers, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, which lists examples of faith.<p><b>who for a single meal sold his birthright</b><br>This phrase underscores the gravity of Esau's decision, emphasizing the triviality of what he gained compared to what he lost. The birthright in ancient Near Eastern culture was a significant privilege, often linked to the Abrahamic covenant and God's promises. Esau's choice reflects a lack of foresight and spiritual appreciation, serving as a cautionary tale for believers to value their spiritual inheritance. This narrative is a type of Christ, as Jesus, the firstborn over all creation (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>), did not forsake His divine mission for temporary gain.

Esau is appropriately adduced as a notable instance in the Old Testament of a person thus profane, and especially, in the way of warning, of one who lost irrecoverably the privileges which in his profaneness he had scorned. It is immaterial whether Esau himself is intended to be designated as a fornicator (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) as well as profane (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The essential moral of his history is this: being the firstborn of Israel, and so the primary inheritor of the promises made to Abraham, he set no store by the privilege, and so lost it irretrievably. In early life he so lightly esteemed his birthright as the eldest born (carrying with it, as is supposed, in the patriarchal age, the priesthood of the family, and in his case, as might be presumed, the custody and transmission of the promises) that he parted with it for the gratification of a passing appetite. His words on that occasion expressed the limit of his aims and interests: "Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?" Later in life he nevertheless presented himself to claim the blessing of the firstborn from his dying father, but found that he had been forestalled. It does not appear that he had meanwhile changed his mode of life or made amends for his former carelessness; still, he felt now that he had lost something worth having, and was grieved exceedingly. But not even his "great and exceeding bitter cry" availed then to recover what was forfeited. And so neither he nor his seed had part or lot in the Abrahamic promises: the time of opportunity was gone forever. There is some doubt with regard to the latter part of ver. 17, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as to whether "it" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>) in "he sought it" refers to "repentance" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) or to "the blessing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as to what "place of repentance" means. If "it" refers to "repentance," it is difficult to see how Esau's own repentance can be meant; for not only does seeking repentance with tears seem in itself to imply the capability of it, but also the "great and exceeding bitter cry" to which allusion is made was, not because he could not himself repent, but because he could not get the blessing. Hence, if "it" refers to "repentance," it must be repentance, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> change of mind, in Isaac that is meant, or rather in God, against whose will Isaac could not go; cf. "God is not a man... that he should repent" (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). Of such change of mind and purpose it may be meant that Esau found no place. This seems to be the view of many modern interpreters, though not of Bengel, De Wette, Bleek, Hofmann, Delitzsch, Alford, or of Luther, Calvin, Grotius, or any of the Greek Fathers. Against it is the consideration that such is not the more obvious meaning of "he found no place of repentance," taken by itself, especially as <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is always elsewhere in the New Testament (though not always in the LXX.) used for a person's change of mind with respect to his own misdoings (cf. <span class="accented">supra</span>, <span class="accented">Hebrews</span> 6:6). Difficulty on this ground is removed if, taking the clause, "for he found no place of repentance," as parenthetical, we refer <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, preceding. This is by no means a forced construction of the sentence, and it is supported (as above intimated) by the fact that in Genesis it is the blessing itself that Esau is expressly said to have craved in his "great and exceeding bitter cry:" "Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, <span class="accented">even</span> me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept." Thus we may render either, "When he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of change of mind in the bestower of the blessing], though he sought it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> such change of mind] with tears;" or, "When he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected (for he found no place of repentance), though he sought it [i.e. the blessing] with tears." If, the latter rendering being adopted, Esau's own repentance be intended, the idea maybe, either that there was no place left in which even a real repentance could avail, or that of a real repentance he had become incapable; for his tears might be those only of vexation and remorse, not expressing any more appreciation than before of the birthright in its religious aspect. Ebrard's remark, that his conduct as related in <a href="/genesis/33.htm">Genesis 33</a>, shows "a changed heart," and hence a true repentance, is not to the point. For all that there appears is that he had got over his angry feeling towards his brother; it is by no means implied - rather the contrary - that he would have preferred his destiny to his own, or that his views of life had risen above thoughts of worldly prosperity. We observe, further, that nothing is implied one way or the other as to Esau's own salvation; it is only the privilege of being the patriarch of the chosen seed that he is said to have thus irrecoverably forfeited. But his example is adduced as a warning to Christians with regard to their still more precious inheritance, which does involve their own eternal prospects. The warning to them is similar to those of <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc., and <a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26</a>, etc., to the effect that sacred privileges, if persistently slighted, may be lost beyond recovery. And if the passage before us seems to imply, according to one view of it, what the former ones were found not to do, the possible inefficacy of a true repentance, however late, - we may say that, even if this is implied of Esau with respect to his lost blessing, it is not therefore necessarily implied of Christians with respect to their personal salvation; or that, if it is implied of them, it is not till their probation in this life is over that a "place of repentance" in this sense can for them be found no more (cf. the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a>, etc.); also <a href="/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>, etc.; <a href="/luke/13-24.htm">Luke 13:24</a>, etc.). One of Dr. Newman's Parochial Sermons ("Life the Season of Repentance," vol. 6. 'Sermon' 2) strikingly sets forth this view. See also 'Christian Year' (Second Sunday in Lent), with the appended note: "Esau's probation, as far as his birthright was concerned, was quite over when he uttered the cry in the text. His despondency, therefore, is not parallel to anything on this side the grave." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/12-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[See to it] that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#942;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
