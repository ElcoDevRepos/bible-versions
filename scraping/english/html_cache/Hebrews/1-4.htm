In Jewish tradition, angels were highly revered as messengers of God, often associated with delivering divine law and guidance (e.g., the giving of the Law at Sinai, <a href="/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>). However, the author of Hebrews asserts that Jesus, through His resurrection and ascension, has been elevated to a position far superior to that of any angel. This superiority is rooted in His divine nature and His role as the Son of God, which is a central theme in the New Testament (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>). The superiority of Christ over angels is also a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being seated at the right hand of God.<p><b>as the name He has inherited is excellent beyond theirs</b><br>The "name" referred to here is significant in biblical context, often representing authority, character, and identity. In the ancient world, names held great power and meaning. The name Jesus has inherited is understood to be "Son," which is a title that signifies His unique relationship with the Father, distinct from that of angels who are referred to as "sons of God" in a more general sense (<a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>). This inheritance is not merely a title but an affirmation of His divine sonship and authority (<a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>). The excellence of His name is further highlighted in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>, where it is stated that God has given Him "the name that is above every name." This reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah's eternal reign and divine status (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of this verse, Jesus is portrayed as superior to the angels, emphasizing His divine nature and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Spiritual beings created by God, often seen as messengers or servants of God.

(For the same Greek form of comparison, see <a href="/hebrews/1-9.htm">Hebrews 1:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-3.htm">Hebrews 3:3</a>.) "<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> ingentem printer caeteros excellentiam denotat" (Bengel). This verse, though, in respect of grammatical construction, it is the conclusion of the exordium, serves as the thesis of the first section of the argument to follow, the drift of which is to show the SON'S superiority to the angels. The mention of the angels comes naturally after the allusion to <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>, viewed and quoted as it is afterwards in connection with <a href="/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>, in which "<span class="accented">a little lower than</span> the angels" is taken to denote the state <span class="accented">previous</span> to the exaltation; and it is preparatory also for the argument that follows. The more distinguished name, expressing the measure of superiority to the angels, is (as the sequel shows) the name of SON, assigned (as aforesaid) to the Messiah in prophecy, and so, with all that it implies, "inherited" by him in time according to the Divine purpose. Observe the perfect, "hath inherited," instead of the aorist as hitherto, denotes, with the usual force of the Greek tense, the continuance of the inheritance obtained. If we have entered into the view all along taken by the writer, we shall see no difficulty in the SON being said to have <span class="accented">become</span> better than the angels at the time of his exaltation, as though he had been below them before. So he had in respect of his assumed humanity, and it is to the SON denoted in prophecy to be humanly manifested in time that the whole sentence in its main purport refers. As such, having been, with us, lower than the angels, he <span class="accented">became</span> greater, the interposed references to his eternal personality retaining their full force notwithstanding. But why should the name of SON in itself imply superiority to the angels? Angels themselves are, in the Old Testament, called "sons of God." It has been suggested that the writer of the Epistle was not aware of the angels being so designated, since the LXX., from which he invariably quotes, renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. But this is not so invariably. In <a href="/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>; and Psalms 89:7, we find <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. And, whatever be the application of the words in each of these passages, they at any rate occur in the LXX. as denoting others than the Messiah. Nor, in any case, would it be easily supposable that one so versed in biblical lore as the writer must have been had been thus misled in so important a point of his argument. The fact is that his argument, properly understood, is quite consistent with a full knowledge of the fact that others as well as the Messiah are so designated. For it is not merely the term "Son" as applied to the Messiah in prophecy, but the unique manner in which it is so applied, that is insisted on in what follows. The form of his commencement shows this. He does not say, "Whom, except the Messiah, did he ever call Son?" but, "To which of the angels did he ever speak as follows, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee?" In language generally the meaning of a word may depend very materially on the context in which it occurs and other determining circumstances. Indeed, the mere use of the title in the singular, "my Son," carries with it a different idea from its use in the plural of a class of beings. But this is not all. A series of passages from the Old Testament is adduced by way of expressly showing that the sonship assigned to the Messiah carries with it the idea of a relation to God altogether beyond any ever assigned to angels. Such is the position of the writer. We shall see in the sequel how He makes it good. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/1-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So] He became</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(genomenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as far</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</span> <span class="translit">(tosout&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Dative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5118.htm">Strong's 5118: </a> </span><span class="str2">So great, so large, so long, so many.
