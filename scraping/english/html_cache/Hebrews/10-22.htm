In the context of the Old Testament, only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies once a year. However, through Christ's sacrifice, all believers are now encouraged to draw near to God. This reflects the new covenant, where the barrier between God and humanity has been removed (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p><b>with a sincere heart</b><br>A sincere heart implies genuine devotion and authenticity in one's relationship with God. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. This sincerity contrasts with the hypocritical worship criticized by prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><b>in full assurance of faith</b><br>This phrase emphasizes complete confidence in God's promises and the efficacy of Christ's atonement. Faith is central to the believer's relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which defines faith as the assurance of things hoped for. This assurance is rooted in the trustworthiness of God and His Word.<p><b>having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience</b><br>The imagery of sprinkling refers to the Old Testament practice of sprinkling blood for purification (<a href="/leviticus/16-14.htm">Leviticus 16:14-15</a>). In the new covenant, Christ's blood cleanses believers' consciences, freeing them from guilt and enabling them to serve God (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). This cleansing is both a spiritual and moral renewal.<p><b>and our bodies washed with pure water</b><br>This likely alludes to the ritual washings in the Old Testament, such as those required for priests (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18-21</a>). In the New Testament context, it may also symbolize baptism, which represents the believer's identification with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>). The "pure water" signifies the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

In the last words there is a clear allusion to baptism, as the symbol of the new life of purity (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm" title="That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 3:21</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our body washed with pure water.</span> "Let us draw near" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>) is a liturgical phrase, denoting the approach of the people, after ceremonial atonement, to the earthly sanctuary (cf. ver. 1, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>). We may now draw near to the very heavenly mercy-seat, without any sense of a bar to our doing so on the ground of consciousness of sin. In Christ we are to see accomplished all that is needed for atonement. But there are conditions also required in ourselves, expressed first by the "true heart," and the "fullness of faith," and then by the clauses that fellow. These clauses, like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> have a liturgical basis - that of the blood-sprinkling (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> of the people with the blood of the covenant under Mount Sinai, <a href="/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a>, and of the priests on their consecration, <a href="/leviticus/8-23.htm">Leviticus 8:23</a>) and of the ablutions before sacrificial service (<a href="/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4, 24</a>; <a href="/exodus/30.htm">Exodus 30</a>:39). Hence these two participial clauses are not to be separated from each other, and seem best to be both taken in connection with the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>. "Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience" means our having the inward consciousness of debarring sin removed through the blood of Christ; the "full assurance of faith" in the completed atonement, and the "true heart," being presupposed. The conjoined clause, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, etc., is capable also of being figuratively interpreted, in the sense that "our sinful bodies" have been "made clean," so as to be offered through life acceptably as "a living sacrifice," as well as "our souls washed through his most precious blood." And this may be taken as implied. But the terms <span class="accented">body</span> and <span class="accented">water</span> after <span class="accented">hearts</span> and <span class="accented">blood</span> certainly suggest a direct reference to baptism. And such definite allusion is in keeping with references elsewhere to the beginning of the Christian life (see <a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>; <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3, 4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>). The passage last referred to is apposite to that before us in that with an undoubted mention of baptism is conjoined "the answer of a good <span class="accented">conscience</span> toward God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/10-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">let us draw near</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#961;&#967;&#974;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(proserch&#333;metha)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Subjunctive Middle or Passive - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4334.htm">Strong's 4334: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pros and erchomai; to approach, i.e. come near, visit, or worship, assent to.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a sincere</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#953;&#957;&#8134;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(al&#275;thin&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_228.htm">Strong's 228: </a> </span><span class="str2">True (lit: made of truth), real, genuine.
