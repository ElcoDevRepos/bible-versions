According to the Law of Moses, the Israelites were required to give a tenth of their produce and livestock to the Levites as a tithe (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>). This system was established to support the Levites, who did not have a land inheritance like the other tribes. The phrase "mortal men" emphasizes the human and temporal nature of the Levitical priesthood. The Levites, being human, were subject to death, highlighting the impermanence of their priestly service. This sets the stage for a contrast with Melchizedek, whose priesthood is portrayed as eternal.<p><b>but in the case of Melchizedek,</b><br>Melchizedek is a mysterious figure who appears in <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a> as the king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He blesses Abram and receives a tithe from him. Melchizedek's name means "king of righteousness," and his title as king of Salem is often associated with Jerusalem, meaning "peace." His dual role as king and priest prefigures the messianic role of Jesus Christ, who is both King and High Priest. The lack of genealogical record for Melchizedek in Scripture adds to his enigmatic nature and serves as a type of Christ, whose priesthood is not based on ancestry.<p><b>it is affirmed that he lives on.</b><br>The affirmation that Melchizedek "lives on" is not a literal statement about his physical life but rather a theological assertion about the nature of his priesthood. Unlike the Levitical priests, whose service ended with their death, Melchizedek's priesthood is depicted as eternal. This is further expounded in <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, where it is prophesied that the Messiah would be "a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek." The author of Hebrews uses this to illustrate the superiority of Christ's priesthood, which, like Melchizedek's, is eternal and unending. This eternal aspect is crucial for understanding the permanence and sufficiency of Christ's intercession for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/melchizedek.htm">Melchizedek</a></b><br>A mysterious figure in the Bible, Melchizedek is both a king and priest who appears in <a href="/bsb/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>.

"There," in the history now considered, one (receives tithes) of whom the Scripture simply witnesses that he lives.
