In the context of the Jewish priesthood, the high priest was the mediator between God and the people, offering sacrifices for sins. Jesus, as the ultimate high priest, fulfills this role perfectly. The term "befits" suggests that Jesus is exactly what humanity needs, aligning with the divine plan for redemption. This echoes the Old Testament priesthood but surpasses it, as Jesus' priesthood is eternal and perfect, unlike the temporary and flawed Levitical priesthood.<p><b>One who is holy,</b><br>The holiness of Jesus is central to His role as high priest. In the Old Testament, priests had to be consecrated and set apart for their duties, but Jesus' holiness is inherent and absolute. This holiness is a reflection of His divine nature, being both fully God and fully man. His holiness is also a fulfillment of the messianic prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describe the Messiah as pure and without sin.<p><b>innocent,</b><br>The innocence of Jesus refers to His sinlessness. Unlike the Levitical priests who had to offer sacrifices for their own sins, Jesus was without sin and therefore did not need to atone for Himself. This innocence is crucial for His role as the perfect sacrifice, as only a spotless offering could atone for the sins of humanity. This connects to <a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>, which states that Jesus "committed no sin, and no deceit was found in His mouth."<p><b>undefiled,</b><br>Being undefiled means that Jesus was not tainted by sin or corruption. In the cultural context of the time, defilement could come from various sources, including contact with the dead or unclean foods. Jesus remained pure in all aspects, maintaining His purity despite living in a sinful world. This purity is essential for His role as the mediator, as it ensures that He can stand before God on behalf of humanity without blemish.<p><b>set apart from sinners,</b><br>This phrase highlights Jesus' separation from the sinful nature of humanity. While He lived among sinners and ministered to them, He was not influenced by sin. This separation is both physical and spiritual, as He maintained His divine nature and mission. It also reflects His role as the ultimate sacrifice, as He was set apart to fulfill God's redemptive plan. This is reminiscent of the Old Testament sacrificial system, where offerings had to be set apart for God.<p><b>and exalted above the heavens.</b><br>The exaltation of Jesus above the heavens signifies His divine authority and position. After His resurrection, Jesus ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God, as described in <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-21</a>. This exaltation confirms His victory over sin and death and His role as the eternal high priest. It also fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, where the Messiah is invited to sit at God's right hand. This exaltation assures believers of His ongoing intercession and sovereign rule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, described as the perfect high priest who is holy, innocent, and exalted.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest.htm">High Priest</a></b><br>In the context of Hebrews, the high priest is a mediator between God and humanity.

In the old covenant the high priest entered the Holy of Holies only once a year (<a href="/leviticus/16-17.htm">Leviticus 16:17</a>); even then, he had to offer sacrifices for his own sins first (<a href="/hebrews/5-3.htm">Hebrews 5:3</a>).

Our assurance rests on a priest whose character matches God&#8217;s own.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>innocent</b><p>&#8220;Innocent&#8221; means blameless&#8212;no wrongdoing at all. Scripture underlines this repeatedly:<p>&#8226; &#8220;He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in His mouth&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Pilate declared, &#8220;I find no basis for a charge against Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38</a>).<p>Because Jesus is innocent, His sacrifice is accepted as the perfect substitute for the guilty (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>undefiled</b><p>&#8220;Undefiled&#8221; carries the idea of being unstained or unpolluted. In the sacrificial system, every offering had to be &#8220;without blemish&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/22-20.htm">Leviticus 22:20</a>). Jesus fulfills that picture:<p>&#8226; He is &#8220;a lamb without blemish or spot&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; His purity remains intact even while bearing our sins (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>).<p>Our confidence is anchored in a priest whom sin could not touch.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>set apart from sinners</b><p>Though He ate with tax collectors and sinners (<a href="/luke/15-1.htm">Luke 15:1&#8211;2</a>), Jesus was &#8220;set apart from sinners&#8221; in the sense that He never joined in their sin.<p>&#8226; &#8220;The ruler of this world has no claim on Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-30.htm">John 14:30</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>His separation is moral, not relational&#8212;He draws near to save while never compromising His purity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>exalted above the heavens</b><p>Finally, <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a> describes Jesus as &#8220;exalted above the heavens.&#8221; After finishing His redemptive work, He:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Is given &#8220;the name above every name&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>This exaltation proves the Father&#8217;s approval of His sacrifice and gives us a living Priest who &#8220;always lives to intercede&#8221; for us (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a> celebrates the unmatched fitness of Jesus as our high priest: perfectly holy, blameless, untouched by sin, yet compassionate toward sinners, now reigning in the highest place.

The added words carry the description farther still. The thought of high priest immediately brings to mind the annual Day of Atonement, to which belonged the characteristic ministration of the high priest. As we read the following words we cannot doubt their direct reference to the ceremonial observances of that day.<p><span class= "bld">Holy.</span>--Not the word of <a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>, but a word seldom used in the New Testament (except in quotations), though of frequent occurrence in the LXX. (as in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-8.htm" title="And of Levi he said, Let your Thummim and your Urim be with your holy one, whom you did prove at Massah, and with whom you did strive at the waters of Meribah;">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/4-3.htm" title="But know that the LORD has set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call to him.">Psalm 4:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm" title="For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Psalm 16:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-9.htm" title="Let your priests be clothed with righteousness; and let your saints shout for joy.">Psalm 132:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-16.htm" title="I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.">Psalm 132:16</a>): the idea contained is that of <span class= "ital">holy purity.</span> The next word may denote either freedom from malice or evil, or freedom from guile (<a href="/romans/16-18.htm" title="For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.">Romans 16:18</a>); the former meaning is more likely here. The three words, denoting personal purity and innocence and freedom from all pollution of sin, present the idea of which the ceremonial purity of the high priest was the type. Seven days before the Day of Atonement the high priest left his house and took up his abode in the Temple, that, thus separated from men and things unclean, he might when the day arrived be found free from all defilement; five washings and ten purifications were required of him on the day itself. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For such a High Priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens.</span> Such a High Priest, it is said, for us was fitting. The same word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span> was used in <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>, where the humiliation of Christ was spoken cf. It was there said that to make the Captain of our salvation perfect through suffering "became" God - was befitting to what we conceive of the Divine nature. It is now said that our High Priest's being such as is here described "became" us - was befitting to our state and needs. That he should be both human and superhuman was in all respects fitting - the one that he might be our sympathizing brother; the other that his intercession might avail. The further description of him in this verse is suggested by the qualifications of the Aaronic high priest, what they typified being realized in Christ.
