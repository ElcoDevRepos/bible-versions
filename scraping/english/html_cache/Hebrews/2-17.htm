The term "brothers" refers to humanity, highlighting Jesus' full identification with mankind. This is rooted in the doctrine of the Incarnation, where Jesus took on human nature (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The phrase "in every way" underscores that Jesus experienced the full range of human conditions, yet without sin (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>). This was essential for Him to be a representative and substitute for humanity, fulfilling the requirements of the law (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a>).<p><b>so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God</b><br>The role of the high priest in the Old Testament was to mediate between God and the people, offering sacrifices for sins (Leviticus 16). Jesus, as the ultimate High Priest, is both merciful and faithful. His mercy is shown in His compassion and understanding of human weakness, having lived as a man. His faithfulness is demonstrated in His obedience to God's will, even unto death (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>). This priesthood is superior to the Levitical priesthood, as it is eternal and perfect (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a>).<p><b>in order to make atonement for the sins of the people</b><br>Atonement refers to the reconciliation between God and humanity, achieved through the sacrificial death of Jesus. In the Old Testament, atonement was made through animal sacrifices, which were temporary and symbolic (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). Jesus' sacrifice was once for all, providing a complete and permanent solution for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). This fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who would bear the iniquities of many.

The order of the Greek words throws an emphasis on "compassionate" which is in full harmony with what we have seen to be the pervading tone of the chapter. One who has not so understood the infirmities of his brethren as to be "compassionate," cannot be their "faithful" representative before God. But the word "faithful" is still more closely connected with the following words. If through the power of sympathy which the Saviour has gained "by sufferings" He becomes "compassionate" as our High Priest, it is through "the suffering of death" (<a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>) that He proves Himself "the faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation (or rather, <span class= "ital">propitiation</span>) for the sins of the people." The word "high priest," hereafter to be so prominent in the Epistle, is brought in somewhat suddenly, but several expressions in this chapter (see also <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>) have prepared for and led up to the crowning thought here brought before us. The characteristic function of the high priest was his presentation of the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement, that expiation might be made for the sins of the whole people, that the displeasure of God might not rest on the nation on account of sin. (Comp. <a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm" title="For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,">Hebrews 2:11</a>.) The words rendered "propitiate" and "propitiation" are not of frequent occurrence in the New Testament (<a href="/luke/18-13.htm" title="And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.">Luke 18:13</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1John 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-10.htm" title="Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.">1John 4:10</a><a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>), but are very often found in the LXX. The subject receives its full treatment in Hebrews 9, 10. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/2-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hothen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3606.htm">Strong's 3606: </a> </span><span class="str2">From hos with the directive enclitic of source; from which place or source or cause.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He had</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8036;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#333;pheilen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3784.htm">Strong's 3784: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or, its prolonged form opheileo probably from the base of ophelos; to owe; figuratively, to be under obligation; morally, to fail in duty.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to be made like</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#969;&#952;&#8134;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(homoi&#333;th&#275;nai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Infinitive Passive<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3666.htm">Strong's 3666: </a> </span><span class="str2">To make like, liken; I compare.
