The "rest" refers to the spiritual rest and peace found in salvation, echoing the rest God promised to the Israelites in the Promised Land. This rest is a type of the eternal rest believers will experience in heaven. The concept of rest is rooted in the Sabbath rest God instituted at creation (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>) and is fulfilled in Christ, who offers rest for the soul (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>). The present tense "enter" indicates an ongoing process, suggesting that believers begin to experience this rest now, even as they anticipate its fullness in the future.<p><b>As for the others, it is just as God has said:</b><br>This phrase introduces a contrast between believers and those who do not enter God's rest due to unbelief. The "others" refers to the Israelites who, despite witnessing God's miracles, failed to trust Him and thus were denied entry into the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22-23</a>). This serves as a warning to the readers of Hebrews, urging them to remain faithful and not harden their hearts. The author of Hebrews frequently uses Old Testament examples to illustrate spiritual truths, reinforcing the continuity of God's message throughout Scripture.<p><b>&#8220;So I swore on oath in My anger, &#8216;They shall never enter My rest.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This quotation is from <a href="/psalms/95-11.htm">Psalm 95:11</a>, which reflects God's response to the Israelites' rebellion in the wilderness. God's oath underscores the seriousness of unbelief and disobedience. The use of "My rest" indicates that the rest is God's own, a divine gift that He offers to His people. The historical context of this oath is the Israelites' refusal to trust God at Kadesh Barnea, leading to their 40 years of wandering (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-34.htm">Deuteronomy 1:34-35</a>). This serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of rejecting God's promises.<p><b>And yet His works have been finished since the foundation of the world.</b><br>This phrase highlights the completed nature of God's creative work, referencing <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>, where God rested on the seventh day. Theologically, it suggests that God's plan for rest was established from the beginning of creation. This rest is not due to weariness but signifies the completion and perfection of His work. The author of Hebrews uses this to illustrate that God's rest is available and has been part of His divine purpose from the start. It also points to the sufficiency of Christ's redemptive work, which believers enter into by faith, paralleling the finished work of creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those who have faith in Jesus Christ and are promised rest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being who offers rest and swore an oath regarding His rest.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people who, due to unbelief, were denied entry into God's rest.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The event referenced as the time when God's works were finished.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_rest.htm">Promised Rest</a></b><br>The spiritual rest offered to believers, symbolized by the rest God took after creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_as_the_key_to_rest.htm">Faith as the Key to Rest</a></b><br>Belief in Christ is essential to entering God's rest.

Believers already taste it and will one day enjoy it fully. Those who refuse faith remain outside, exactly as God has warned. The passage calls every reader to trust the finished work of Christ and step into the Sabbath-joy prepared since the foundation of the world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">For we which have believed.</span>--The emphasis is two-fold, resting both on "believed" and on "we enter." The former looks back to <a href="/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.">Hebrews 4:2</a>, "by faith"<span class= "ital">--"for</span> it is we who believed that enter." . . . The latter looks forward to the remainder of the verse, the purport of which is that the rest exists, and that "entering into the rest" may still be spoken of.<p><span class= "bld">As I have sworn . . .</span>--Rather (as above), <span class= "ital">as I sware in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest, </span>(See <a href="/hebrews/3-11.htm" title="So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)">Hebrews 3:11</a>.) If in the Scripture (<a href="/psalms/95-8.htm" title="Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:">Psalm 95:8</a>) God warns men of a later age not to imitate the guilt of those whom He excluded from His rest, it follows (see below on <a href="/hebrews/4-10.htm" title="For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his.">Hebrews 4:10</a>) that the time for entering into the rest of God was not then past and gone.<p><span class= "bld">Although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</span>--And therefore the rest into which God will enter with His redeemed people is not that which succeeded the works of creation. This caution is added because the words used by the Psalmist (<a href="/psalms/95-11.htm" title="To whom I swore in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.">Psalm 95:11</a>) are derived from <a href="/context/genesis/2-2.htm" title="And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.">Genesis 2:2-3</a>; though the same words are used, yet, we are reminded, the thought is widely different. The next two verses simply expand and support the thought contained in this: "For whereas we read in one Scripture that God 'rested' on the seventh day, another records His sentence on the disobedient people, 'They <span class= "ital">shall not</span> enter into My rest.'" . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we do enter into the rest, we who have believed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, the historical aorist, pointing to the time when Christians became believers; with a reference also to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> in the preceding verse: but the emphasis is on the first word in the sentence, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>: "For we Christian believers <span class="accented">have</span> an entrance into the rest intended") <span class="cmt_word">even as he hath said, As I sware in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world</span>. This seems to be a concise enunciation of the proof, unfolded in the verses that follow, of the true rest being one into which Christians have still an entrance. The idea is that, though God's own rest had been from the beginning, and man had not yet entered it, yet the possibility of his doing so had not ceased to be intimated: it had continued open potentially to man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/4-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
