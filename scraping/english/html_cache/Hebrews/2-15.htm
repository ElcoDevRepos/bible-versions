In the context of Hebrews, Jesus is portrayed as the ultimate High Priest who offers freedom from spiritual bondage. The concept of freedom is central to the New Testament, echoing themes from the Old Testament, such as the liberation of the Israelites from Egypt. This freedom is not merely physical but spiritual, emphasizing deliverance from sin and its consequences.<p><b>who all their lives</b><br>This indicates the pervasive and lifelong nature of the bondage experienced by humanity. The phrase suggests a universal condition affecting all people, reflecting the biblical teaching that sin and its effects are a constant presence in human life. This aligns with the doctrine of original sin, which posits that all humans are born into a state of sinfulness due to the fall of Adam and Eve.<p><b>were held in slavery</b><br>The imagery of slavery is powerful, evoking the historical context of the Israelites' bondage in Egypt and the Roman practice of slavery during the time the New Testament was written. Spiritually, it refers to the bondage of sin and the law, as discussed in <a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16-18</a>, where Paul speaks of being slaves to sin before becoming slaves to righteousness through Christ.<p><b>by their fear of death</b><br>Fear of death is a universal human experience, often linked to the unknown and the finality of life. In biblical terms, death is not just physical but also spiritual, representing separation from God. The fear of death can be seen as a tool of the devil, as suggested in <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>, where Christ's death is said to destroy the one who holds the power of death. This fear is overcome through the resurrection of Jesus, which promises eternal life to believers, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>, where death is described as being swallowed up in victory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who through His death and resurrection, liberates believers from the fear of death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those who have faith in Christ and are freed from the bondage of the fear of death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devil.htm">The Devil</a></b><br>Implied in the broader context of <a href="/bsb/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>, as the one who holds the power of death, which Christ has overcome.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fear_of_death.htm">The Fear of Death</a></b><br>A universal human experience that enslaves people, which Christ came to conquer.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross_and_resurrection.htm">The Cross and Resurrection</a></b><br>The pivotal events through which Jesus accomplished the liberation from the fear of death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/freedom_from_fear.htm">Freedom from Fear</a></b><br>Jesus' victory over death means believers no longer need to live in fear.

We may well suppose these words to have been prompted by the intense sympathy of the writer with the persecuted and tempted Christians whom he addresses. He writes throughout as one who never forgets their need of sympathetic help, and who knows well the power of the motives, the allurements and the threats, employed to lead them into apostasy. The crushing power of the "fear of death" over those who had not grasped the truth that, in Christ, life and immortality are brought to light, perhaps no thought of ours can reach.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/2-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">free</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#940;&#958;&#8131;</span> <span class="translit">(apallax&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Subjunctive Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_525.htm">Strong's 525: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and allasso; to change away, i.e. Release, remove.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">those</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(toutous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#963;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hosoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3745.htm">Strong's 3745: </a> </span><span class="str2">How much, how great, how many, as great as, as much.
