This act of giving a tenth is significant as it predates the Mosaic Law, indicating the timeless principle of tithing. It demonstrates Abraham's recognition of Melchizedek's spiritual authority and foreshadows the Levitical priesthood's practice. The act of tithing here is an acknowledgment of God's provision and blessing, and it establishes Melchizedek as a type of Christ, who is both king and priest.<p><b>First, his name means &#8220;king of righteousness.&#8221;</b><br>The name Melchizedek is derived from two Hebrew words: "melek" (king) and "tsedeq" (righteousness). This title is significant as it highlights the character and role of Melchizedek, aligning with the messianic prophecy in <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, where the Messiah is a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek. Righteousness is a key attribute of Christ, who is our ultimate King of Righteousness, fulfilling the law and offering Himself as the perfect sacrifice for sin.<p><b>Then also, &#8220;king of Salem&#8221; means &#8220;king of peace.&#8221;</b><br>Salem is traditionally identified with Jerusalem, and the name itself means "peace." This title complements Melchizedek's role as a king of righteousness, as true peace is a result of righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), and His reign brings peace between God and humanity through His atoning work. The dual titles of Melchizedek as king of righteousness and king of peace prefigure the dual role of Christ, who brings both righteousness and peace to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.
