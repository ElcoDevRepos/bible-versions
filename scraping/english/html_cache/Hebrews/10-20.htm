The "new" way contrasts with the old covenant under the Mosaic Law, which required repeated sacrifices and rituals. The "living" way signifies that this path is dynamic and eternal, unlike the temporary and lifeless nature of the old sacrificial system. This new way is characterized by a direct relationship with God, made possible through Jesus' resurrection, which ensures that He is alive and continually interceding for believers. This concept is rooted in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where a new covenant is prophesied, and is fulfilled in Christ as described in the New Testament.<p><b>opened for us</b><br>The opening of this way signifies access to God that was previously unavailable. Under the old covenant, only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place, and only once a year. Jesus' sacrifice tore the veil that separated humanity from God's presence, symbolizing unrestricted access to God for all believers. This act of opening is a fulfillment of the promise of reconciliation between God and humanity, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>, where both Jews and Gentiles have access to the Father through Christ.<p><b>through the curtain</b><br>The curtain, or veil, in the temple separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place, where God's presence dwelt. This barrier represented the separation between God and humanity due to sin. When Jesus died, the curtain in the temple was torn from top to bottom (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), symbolizing the removal of this separation. The tearing of the curtain signifies that through Jesus' sacrifice, believers can now enter into the presence of God with confidence, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>.<p><b>of His body</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the physical sacrifice of Jesus, whose body was broken for the sins of humanity. The body of Christ is often seen as a type of the temple itself, as He referred to His body as the temple in <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>. The breaking of His body parallels the tearing of the temple curtain, both acts signifying the end of the old covenant and the establishment of the new. This sacrificial act fulfills the prophecies of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who would bear the iniquities of many.
