In biblical context, "children" often denotes those who are part of God's family or believers. The mention of "flesh and blood" highlights the human condition, subject to mortality and weakness. This is reminiscent of <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God forms man from the dust, emphasizing the physicality of human life. The phrase sets the stage for understanding the incarnation of Christ, who came to relate to humanity fully.<p><b>He too shared in their humanity</b><br>This phrase underscores the doctrine of the Incarnation, where Jesus Christ, the Son of God, took on human nature. <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a> speaks of Christ emptying Himself and being made in human likeness. This sharing in humanity was necessary for Christ to be the perfect mediator between God and man, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>. It also fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which foretold the coming of Immanuel, "God with us."<p><b>so that by His death</b><br>The purpose of Christ's incarnation is highlighted here&#8212;His death. The death of Christ is central to Christian theology, as it is through His sacrificial death that redemption is achieved. This aligns with the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where the shedding of blood was required for atonement (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). Christ's death is the ultimate fulfillment of these sacrifices, as described in <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>.<p><b>He might destroy him who holds the power of death</b><br>This phrase refers to the defeat of Satan, who is described as having the power of death. In biblical terms, death entered the world through sin, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>. Satan's power is not absolute but is permitted by God, as illustrated in the book of Job. The destruction mentioned here is not annihilation but the breaking of Satan's hold over humanity, achieved through Christ's victory on the cross and His resurrection, as stated in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>.<p><b>that is, the devil</b><br>The devil, or Satan, is identified as the adversary of God and humanity. His role as the accuser and tempter is seen throughout Scripture, from <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> to <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9-10</a>. The devil's defeat is prophesied in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman is foretold to crush the serpent's head. This victory is realized in Christ's work, as He disarms the spiritual rulers and authorities, triumphing over them by the cross (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_children.htm">The Children</a></b><br>Refers to humanity, specifically those who are part of God's family through faith.

His incarnation is central to the passage, highlighting His full participation in human nature.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devil.htm">The Devil</a></b><br>The adversary who holds the power of death. This passage speaks to the spiritual battle and the ultimate defeat of the devil through Christ's death.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>Represents both physical death and spiritual separation from God.

Here the purpose of the Incarnation is set forth as requiring the complete association of the SON with human brethren to which prophecy had pointed. But more is now declared than the prophecies so far quoted have implied; and thus is introduced (by way of anticipation, as is usual in the Epistle) the doctrine of atonement, which is to be dwelt on afterwards. For the object of Christ's becoming one of us is now further said to be that by <span class="accented">dying</span> he might effect <span class="accented">redemption.</span> The "children" in ver. 14 are the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the type in Isaiah, fulfilled in the "many sons" to be "sanctified" and brought to glory. (We may observe, by the way, the difference between the words used of their participation in human nature and of Christ's - <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>: the aorist in the latter case expresses his sharing what was not his before, and so distinctly implies his pre-existence.) For understanding' the account here given of the purpose of the Incarnation, we must remember that <span class="accented">death</span>, originally announced (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>) as the penalty of transgression, is regarded in the New Testament (notably by St. Paul) as the sign of the continual dominion of sin over the human race. Thus in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12, 15</a> the mere fact that all men "from Adam to Moses" had died is adduced as sufficient proof that all were under condemnation as sinners. Whatever further idea is implied in the word "death " - such as alienation from God in whom is life eternal, or any "blackness of darkness" thereupon ensuing in the world beyond the grave - of man's subjection or liability to all this his natural death is regarded as the sign. It is to be remembered, too, that "the devil," through whom it was that sin first entered, and death through sin, is revealed to us generally as the representative of evil (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), and, as such, the primeval manslayer (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), with power given him over death, the penalty of sin, as long as man remains in his dominion, unredeemed. Till redemption cast a new light upon the gloom of death, man was all his life long in fear of it; its shadow was upon him from his birth; it loomed ever before him as a passing into darkness, unrelieved by hope. We know well how the hopeless dismalness of death was a commonplace with the classical poets, and how, even now, the natural man shrinks from it as the last great evil. But Christ, human, yet sinless, died for all mankind, and, so dying, wrested from the devil his power over death, and emancipated believers from their state of "bondage" (as to which, see below). On particular expressions in this passage we may remark: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That, "having the power of death," which has been variously interpreted, may be taken in the usual sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, viz. "having power, or dominion, <span class="accented">over."</span> Satan has had the dominion over death allowed him because of human sin. And it may be observed that elsewhere, not only death, but other woes that flesh is heir to - its precursors and harbingers - are attributed to Satanic agency (cf. <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>; <a href="/john/2-6.htm">John 2:6</a>; <a href="/luke/13-16.htm">Luke 13:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Christ is not here said to have as yet abolished death itself; only to have rendered impotent him that had the power of it; for natural death still "reigns," though to believers it has no "sting." In the end (according to <a href="/1_corinthians/15-26.htm">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>) death itself will be destroyed. In one passage, indeed, it is spoken of by St. Paul as already abolished (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>); but this is in the way of anticipation: death is already vanquished and disarmed to believers. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The bondage (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) spoken of is the condition of unredeemed man, often so designated by St. Paul. See <a href="/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>. and 8, where man's bondage (felt when conscience is awake) to "the law of sin in the members," and his emancipation from it through faith, are described; and especially Romans 8:15, 16, 17 ("For ye have not received the spirit of <span class="accented">bondage</span> again to <span class="accented">fear</span>," etc.), as elucidating  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
