This ritual was a temporary measure, symbolizing the need for a more perfect sacrifice. The blood of animals was insufficient for true atonement, serving as a foreshadowing of the ultimate sacrifice to come. The use of animal blood highlights the limitations of the Old Covenant and the need for a superior, lasting solution.<p><b>but He entered the Most Holy Place once for all by His own blood</b><br>Jesus, as the ultimate High Priest, entered the heavenly sanctuary, not the earthly tabernacle, offering His own blood as the perfect and final sacrifice. This act fulfilled the requirements of the Law and established a New Covenant. The phrase "once for all" emphasizes the completeness and sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice, contrasting with the repeated animal sacrifices under the Old Covenant. His entry into the Most Holy Place signifies the opening of direct access to God for believers, a privilege not available under the Old Covenant.<p><b>thus securing eternal redemption</b><br>The term "eternal redemption" indicates a permanent and complete deliverance from sin, achieved through Christ's sacrifice. Unlike the temporary atonement provided by animal sacrifices, Jesus' offering provides a once-and-for-all solution to the problem of sin. This redemption is not only for the present but extends into eternity, ensuring believers' salvation and reconciliation with God. The concept of eternal redemption is rooted in the promises of the New Covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises to forgive sins and remember
