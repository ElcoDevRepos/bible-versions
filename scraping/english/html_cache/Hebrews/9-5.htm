In the context of the tabernacle and later the temple, they were crafted from gold and placed on the Ark of the Covenant, symbolizing the divine presence and protection. The cherubim's wings overshadowed the mercy seat, representing God's throne on earth. This imagery connects to the vision of God's throne in <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a> and <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>, where cherubim are depicted as part of the heavenly host. The cherubim's presence signifies the holiness and majesty of God, emphasizing the sacredness of the Ark and the covenant it contained.<p><b>overshadowing the mercy seat</b><br>The mercy seat, or "atonement cover," was the lid of the Ark of the Covenant, where the high priest would sprinkle the blood of the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) to atone for the sins of Israel. This act foreshadowed the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice on the cross fulfilled the need for continual animal sacrifices. The term "overshadowing" suggests protection and divine presence, similar to the Holy Spirit overshadowing Mary in <a href="/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>, indicating the inception of Jesus as the ultimate atonement.<p><b>But we cannot discuss these things in detail now</b><br>This phrase indicates the author's intention to focus on the broader theological implications rather than the specifics of the tabernacle's design. The author of Hebrews is more concerned with the spiritual realities these symbols represent, particularly how they point to Christ's superior priesthood and sacrifice. This approach aligns with the overall theme of Hebrews, which emphasizes the fulfillment of the Old Covenant through the New Covenant in Christ. The restraint in detailing suggests a focus on the transformative power of Christ's work rather than the ritualistic aspects of the old system.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings often associated with the presence and glory of God.

The writer reminds us that the Ark of the Covenant sat in the Most Holy Place (<a href="/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33&#8211;34</a>).<p>&#8226; Its position testified that God Himself dwelt with Israel&#8212;He was not distant, but present and enthroned &#8220;between the cherubim&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a> has just listed the ark&#8217;s contents; verse 5 moves our gaze upward, showing that every element of the tabernacle pointed higher than itself&#8212;to the living God who reigns above His covenant promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The cherubim of glory</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Cherubim&#8221; are majestic heavenly beings who serve at God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226;

The &#8220;mercy seat&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/25-17.htm">Exodus 25:17&#8211;22</a>) was the solid-gold cover of the ark where atonement blood was sprinkled each Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-14.htm">Leviticus 16:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226;

<a href="/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Visually, judgment (cherubim) and mercy (blood) meet in one place&#8212;anticipating Christ, whose cross satisfies justice while extending mercy (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We cannot discuss these things in detail now</b><p>&#8226;
