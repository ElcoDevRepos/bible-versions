Moses was revered as the lawgiver and leader who delivered Israel from Egypt and received the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai. In Jewish tradition, Moses is considered the greatest prophet. However, the author of Hebrews emphasizes that Jesus, as the Son of God, surpasses Moses in glory and honor. This comparison highlights Jesus' divine nature and His role as the ultimate mediator of a new covenant, fulfilling and surpassing the old covenant given through Moses. This echoes the transfiguration event (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-8</a>), where Jesus is shown in glory alongside Moses and Elijah, signifying His preeminence.<p><b>just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself</b><br>This analogy illustrates the relationship between Jesus and Moses by comparing it to a builder and a house. In ancient times, a builder was not only a craftsman but often the designer and planner, responsible for the creation and integrity of a structure. The house, while valuable, is a product of the builder's skill and vision. Similarly, Moses is part of God's household, but Jesus is the builder, the one who establishes and sustains the house of God. This metaphor underscores Jesus' role as the creator and sustainer of all things (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>) and His authority over the spiritual house, which is the community of believers (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). It also reflects the wisdom literature, where wisdom is often depicted as a master builder (<a href="/proverbs/9.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>), further associating Jesus with divine wisdom and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, regarded as the Son of God and Savior.
