In the context of the New Testament, Jesus is recognized as the Son of God, a title that signifies His divinity and pre-existence (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>). Despite His divine nature, Jesus took on human form (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-7</a>), which is central to the doctrine of the Incarnation. This dual nature of Christ as both fully God and fully man is a cornerstone of Christian theology. The term "Son" also connects to Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, which speaks of the Messiah as God's Son, and <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, which refers to the coming of a divine child.<p><b>He learned obedience</b><br>This phrase highlights the humanity of Jesus, who, though divine, experienced human life fully, including the process of learning. The concept of learning obedience is significant because it underscores Jesus' role as the perfect model of human behavior. In His earthly life, Jesus submitted to the will of the Father, demonstrating perfect obedience (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19, 30</a>). This obedience is not indicative of any deficiency in Jesus but rather His active participation in the human experience. It also fulfills the typology of the obedient servant found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the suffering servant submits to God's will.<p><b>from what He suffered</b><br>The suffering of Jesus is central to His mission and is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describes the suffering servant who bears the sins of many. Jesus' suffering was not only physical but also spiritual and emotional, as He bore the weight of humanity's sin (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>). This suffering was necessary for His role as the High Priest, who mediates between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). Through suffering, Jesus fully identified with human weakness and temptation, yet remained without sin (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>). His suffering and obedience culminated in His sacrificial death on the cross, which is the foundation of salvation for believers (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jesus is acknowledged as the Son of God.
