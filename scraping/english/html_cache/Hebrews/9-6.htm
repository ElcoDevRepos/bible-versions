The tabernacle, as described in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-31</a>, was a portable earthly sanctuary where God dwelled among His people. The preparation involved specific rituals and offerings, as outlined in Leviticus, to ensure that everything was in accordance with God's commands. This preparation symbolizes the need for purity and order in approaching God, reflecting the holiness required to enter His presence.<p><b>the priests entered regularly into the first room</b><br>The "first room" refers to the Holy Place within the tabernacle, distinct from the Most Holy Place (Holy of Holies). Only priests from the tribe of Levi could enter this area, and they did so daily to maintain the lampstand, table of showbread, and altar of incense (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-8</a>). This regular entry signifies the ongoing nature of the Old Covenant worship, which required continual offerings and rituals. The Holy Place served as a type of Christ, who is the true light (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), the bread of life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), and the intercessor for believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>to perform their sacred duties</b><br>The sacred duties included burning incense, maintaining the lampstand, and replacing the showbread. These acts were not only ritualistic but also symbolic of the spiritual service and intercession required by the priests on behalf of the people. The incense represented prayers ascending to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>), while the lampstand symbolized God's guidance and presence. The showbread, or "bread of the Presence," signified God's provision and fellowship with His people. These duties foreshadowed the ultimate priestly work of Jesus Christ, who fulfills and surpasses these roles as the eternal High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The priests were the descendants of Aaron, tasked with performing the sacred duties in the tabernacle and later in the temple.

had been prepared in this way</b><p><a href="/hebrews/9-6.htm">Hebrews 9:6</a> opens by reminding us that worship under the old covenant never began haphazardly. Every lampstand, table, and curtain had to be arranged &#8220;just as the LORD had commanded&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16-33</a>). The author of Hebrews looks back to that meticulous preparation to underscore two truths:<p>&#8226; God sets the terms for approaching Him; holiness demands careful obedience (<a href="/leviticus/8-4.htm">Leviticus 8:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern hints at Christ, who later declared, &#8220;I am the way&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>) and prepared a better access through His own body (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-20</a>).<p>The tabernacle&#8217;s readiness, therefore, points beyond itself to the perfect &#8220;preparation&#8221; accomplished at the cross.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the priests entered regularly</b><p>Once everything was in order, &#8220;the priests entered regularly.&#8221; Their service was daily (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>) and unending: morning and evening sacrifices, incense at dawn and dusk, lamps tended every night. <a href="/luke/1-8.htm">Luke 1:8-9</a> shows Zechariah still performing this routine centuries later. The repetition underlines the temporary nature of animal sacrifices&#8212;none could finally remove sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11</a>). By contrast, after Jesus offered Himself &#8220;once for all,&#8221; He &#8220;sat down at the right hand of God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>), signaling that His priestly work is complete.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the first room</b><p>The regular traffic stopped at the Holy Place.

That veil powerfully illustrated restricted access. <a href="/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a> ordered it hung &#8220;to separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.&#8221; When Jesus died, &#8220;the veil of the temple was torn in two&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), proclaiming that the barrier was removed. <a href="/hebrews/9-2.htm">Hebrews 9:2</a> lists the furnishings within the first room&#8212;lampstand, table, and consecrated bread&#8212;each foreshadowing better realities found in Christ (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>; 6:35).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to perform their sacred duties</b><p>Their duties were called &#8220;sacred&#8221; because they belonged entirely to the Lord:<p>&#8226; Trimming lamps so the light never went out (<a href="/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Burning fragrant incense, symbolizing the prayers they lifted for the people (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-8</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Replacing the bread of the Presence every Sabbath (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>).<p>All of it illustrated mediation. &#8220;Every high priest is appointed to represent men in matters relating to God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>). Yet even with constant activity, the conscience remained uncleansed; the ceremonies dealt only with externals. They pointed ahead to the once-for-all, fully effective ministry of our Great High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24-26</a>).
