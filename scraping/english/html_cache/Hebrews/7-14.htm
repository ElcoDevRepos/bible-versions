This assertion is based on genealogical records and prophecies that were widely accepted and recognized. The clarity also emphasizes the transparency and undeniability of Jesus' descent, which is crucial for establishing His role and authority.<p><b>that our Lord</b><br>The term "our Lord" signifies the recognition of Jesus Christ as the divine and sovereign ruler. This title affirms His authority and divinity, which are central to Christian belief. It also reflects the early Christian confession of Jesus as Lord, a title that denotes both respect and worship.<p><b>descended from Judah</b><br>Jesus' descent from the tribe of Judah fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, which speaks of the scepter not departing from Judah. This lineage is significant because it aligns with the messianic expectations that the Messiah would come from David's line, who was from the tribe of Judah. The genealogies in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a> trace Jesus' ancestry back to Judah, reinforcing His rightful claim to the throne of David.<p><b>a tribe as to which Moses said nothing about priests</b><br>In the Mosaic Law, the priesthood was designated to the tribe of Levi, specifically the descendants of Aaron (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). The absence of any mention of Judah in relation to the priesthood highlights the uniqueness of Jesus' priesthood. This distinction sets the stage for the argument in Hebrews that Jesus is a priest in the order of Melchizedek, a priesthood that transcends the Levitical order. This new priesthood is not based on tribal lineage but on the power of an indestructible life, as further explained in <a href="/hebrews/7-16.htm">Hebrews 7:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, identified as our Lord in this verse, who descended from the tribe of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_judah.htm">Tribe of Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for producing kings, including King David, and ultimately Jesus Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader who delivered the Law to Israel, which specified the Levitical priesthood from the tribe of Levi.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/levitical_priesthood.htm">Levitical Priesthood</a></b><br>The priestly order established under the Law of Moses, originating from the tribe of Levi.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/melchizedek.htm">Melchizedek</a></b><br>A priest-king mentioned earlier in <a href="/bsb/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>, whose order is used to describe Jesus' eternal priesthood.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_unique_priesthood.htm">Jesus' Unique Priesthood</a></b><br>Unlike the Levitical priests, Jesus' priesthood is based on the order of Melchizedek, emphasizing His eternal and unchangeable role as our High Priest.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' descent from Judah fulfills Old Testament prophecies, affirming the reliability and divine inspiration of Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/royal_and_priestly_roles.htm">Royal and Priestly Roles</a></b><br>Jesus combines the roles of king and priest, offering a complete and perfect mediation between God and humanity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>The unexpected choice of Judah for the Messiah's lineage demonstrates God's sovereign plan, encouraging believers to trust in His wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>As believers, our identity is rooted in Jesus, who transcends traditional roles and offers us a new covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_7_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 7:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_7_14_Judah_lineage_s_priest_role.htm">How does Hebrews 7:14 affirm Jesus' lineage from Judah impact His priesthood role?

The audience shared these convictions, so the argument starts on solid, observable ground.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That our Lord</b><p>Calling Jesus &#8220;our Lord&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>; <a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>) highlights both His deity and His headship over believers. The term also signals authority superior to the Levitical priesthood, echoing <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a> where David calls the Messiah &#8220;Lord,&#8221; placing Him above David himself. The writer is preparing us to see Jesus as a priest whose rank outshines that of Levi&#8217;s sons.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Descended from Judah</b><p>Jesus&#8217; lineage traces through Judah, not Levi. <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-3</a> and <a href="/luke/3-33.htm">Luke 3:33</a> record the genealogy, while <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a> promises, &#8220;The scepter will not depart from Judah.&#8221; <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a> celebrates Him as &#8220;the Lion of the tribe of Judah.&#8221; These passages affirm that Messiah&#8217;s royal&#8212;yet non-priestly&#8212;tribal origin was foretold, underscoring that Jesus fulfills kingship prophecies while simultaneously introducing a new priestly order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A tribe as to which Moses said nothing about priests</b><p>Moses explicitly appointed Aaron and the Levites for priestly service (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-5</a>). Concerning Judah, Moses &#8220;said nothing about priests,&#8221; meaning silence that excludes. By pointing this out, Hebrews stresses that Jesus&#8217; priesthood cannot be Levitical. Instead, as <a href="/hebrews/7-15.htm">Hebrews 7:15-17</a> explains, He is &#8220;a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>), an order based on eternal life rather than ancestry. The silence of the Mosaic Law on Judah&#8217;s priesthood sets the stage for a superior, divinely decreed priest who transcends legal limitations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a> establishes a key truth: everyone knew Jesus came from Judah, a non-priestly tribe under the Law. This acknowledged fact proves His priesthood must arise from a higher, pre-Levitical order&#8212;Melchizedek&#8217;s&#8212;fulfilling Scripture without contradicting it. Jesus is both rightful King from Judah and eternal Priest by divine oath, giving believers unshakeable confidence in the sufficiency of His once-for-all mediation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Evident.</span>--That is to say, manifest before the eyes of all.<p><span class= "bld">Sprang.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">hath arisen out of Judah.</span> In every other place in the New Testament this word is applied to the rising of the sun, the light, the day-star (<a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a>), or the clouds (<a href="/luke/12-54.htm" title="And he said also to the people, When you see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway you say, There comes a shower; and so it is.">Luke 12:54</a>); and in the prophecies of <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm" title="I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.">Numbers 24:17</a> and <a href="/malachi/4-2.htm" title="But to you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and you shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.">Malachi 4:2</a> the same word is used.
