The tabernacle served as a physical and visual teaching tool, pointing to deeper spiritual truths. In the context of Hebrews, the "present time" refers to the era of the New Covenant inaugurated by Christ. The tabernacle's rituals were temporary and preparatory, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Jesus. This aligns with Paul's teaching in <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>, where the law is described as a tutor leading to Christ.<p><b>because the gifts and sacrifices being offered</b><br>The "gifts and sacrifices" refer to the various offerings prescribed in the Mosaic Law, such as burnt offerings, grain offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings (Leviticus 1-7). These were central to the worship and religious life of Israel, serving as a means to maintain a covenant relationship with God. However, they were repetitive and could not provide a permanent solution to sin. This is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>, which states that the law can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.<p><b>were unable to cleanse the conscience of the worshiper</b><br>The inability to cleanse the conscience highlights the limitations of the Old Covenant sacrifices. While they could provide ceremonial cleanliness and temporary atonement, they could not transform the inner person or remove the guilt of sin. This points to the need for a better sacrifice, fulfilled in Christ, who offers a once-for-all sacrifice that purifies the conscience (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). The concept of conscience in biblical terms involves an awareness of sin and the need for true reconciliation with God, which is fully realized in the New Covenant through Jesus' atoning work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The earthly sanctuary described in the Old Testament, where priests offered sacrifices according to the Law of Moses.
