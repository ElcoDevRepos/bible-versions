Sanctification is the process of being made holy, set apart for God's purposes. In the Old Testament, sanctification involved rituals and sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/20-7.htm">Leviticus 20:7-8</a>). Jesus, as the ultimate High Priest, fulfills and surpasses these rituals through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>). His role as sanctifier is rooted in His divine nature and His work on the cross, which provides the means for believers to be made holy.<p><b>and those who are sanctified</b><br>This refers to believers who have accepted Christ's sacrifice and are being made holy through His work. The process of sanctification is ongoing and involves the Holy Spirit's work in a believer's life (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>). Believers are called to live lives that reflect their sanctified status, aligning with God's will and purpose (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><b>are of the same family.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unity and shared identity between Christ and believers. The concept of family in biblical times was central to one's identity and social structure. By stating that believers are of the same family as Christ, it highlights the intimate relationship and inheritance they share with Him (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). This familial bond is not based on ethnicity or lineage but on spiritual rebirth and adoption into God's family (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>).<p><b>So Jesus is not ashamed</b><br>This indicates Christ's willingness to associate with believers despite their imperfections. In the cultural context of the first century, honor and shame were significant social values. By stating that Jesus is not ashamed, it underscores His acceptance and love for believers, regardless of their past or status. This reflects the grace and mercy inherent in the gospel message (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<p><b>to call them brothers.</b><br>Calling believers "brothers" signifies a deep, personal relationship. In Jewish culture, the term "brother" was used not only for biological siblings but also for close kin and community members. This term signifies equality and shared inheritance among believers and Christ (<a href="/hebrews/2-17.htm">Hebrews 2:17</a>). It fulfills the prophecy and typology of the Old Testament, where the Messiah would be a brother to His people (<a href="/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>). This brotherhood is a testament to the new covenant established through Christ's sacrifice, uniting all believers as one family under God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The one who sanctifies believers, making them holy and setting them apart for God's purposes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those who are sanctified by Jesus, becoming part of God's family.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/family_of_god.htm">Family of God</a></b><br>The spiritual family that includes Jesus and all believers, emphasizing unity and shared identity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctification.htm">Sanctification</a></b><br>The process of being made holy, which is initiated and completed by Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/brotherhood.htm">Brotherhood</a></b><br>The relationship between Jesus and believers, highlighting the intimate and familial bond.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_christ.htm">Unity in Christ</a></b><br>As believers, we are united with Christ and each other, forming one family.

The idea expressed here by the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, to sanctify, may be determined by comparison with <a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13, 14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14, 29</a>; and Hebrews 13:12 (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); cf. <a href="/john/17-9.htm">John 17:9</a>. It is not the idea, to us most familiar, of moral sanctification through the Holy Spirit, but that of the redeemed being brought into a new relation to God, hallowed for "<span class="accented">glory</span>," through redemption; whence all Christians are called <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is the equivalent in the LXX. of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span>, which is applied to the hallowing of both the sacrifices and the people to God's service. As an atoning sacrifice, Christ thus hallowed himself (<a href="/john/17-19.htm">John 17:19</a>), that thus he might hallow the "many sons." <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> must certainly be taken as referring to God, not (as some take it) to Abraham or Adam. For the necessity of the SON taking part of <span class="accented">flesh and blood</span> in order to accomplish the redemption is not introduced till ver. 14. So far the common fatherhood spoken of has been that of him "for whom are all things and by whom are all things," who, "in bringing many <span class="accented">sons</span> to glory," has perfected "the Captain of their salvation." The idea is that it was meet that the Captain should be perfected through human sufferings, <span class="accented">since</span> both he and the "many sons" are of one Divine Father; in their relation of sonship (with whatever difference of manner and degree) they are associated together. Be it observed, however, that it is not the <span class="accented">original</span> relation to God of the "Sanctifier" and the "sanctified," but their relation to him in the redemption, that is denoted by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The common sonship does not consist in this, that <span class="accented">he</span> is Son by eternal generation and <span class="accented">they</span> by creation. It has been seen above that the term <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f35;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is net applied to Christ in this Epistle with reference to his eternal Being, but to his incarnation; and the human "sons" are not regarded as such till made so by redemption. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> rule the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The view is that the one Father sent the SON into the world to be the Firstborn of many sons. The expression, frequent in the Pentateuch, "I am he that sanctifieth," may be cited in illustration of the moaning of the passage. <span class="cmt_word">For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the Messianic utterances of the Old Testament, to which, in accordance with the plan and purpose of the Epistle, reference is again made for proof. The point of the quotations that follow (vers. 12, 13) is that the Messiah, notwithstanding the position above the angels, shown above to be assigned to him, is represented also as associating himself with men as brethren, in dependence on one heavenly Father. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/2-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
