The reference to being "a little lower than the angels" highlights the humility and condescension of Christ, who took on human form. This is rooted in <a href="/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5</a>, which speaks of mankind's place in creation, but in Hebrews, it is applied to Jesus, showing His identification with humanity. Theologically, this underscores the mystery of the Incarnation, where Jesus, though fully divine, became fully human to fulfill His redemptive work. The phrase also points to the order of creation, where angels are spiritual beings with a higher status than humans in terms of power and presence in the heavenly realm. However, Jesus' temporary lower status was necessary for His mission of salvation.<p><b>You crowned him with glory and honor</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the exaltation of Christ following His resurrection and ascension. After completing His work on earth, Jesus was glorified and honored by God the Father, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where God highly exalts Him and gives Him the name above every name. The crowning with glory and honor signifies His victory over sin and death and His rightful place at the right hand of God. This also fulfills the messianic prophecies found in the Old Testament, where the Messiah is depicted as a reigning king. The imagery of a crown is significant in biblical culture, symbolizing authority, victory, and divine approval. This exaltation assures believers of Christ's sovereignty and His role as the mediator between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who is made "a little lower than the angels" during His incarnation, yet crowned with glory and honor through His resurrection and ascension.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Spiritual beings who serve God and are often seen as messengers.

Here the LXX. takes <span class="accented">Elohim</span> (being a plural form) to mean "angels;" as also in <a href="/psalms/97-7.htm">Psalm 97:7</a> and Psalms 138:1. The more correct rendering of the Hebrew may be, "thou reddest him a little short of God," with reference to his having been made "in God's image," "after God's likeness," and having dominion over creation given him. But, if so, <span class="accented">Elohim</span> must be understood in its abstract sense of "Divinity" (so Genesis), rather than as denoting the Supreme Being. Otherwise, "thyself" would have been the more appropriate expression, the psalm being addressed to God. The argument is not affected by the difference of translation. Indeed, the latter rendering enhances still more the position assigned to man. <span class="cmt_word">Thou crownedst him with glory and worship, and didst set him over the works of thy hands</span>. The latter clause of this sentence, which is found in the LXX., but not in the Hebrew, is omitted in several codices. It is not wanted for the purpose of the argument. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You made him a little lower</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7968;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#964;&#969;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;latt&#333;sas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1642.htm">Strong's 1642: </a> </span><span class="str2">To make less (inferior).
