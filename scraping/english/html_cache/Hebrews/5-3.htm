The high priest had a divinely appointed role, as outlined in Leviticus, to mediate between God and the people. This obligation was not optional but a requirement of his office, emphasizing the seriousness and responsibility of his position. The high priest's role was to ensure that the sacrificial system was maintained, which was central to the Israelites' relationship with God.<p><b>to offer sacrifices for his own sins</b><br>The high priest, being human, was also a sinner and needed to offer sacrifices for his own sins before he could intercede for the people. This requirement is detailed in <a href="/leviticus/16-6.htm">Leviticus 16:6</a>, where Aaron, the first high priest, is instructed to make atonement for himself and his household. This highlights the imperfection of the Levitical priesthood and foreshadows the need for a perfect high priest, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is sinless and does not need to offer sacrifices for Himself.<p><b>as well as for the sins of the people</b><br>The high priest's role extended beyond personal atonement to include the sins of the entire nation. This communal aspect of the sacrificial system is seen in the Day of Atonement rituals (<a href="/leviticus/16-15.htm">Leviticus 16:15-16</a>), where the high priest made atonement for the people of Israel. This practice underscores the collective nature of sin and the need for a mediator. In the New Testament, Jesus is presented as the ultimate high priest who offers Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all people, fulfilling and surpassing the Old Testament sacrificial system.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest.htm">High Priest</a></b><br>In the context of <a href="/bsb/hebrews/5.htm">Hebrews 5</a>, the high priest is a central figure who mediates between God and the people.

The phrase &#8220;That is why&#8221; points back to two truths just stated:<p>&#8226; The high priest is chosen &#8220;from among men&#8221; (v. 1), meaning he shares human weakness.<p>&#8226; He &#8220;can deal gently with those who are ignorant and misguided, since he himself is beset by weakness&#8221; (v. 2).<p>Because the priest shares fallen humanity, a sacrificial response is necessary. <a href="/leviticus/16-6.htm">Leviticus 16:6</a> demonstrates this principle when Aaron first offers a bull for his own atonement before ministering for Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he is obligated</b><p>The verb underscores duty, not option. God&#8217;s law required a priest to follow an established pattern (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3&#8211;12</a>; 9:7). No priest could improvise or bypass what God commanded. This obligation reminds us that forgiveness never comes through human merit but through God-ordained sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to offer sacrifices</b><p>Sacrifice stands at the heart of priestly ministry:<p>&#8226; Blood covers guilt (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Sacrifice enables continued fellowship between God and His people (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-46</a>).<p>&#8226; It foreshadows the once-for-all offering of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-4, 12</a>).<p>The plurality &#8220;sacrifices&#8221; reflects the many offerings demanded under the old covenant&#8212;daily, weekly, annually&#8212;highlighting its incompleteness compared with the single perfect sacrifice of Jesus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for his own sins</b><p>Human priests shared the same sin nature as those they represented (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). Before approaching God on behalf of others, a priest needed cleansing himself (<a href="/leviticus/16-6.htm">Leviticus 16:6, 11</a>). This emphasized:<p>&#8226; Personal accountability&#8212;no one stands exempt.<p>&#8226; The inadequacy of any merely human mediator.<p>&#8226; The contrast with Christ, the sinless High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-27</a>), who never needed to atone for Himself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as well as</b><p>The connector links two inseparable tasks. Once purified, the priest&#8217;s service expands outward. <a href="/leviticus/16-15.htm">Leviticus 16:15</a> shows Aaron moving from his own offering to the people&#8217;s, illustrating the flow: cleanse the mediator, then cleanse the nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the sins of the people</b><p>The priest acts representatively, carrying Israel&#8217;s guilt before God (<a href="/exodus/28-29.htm">Exodus 28:29-30</a>). Key truths emerge:<p>&#8226; Sin separates the people from God (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p>&#8226; God, in mercy, provides a substitutionary system so He can dwell among them (<a href="/numbers/28-1.htm">Numbers 28:1-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The priests&#8217; continual offerings foreshadow Christ, who &#8220;entered the Most Holy Place once for all&#8230; having obtained eternal redemption&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/5-3.htm">Hebrews 5:3</a> teaches that every earthly high priest, sharing humanity&#8217;s weakness, must first deal with his own sin through God-appointed sacrifices before interceding for others. This requirement exposes the limitations of the Levitical system and prepares us to see the superiority of Jesus, the sinless and eternal High Priest whose single sacrifice perfectly satisfies God for both priest and people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) To be closely joined with <a href="/hebrews/5-2.htm" title="Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.">Hebrews 5:2</a> : "Is compassed with infirmity, and by reason thereof is bound . . ." The law of the Day of Atonement required a sin-offering of a bullock and a burnt-offering of a ram for the high priest himself, and for the congregation a sin-offering of two he-goats and a burnt-offering of a ram. Over his own sin-offering the high priest made confession of sins, first for himself and his household, then for the priests; over the goat sent into the wilderness the sins of the people were confessed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And by reason hereof he ought</span> (or, is <span class="accented">bound</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</span> This obligation is evident in the case of the high priests of the Law. Consequently, their sin offering for themselves, in the first place, was a prominent part of the ceremonial of the Day of Atonement, which the writer may be supposed to have especially in view (<a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>.). But can we suppose any corresponding necessity in the case of Christ? The argument does not absolutely require that we should, since the obligation of the Levitical high priest may be adduced only in proof of his own experience of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. Christ, though under no such obligation, might still fulfill the requisites of a high priest, expressed in the case of sinful high priests by the obligation to offer for themselves; and we may (as Ebrard says) leave it to the writer to show hew he does fulfill them. Whether, however, there was in Christ's own experience anything corresponding to the high priest's offering for himself will be considered under vers. 7, 8. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/5-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">That is why</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he is obligated</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8000;&#966;&#949;&#943;&#955;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(opheilei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3784.htm">Strong's 3784: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or, its prolonged form opheileo probably from the base of ophelos; to owe; figuratively, to be under obligation; morally, to fail in duty.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to offer sacrifices</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#966;&#941;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(prospherein)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4374.htm">Strong's 4374: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pros and phero; to bear towards, i.e. Lead to, tender, treat.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(peri)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4012.htm">Strong's 4012: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of peran; properly, through, i.e. Around; figuratively with respect to; used in various applications, of place, cause or time.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his own</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8017;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(hautou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
