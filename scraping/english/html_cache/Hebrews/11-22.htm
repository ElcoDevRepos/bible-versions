Despite the trials he faced, including being sold into slavery and unjust imprisonment, Joseph maintained his trust in God. His faith is a testament to his belief in God's promises, which were passed down from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Joseph's life is a type of Christ, as he was a savior to his family and the nation of Egypt during a time of famine.<p><b>when his end was near</b><br>Joseph's awareness of his impending death reflects the biblical theme of mortality and the importance of preparing for one's end. This phrase indicates Joseph's foresight and understanding of God's plan, even as his life was drawing to a close. It also underscores the importance of faithfulness until the end, a recurring theme in Scripture.<p><b>spoke about the exodus of the Israelites</b><br>Joseph's mention of the exodus demonstrates his belief in God's covenant with Abraham, which included the promise of the land of Canaan. This prophecy, found in <a href="/genesis/50-24.htm">Genesis 50:24</a>, shows Joseph's confidence in God's future deliverance of Israel from Egypt. It connects to the larger biblical narrative of redemption and deliverance, foreshadowing the eventual exodus led by Moses.<p><b>and gave instructions about his bones</b><br>Joseph's instructions regarding his bones, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/50-25.htm">Genesis 50:25</a>, signify his desire to be associated with the Promised Land, even in death. This act of faith is a powerful symbol of hope and trust in God's promises. It also prefigures the resurrection, as Joseph's bones were eventually carried to Canaan during the exodus, fulfilling his request and symbolizing the future hope of resurrection for all believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The eleventh son of Jacob, known for his rise to power in Egypt and his role in saving his family during a famine.
