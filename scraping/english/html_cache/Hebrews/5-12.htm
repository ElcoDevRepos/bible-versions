This implies that they have been believers for a significant period, long enough to have developed a deeper understanding of their faith. The early church placed a strong emphasis on discipleship and teaching, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His followers to teach others. The expectation here is that believers should progress from learners to teachers, reflecting the growth seen in the early Christian communities.<p><b>you need someone to reteach you the basic principles of God&#8217;s word</b><br>The "basic principles" refer to foundational teachings of the Christian faith, possibly including doctrines such as repentance, faith, baptism, and resurrection, as outlined in <a href="/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6:1-2</a>. The need for reteaching suggests a regression or stagnation in spiritual growth, which was a concern in the early church. This mirrors the situation in <a href="/1_corinthians/3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1-2</a>, where Paul addresses the Corinthians' spiritual immaturity. The call to return to foundational teachings highlights the importance of a solid grounding in Scripture for spiritual maturity.<p><b>You need milk, not solid food!</b><br>The metaphor of milk versus solid food illustrates the difference between elementary teachings and deeper, more complex doctrines. Milk represents the basic teachings suitable for new believers, while solid food symbolizes advanced instruction for mature Christians. This imagery is also used by Paul in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-2.htm">1 Corinthians 3:2</a>, emphasizing the need for believers to grow beyond the basics. The call to move from milk to solid food reflects the natural progression expected in a believer's spiritual journey, akin to a child's growth from infancy to adulthood. This growth is essential for understanding the deeper mysteries of faith and for fulfilling the role of a teacher within the Christian community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is uncertain.

After hearing the gospel, experiencing salvation, and sitting under sound instruction, believers are expected to move from learners to disciple-makers (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<p>- Teaching is not reserved for an elite few; it is the natural outflow of spiritual growth. As the Spirit illuminates truth, we share it with the next person in line (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-13</a>).<p>- This verse confronts spiritual stagnation: &#8220;We have much to say&#8230; but it is hard to explain, because you are dull of hearing&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11</a>). A dulled ear keeps a believer from becoming the teacher God intends.<p>- While <a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a> reminds us that teachers incur stricter judgment, the writer of Hebrews still insists we reach the point where we can handle that responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You need someone to reteach you the basic principles of God&#8217;s word</b><p>- The &#8220;basic principles&#8221; (literally &#8220;elementary truths&#8221;) include repentance, faith, baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection, and eternal judgment&#8212;topics the author will name in <a href="/hebrews/6-1.htm">Hebrews 6:1-2</a>.<p>- Instead of pressing forward, these believers need the ABCs repeated. Paul warned the Galatians about reverting to &#8220;weak and worthless principles&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>).<p>- Reteaching basics is necessary for newborn believers; it is a sign of arrested development when required by long-time Christians. Peter&#8217;s call to &#8220;crave pure spiritual milk&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>) is a beginning point, not a lifelong plateau.<p>- <a href="/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6-7</a> urges us to be &#8220;rooted and built up in Him.&#8221; Roots are unseen but essential; yet trees are expected to grow above the ground as well.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You need milk, not solid food!</b><p>- Milk represents foundational doctrine: salvation by grace, assurance, simple obedience. Solid food covers richer themes like Christ&#8217;s high-priestly ministry (<a href="/hebrews/5-10.htm">Hebrews 5:10</a>), God&#8217;s sovereign purposes, and discerning good from evil (<a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>).<p>- Paul gave the same rebuke to Corinth: &#8220;I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-2.htm">1 Corinthians 3:2</a>).<p>- Spiritual infancy is acceptable when one is newly born; it is tragic when it persists. &#8220;Brothers, stop thinking like children&#8230; be mature&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>).<p>- <a href="/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9-10</a> pictures God teaching &#8220;order on order, line on line.&#8221; The lesson advances only when the pupil is ready; otherwise, He repeats the basics.<p>- Signs you are ready for solid food:<p>- Ears trained to listen (<a href="/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11</a>).<p>- Senses trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil (<a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>).<p>- A desire not merely to receive but to serve (<a href="/john/13-17.htm">John 13:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a> confronts believers who should be teaching but still need to be taught. Scripture expects growth: time plus truth should equal maturity. If we find ourselves repeatedly circling the elementary truths, we must admit the problem, rekindle our appetite for God&#8217;s Word, put into practice what we already know, and step forward to disciple others. Solid food awaits every believer who is willing to move beyond milk and pursue full-grown Christlikeness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hebrews/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">For the time.</span>--Taking into account the time that had elapsed since they became Christians.<p><span class= "bld">Ye have need.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">ye have need that some</span> <span class= "ital">one teach you again the rudiments of the beginning of</span> <span class= "ital">the oracles of God</span> (<a href="/acts/7-38.htm" title="This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give to us:">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="/romans/3-2.htm" title="Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.">Romans 3:2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm" title="If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God gives: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.

Here its meaning can hardly be taken as confined to them, since the first principles of the gospel are being spoken cf. Still, a word that includes them in its meaning may be purposely used by way of intimating that the elements intended are those of Judaism as well as Christianity, or of the latter only in its first emergence out of Judaism. And accordingly, vers. 1, 2 of <a href="/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6</a>, where they are enumerated, are (as will be seen) so worded as to imply no more than this; nor are the first principles there mentioned beyond what an enlightened Jew might be expected to understand readily. Be it observed that the Hebrew Church need not be supposed to have actually lost sight of these first principles, so as to require a new indoctrination into them. There may be a vein of delicate irony in what is said, after the manner of St. Paul. All that is of necessity implied is that there had been such a failure in seeing what these principles led to as to suggest the necessity of their being learnt anew. The writer does not, in fact, as he goes on, require them to be learnt anew; for he bids his readers leave them behind, as though already known, and proceed from them to perfection, though still with some misgiving as to their capability for doing so. The figure of milk for babes and solid food for full-grown men, to illustrate the teaching suitable for neophytes and for advanced Christians, is found also in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1, 2</a>; and that of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>. This correspondence, though no proof of the Pauline authorship, is among the evidences of the Pauline character of the Epistle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hebrews/5-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Although</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">by</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[this]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
