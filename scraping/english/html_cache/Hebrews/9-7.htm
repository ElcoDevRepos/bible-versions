On that day, according to Leviticus 16, it was the duty of the high priest to enter the Holy of Holies twice: (1) with the incense and with the blood of the bullock, his own sin-offering (<a href="/context/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:">Leviticus 16:12-14</a>); (2) with the blood of the same bullock and that of the goat, the sin-offering for the people (<a href="/context/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15-19</a>). In the ritual described in the tract "Joma" of the Talmud, he is said to enter four times; the first ministration being separated into its two parts (offering incense, sprinkling the blood of the bullock), and a fourth entering (to bring out the censer) being added.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself and for the errors</span> (literally, <span class="accented">ignorances</span>; cf. ver. 2) <span class="cmt_word">of the people.</span> For the ceremonies on the Day of Atonement, see <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>.
