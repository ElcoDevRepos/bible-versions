In biblical context, "tasting" implies a personal encounter or experience, as seen in <a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>, "Taste and see that the LORD is good." It indicates a genuine, albeit possibly incomplete, experience of spiritual realities.<p><b>the goodness of the word of God</b><br>The "word of God" refers to the divine revelation found in Scripture. The "goodness" highlights the beneficial and life-giving nature of God's word, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/119-103.htm">Psalm 119:103</a>, "How sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!" This phrase underscores the transformative power of Scripture in the believer's life.<p><b>and the powers of the coming age&#8212;</b><br>This refers to the miraculous works and spiritual gifts that are a foretaste of the future kingdom of God. The "coming age" is a reference to the eschatological future, the time when God's kingdom will be fully realized. This is connected to the "already but not yet" tension in Christian theology, where believers experience aspects of the kingdom now, but await its full consummation. This is seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>, where believers have the "firstfruits of the Spirit" as a guarantee of what is to come.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/recipients_of_the_letter_to_the_hebrews.htm">Recipients of the Letter to the Hebrews</a></b><br>The original audience of the letter, likely Jewish Christians who were familiar with the Old Testament and were facing persecution or temptation to revert to Judaism.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>While the author is not explicitly named, the letter is traditionally attributed to Paul or another early Christian leader who had a deep understanding of Jewish traditions and the new covenant in Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_coming_age.htm">The Coming Age</a></b><br>Refers to the eschatological future, the time when God's kingdom will be fully realized, and His power will be fully manifested.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_god.htm">The Word of God</a></b><br>In this context, it refers to the message of the Gospel and the teachings of Christ, which are seen as the ultimate revelation of God's will.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_powers.htm">The Powers</a></b><br>This likely refers to the miraculous works and spiritual gifts that were evident in the early church, serving as a foretaste of the full power of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/experiencing_god's_goodness.htm">Experiencing God's Goodness</a></b><br>Believers are called to not only know about God intellectually but to experience His goodness personally through His word and Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/foretaste_of_the_kingdom.htm">Foretaste of the Kingdom</a></b><br>The spiritual experiences and gifts we encounter now are a foretaste of the full reality of God's kingdom, encouraging us to live with hope and anticipation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_of_revelation.htm">Responsibility of Revelation</a></b><br>With the privilege of tasting God's goodness comes the responsibility to live faithfully and not fall away, as warned in the surrounding context of <a href="/bsb/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6</a>.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_maturity.htm">Spiritual Maturity</a></b><br>The passage challenges believers to move beyond elementary teachings and grow into maturity, fully embracing the depth of God's word and power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_faith.htm">Perseverance in Faith</a></b><br>Understanding the powers of the coming age should motivate believers to persevere in their faith, even amidst trials and temptations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hebrews_6_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hebrews 6:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_6_5_on_tasting_God_s_word.htm">How does Hebrews 6:5 describe the experience of tasting "the goodness of God&#8217;s word"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_powers_of_the_coming_age.htm">What does "powers of the coming age" mean in Hebrews 6:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_God_s_word_daily_how.htm">How can we apply the "goodness of God&#8217;s word" in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Which_texts_stress_God_s_word_and_power.htm">What other scriptures emphasize experiencing God's word and power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_believers_access_future_powers.htm">How can believers today experience the "powers of the coming age"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_tasted_God_s_word_in_Heb_6_5.htm">What does "tasted the goodness of the word of God" mean in Hebrews 6:5?
