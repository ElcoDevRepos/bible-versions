Her faith is significant because it highlights the role of women in the biblical narrative and God's plan. Despite initial doubt, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a> when she laughed at the promise of bearing a child, Sarah ultimately believed in God's promise. Her faith is a testament to the transformative power of trust in God, even when circumstances seem impossible.<p><b>even though she was barren and beyond the proper age</b><br>Sarah's barrenness is a recurring theme in Genesis, emphasizing the miraculous nature of Isaac's birth. In ancient Near Eastern culture, barrenness was often seen as a source of shame and a sign of divine disfavor. Sarah was well beyond childbearing years, as <a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a> notes that she was 90 years old when she was promised a son. This underscores the miraculous intervention of God, who often works through human weakness to demonstrate His power and faithfulness.<p><b>was enabled to conceive a child</b><br>The conception of Isaac was a direct result of divine intervention. This miraculous event is a foreshadowing of other miraculous births in the Bible, most notably the virgin birth of Jesus Christ. It highlights God's sovereignty over nature and His ability to fulfill His promises against all odds. The birth of Isaac is a pivotal moment in the Abrahamic covenant, as it ensures the continuation of the lineage through which the Messiah would eventually come.<p><b>because she considered Him faithful who had promised</b><br>Sarah's faith was rooted in her belief in God's faithfulness. The promise referred to is found in <a href="/genesis/17-16.htm">Genesis 17:16</a>, where God promises Abraham that Sarah will bear a son. This phrase emphasizes the importance of trusting in God's character and His promises. It connects to other scriptural affirmations of God's faithfulness, such as <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>.

One such peculiar trial was the long delay of the birth of a legitimate heir through whom the promise of an innumerable seed might be fulfilled, and this till it seemed out of the question in the natural course of things. Yet "he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief... being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform" (see <a href="/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17-23</a>, which is a fuller statement of the idea of this verse, including the use of the words <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> to express effeteness, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, corresponding to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span> here. This is a further instance of Pauline thought in this Epistle - ideas already enlarged on by St. Paul being taken for granted as understood.) In Romans Abraham's faith in this regard is treated as typifying Christian faith in the resurrection from the dead (ver. 24), as is also, in the chapter before us (ver. 19), his faith displayed on the occasion of the offering of Isaac. For to us also our inability to conceive the mode of accomplishment of what well-grounded faith assures us of is no just cause for staggering. "How are the dead raised up? and with what kind of body do they come?" was asked by the Corinthian doubters. St. Paul directs them, in reply, to faith in "the power of God" (cf. <a href="/mark/12-24.htm">Mark 12:24</a>) to accomplish his purposes and fulfill his promises in ways unknown to us, transcending, though analogous to, the mysterious processes of nature that we see before our eyes. For "with God all things are possible." Sarah is here joined with Abraham, as also "receiving power" by faith, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> her own faith, as the structure of ver. 11 seems evidently to imply. But how is this consistent with the account of her in Genesis, where she is nowhere held up as an example of faith; nay, is censured for incredulity (<a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12-16</a>) with respect to the promise cf. offspring? The answer may be that her temporary unbelief is concluded to have been succeeded by faith, as proved by the result, viz. that she "<span class="accented">received</span> power." And, indeed, her laughter recorded in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, does not seem intended to imply any permanent "heart of unbelief;" for even Abraham had laughed as she did when the same announcement had been previously made to him (<a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>), and the "<span class="accented">laughter"</span> associated with her memory has quite a different meaning given it when that of temporary incredulity was changed into that of joy on the birth of the promised son, who was consequently called Isaac (equivalent to "laughter"). It <span class="accented">is</span>, however, Abraham himself who is put prominently before us as the great example of faith; Sarah is only introduced by his side (with the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;</span>) as sharing it and cooperating to the result.
