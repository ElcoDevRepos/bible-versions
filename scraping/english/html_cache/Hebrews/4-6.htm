The "rest" here is both a present spiritual reality and a future promise, symbolizing salvation and eternal life. The idea of rest is also linked to the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land, which was a type of the ultimate rest believers find in Christ. The use of "remains" indicates that the promise of entering God's rest is still open, emphasizing God's enduring grace and the opportunity for salvation.<p><b>and since those who formerly heard the good news did not enter because of their disobedience,</b><br>This part references the Israelites who, despite hearing God's promises, failed to enter the Promised Land due to unbelief and disobedience (<a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22-23</a>). The "good news" they heard was the promise of entering a land flowing with milk and honey, which parallels the gospel message of salvation through Christ. Their failure serves as a warning and a lesson for contemporary believers about the consequences of unbelief and disobedience. This historical context underscores the importance of faith and obedience in the Christian life, as echoed in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7-11</a>, which is also cited earlier in <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The original recipients of God's promise of rest, who failed to enter due to disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>A symbol of God's rest, initially promised to the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_author_of_hebrews.htm">The Author of Hebrews</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Paul, though the exact authorship is debated.

These five particulars are repeated in substance in the present verse: "Seeing, therefore, it is (still) left that some should enter in, and they to whom formerly glad tidings were declared entered not in because of disobedience, He again," &c.
