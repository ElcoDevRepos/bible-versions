However, it was never intended to bring about spiritual perfection or complete reconciliation with God. The law served as a tutor to lead us to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>), highlighting humanity's inability to achieve righteousness through works. The sacrificial system, central to the law, pointed to the need for a perfect sacrifice, which was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The law's inability to perfect is echoed in <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, where it states that what the law could not do, God did by sending His own Son.<p><b>and a better hope is introduced</b><br>This better hope refers to the new covenant established through Jesus Christ. Unlike the old covenant, which was based on adherence to the law, the new covenant offers a direct relationship with God through faith in Jesus. This hope is better because it is based on the finished work of Christ, who is both the high priest and the perfect sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>). The introduction of this hope fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises a new covenant written on the hearts of His people.<p><b>by which we draw near to God</b><br>Under the old covenant, access to God was limited, with the high priest entering the Holy of Holies only once a year. In contrast, the new covenant allows believers to draw near to God with confidence (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>). This nearness is made possible through Jesus, our mediator, who has opened the way to the Father (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The concept of drawing near to God is central to the Christian faith, emphasizing a personal and intimate relationship with the Creator, made possible through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law given to the Israelites, which includes commandments, rituals, and regulations intended to guide the people in their relationship with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The introduction of a "better hope" is through Jesus, who is the fulfillment of the law and the mediator of a new covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/melchizedek.htm">Melchizedek</a></b><br>Mentioned earlier in <a href="/bsb/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>, Melchizedek is a priestly figure whose order is eternal and superior to the Levitical priesthood, symbolizing the new priesthood of Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levitical_priesthood.htm">The Levitical Priesthood</a></b><br>The priesthood established under the Mosaic Law, which was responsible for offering sacrifices and mediating between God and the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_covenant.htm">The New Covenant</a></b><br>The new relationship between God and humanity established through Jesus Christ, offering a direct and personal connection to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limitation_of_the_law.htm">The Limitation of the Law</a></b><br>The Mosaic Law was unable to bring about perfection or complete reconciliation with God.
