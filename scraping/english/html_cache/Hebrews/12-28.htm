The "unshakable kingdom" refers to the eternal reign of God, which is a central theme throughout Scripture, including prophecies in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a> and the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>. The concept of an unshakable kingdom would resonate with early Christians facing persecution, offering them hope and assurance of God's ultimate sovereignty and victory.<p><b>let us be filled with gratitude</b><br>Gratitude is a recurring theme in the New Testament, reflecting a heart transformed by the grace of God. In <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>, believers are encouraged to give thanks in all circumstances, highlighting gratitude as a fundamental response to God's goodness and provision. This gratitude is not just an emotional response but a recognition of the grace and mercy received through Christ, which should permeate every aspect of a believer's life.<p><b>and so worship God acceptably</b><br>Worship in the biblical context involves both attitude and action. Acceptable worship is characterized by sincerity, truth, and alignment with God's will, as seen in <a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>, where Jesus speaks of worshiping in spirit and truth. The Old Testament also provides examples of acceptable and unacceptable worship, such as Cain and Abel's offerings in <a href="/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4</a>. This phrase calls believers to examine their hearts and ensure their worship aligns with God's standards, not merely external rituals.<p><b>with reverence and awe</b><br>Reverence and awe are responses to the holiness and majesty of God. Throughout Scripture, encounters with God often evoke fear and reverence, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>. These responses acknowledge God's transcendence and the believer's humility before Him. The call to worship with reverence and awe serves as a reminder of God's greatness and the appropriate posture of humility and respect in His presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_recipients_of_hebrews.htm">The Recipients of Hebrews</a></b><br>The letter is addressed to Jewish Christians who were familiar with the Old Testament and were facing persecution, encouraging them to remain steadfast in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>Refers to the spiritual reign of God, which is unshakable and eternal, contrasting with earthly kingdoms that are temporary and unstable.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/worship.htm">Worship</a></b><br>The act of revering and honoring God, which in this context is to be done with gratitude, reverence, and awe.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_zion.htm">Mount Zion</a></b><br>Earlier in <a href="/bsb/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12</a>, Mount Zion is mentioned as a symbol of the heavenly Jerusalem, representing the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_old_covenant_vs._the_new_covenant.htm">The Old Covenant vs. The New Covenant</a></b><br>The letter contrasts the old covenant, given at Mount Sinai, with the new covenant, which is established through Jesus Christ and is unshakable.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_as_a_response_to_god's_kingdom.htm">Gratitude as a Response to God's Kingdom</a></b><br>Recognize that receiving an unshakable kingdom should fill us with gratitude.
