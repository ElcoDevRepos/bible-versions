This promise is found in <a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>, where God assures Abraham that his descendants will be named through Isaac. The context here is the test of faith in <a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>, where God commands Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, his only son with Sarah, through whom the promise was to be fulfilled. This situation underscores the theme of faith and obedience, as Abraham trusts God's promise despite the apparent contradiction.<p><b>&#8220;Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.&#8221;</b><br>This statement is a direct reference to the covenantal promise God made to Abraham. The word "reckoned" implies a legal or formal recognition of lineage, emphasizing the legitimacy and divine approval of Isaac as the heir. This promise is foundational to the Abrahamic covenant, which is central to the narrative of the Old Testament and the unfolding plan of redemption. It connects to the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His promises, as seen in the fulfillment through the nation of Israel and ultimately in Jesus Christ, a descendant of Isaac. Theologically, this phrase points to the concept of faith in God's promises, even when circumstances seem to contradict them, as seen in <a href="/romans/9-7.htm">Romans 9:7-8</a>, where Paul discusses the spiritual lineage of Abraham's descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.
