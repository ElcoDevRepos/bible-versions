This confidence is rooted in the understanding that God is faithful (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>) and that He who began a good work in them will carry it on to completion (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>). The emphasis on "in the Lord" underscores the belief that all spiritual growth and obedience are ultimately enabled by God's grace and strength, not by human effort alone.<p><b>that you are doing</b><br>Paul acknowledges the current obedience and faithfulness of the Thessalonian church. This recognition serves as an encouragement, affirming their present actions and reinforcing their commitment to living according to the teachings they have received. The Thessalonians had already demonstrated their faith through perseverance amidst persecution (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6-7</a>), and Paul commends them for their ongoing faithfulness.<p><b>and will continue to do</b><br>This phrase expresses Paul's expectation of their future obedience. It suggests a continuity of faith and action, emphasizing the importance of perseverance in the Christian life. The future aspect of this statement aligns with the biblical theme of enduring faith, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1-2</a>, where believers are encouraged to run with perseverance the race marked out for them. It also reflects the eschatological hope that believers will remain steadfast until the return of Christ.<p><b>what we command</b><br>Paul's use of "command" indicates the authoritative nature of his instructions, which are not merely suggestions but directives grounded in apostolic authority. This authority is derived from his role as an apostle of Christ, tasked with establishing and guiding the early church (<a href="/1_corinthians/4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>). The commands likely refer to the teachings and instructions given in both letters to the Thessalonians, including living a life pleasing to God, working diligently, and maintaining hope in the return of Christ (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1-12</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6-12</a>).

St. Chrysostom's whole comment is worth transcription:--"God, saith he, is faithful, and having promised to save, save He assuredly will, but <span class= "ital">as</span> He promised. And how did He promise? If we would be agreeable, and would hear Him; not unconditionally, nor while we remain inactive like stocks and stones. Yet, well has he added his, 'We rely <span class= "ital">in the Lord</span>:' that is, 'We trust to His love of men.' Once more he takes them down, ascribing the whole matter to that quarter; for had he said 'We trust to you,' it would have been a great compliment indeed, but would not have taught them to ascribe all to God; and had he said 'We rely on the Lord that He will keep you,' without adding 'upon you,' and 'that ye both do and will do what things we command,' he would have made them less active by casting the whole upon the power of God." (See the passage of Galatians referred to in the margin.)<p><span class= "bld">Both do and will do.</span>--The emphasis of the sentence is on the future tense, the commendation of the present being only intended to do away the rebuke which might have been conveyed by the future alone. How careful St. Paul is not to wound susceptibilities, though he never "pleases men"! (See, for instance, Notes on <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm" title="But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.">1Thessalonians 4:9-10</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm" title="Why comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you do.">1Thessalonians 5:11</a>.) This expression of confidence is a happy rhetorical means of preparing readers for the commands which are to follow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And we have confidence in the Lord.</span> The apostle confidently expects the obedience of the Thessalonians, but his confidence is not fixed on them - on their own efforts, endeavours, and resolutions - but on the Lord, namely, Christ; on his grace and strength communicated to and perfected in weakness. The obedience of the Thessalonians flowed from the grace of Christ; it was in consequence of the communication of the influences of his Spirit that they were enabled to make progress and to persevere in the Christian life. "Here," observes Professor Jowett, "as elsewhere, the apostle speaks of believing, hoping, doing all things in Christ. We lead an ordinary life as well as a religious one; but, with the apostle, his ordinary life is his religious one, and hence he uses religious expressions in reference to all that he says and does." The apostle lives in the sphere of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Touching you;</span> with reference to you - the direction of his confidence. <span class="cmt_word">That ye both do and will do the things which we command you.</span> There is here the same union of Divine assistance and human effort, of God's working and man's working, which pervades the whole scheme of the gospel salvation (see <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/3-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we have confidence</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#960;&#959;&#943;&#952;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(pepoithamen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3982.htm">Strong's 3982: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; to convince; by analogy, to pacify or conciliate; reflexively or passively, to assent, to rely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
