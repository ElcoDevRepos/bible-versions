Paul often uses "finally" to signal a summary or final exhortation (see <a href="/philippians/3.htm">Philippians 3:1</a>). The term "brothers" reflects the familial bond among believers, emphasizing unity and mutual care within the Christian community. This familial language is consistent with Paul's other letters, where he frequently addresses believers as "brothers" (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>).<p><b>pray for us,</b><br>Paul frequently requests prayer from the churches he writes to, highlighting the importance of intercessory prayer in the early church (<a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18-20</a>, <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>). This request underscores the belief in the power of prayer to support and sustain ministry efforts. It also reflects the humility of Paul, acknowledging his dependence on God's strength and the support of fellow believers.<p><b>that the word of the Lord may spread quickly</b><br>The "word of the Lord" refers to the gospel message. The desire for it to "spread quickly" suggests urgency in the mission of evangelism. This reflects the early church's commitment to the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The rapid spread of the gospel is a theme in Acts, where the message spreads despite persecution (<a href="/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7, 12</a>:24).<p><b>and be held in honor,</b><br>For the word to be "held in honor" means it should be respected and accepted as truth. This reflects the cultural context where honor and shame were significant societal values. The gospel's acceptance would bring honor to God and validate the message of the apostles. This aligns with the call for believers to live lives that honor God and reflect His truth (<a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>).<p><b>just as it was with you.</b><br>Paul commends the Thessalonians for their reception of the gospel, which was marked by faith and transformation (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6-8</a>). Their example serves as a model for other communities. This phrase also reinforces the idea of continuity and consistency in the spread of the gospel, as the same message that transformed the Thessalonians is intended to impact others similarly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who authored the letter to the Thessalonians, seeking prayer support for his ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonian_church.htm">Thessalonian Church</a></b><br>- The recipients of the letter, a community of believers in Thessalonica who had previously received the Gospel with honor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_the_lord.htm">The Word of the Lord</a></b><br>- Refers to the Gospel message that Paul desires to spread rapidly and be honored.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/brothers.htm">Brothers</a></b><br>- Fellow believers in Christ, indicating the close relationship and shared mission among Christians.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>- The act of communicating with God, which Paul requests from the Thessalonians to support his mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer_in_ministry.htm">The Power of Prayer in Ministry</a></b><br>Prayer is essential for the success and spread of the Gospel.

In all these cases the request is for active help in his work of evangelising:" not that he may fall into no danger," says St. Chrysostom, "for that he was appointed unto." (Comp. <a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm" title="Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even to bonds; but the word of God is not bound.">2Timothy 2:9</a>.)

Observe the unselfishness of the apostle's request. He does not ask the Thessalonians to pray specially for himself, but for the unimpeded diffusion and success of the gospel, and for himself only in so far as that he might be freed from all hindrances in preaching the gospel - that God would be pleased to crown his labours with success.
