Paul consistently models thankfulness in his letters, highlighting the spiritual bond between believers. This gratitude is not just a personal feeling but a communal expression of joy for the work God is doing in the lives of others. It reflects the early church's practice of prayer and thanksgiving, as seen in other epistles like <a href="/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3-5</a> and <a href="/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3-4</a>.<p><b>brothers who are loved by the Lord</b><br>The term "brothers" signifies the familial relationship among believers, transcending ethnic and social boundaries. The phrase "loved by the Lord" underscores the divine initiative in salvation, echoing themes from <a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>, where God's love is the basis for His covenant with Israel. This love is unconditional and eternal, forming the foundation of the believers' identity and security in Christ.<p><b>because God chose you from the beginning</b><br>This statement reflects the doctrine of election, where God's sovereign choice is emphasized. The concept of being chosen "from the beginning" aligns with <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, which speaks of being chosen before the foundation of the world. This choice is not based on human merit but on God's grace and purpose, reinforcing the assurance of salvation for believers.<p><b>to be saved by the sanctification of the Spirit</b><br>Salvation is presented as a process involving the Holy Spirit's sanctifying work. Sanctification refers to being set apart for God's purposes, a theme prevalent in both Old and New Testaments. The Spirit's role in sanctification is crucial, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a> and <a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a>, where the Spirit empowers believers to live holy lives, transforming them into the likeness of Christ.<p><b>and by faith in the truth</b><br>Faith is the means by which believers receive and live out the truth of the Gospel. This phrase highlights the necessity of personal belief and trust in God's revealed truth, as seen in <a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>, where Jesus prays for His followers to be sanctified by the truth. The truth refers to the Gospel message, which is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). Faith in this truth is essential for the believer's ongoing relationship with God and their spiritual growth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

Gratitude is directed to God because every spiritual blessing originates with Him (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul models a heart that never grows tired of thanking God

lies highlighted earlier in the chapter (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9-10</a>), anchoring hearts to Scripture&#8217;s unchanging truth (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a> reassures believers that their salvation rests securely in God&#8217;s eternal, loving choice, activated by the Spirit&#8217;s sanctifying work and received through faith in the gospel truth. Paul&#8217;s continual thanksgiving underscores that every step&#8212;from election to final glory&#8212;magnifies God&#8217;s grace and invites believers to live confidently, loved and set apart for Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">But we are bound.</span>--This may be called a recurrence to the subject dropped at <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="We are bound to thank God always for you, brothers, as it is meet, because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other abounds;">2Thessalonians 1:3</a>. The pronoun is somewhat emphatic. It might have seemed more natural to have sharpened the contrast between the Thessalonian Christians and the unhappy people just mentioned by beginning "But you." It is, however, part of St. Paul's delicacy of sympathy to describe rather the effect upon himself and his two companions of <span class= "ital">observing</span> that contrast. He sets himself to work the contrast out.<p><span class= "bld">Beloved of the Lord.</span>--Precisely the same phrase as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God.">1Thessalonians 1:4</a>, except for the substitution of "the Lord" for "God," which shows the concurrence of the Eternal Son in His Father's predestinations. As in the former passage, the tense ("who have been loved") makes the reader think of the everlasting duration of that love (<a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm" title="The LORD has appeared of old to me, saying, Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn you.">Jeremiah 31:3</a>), and is again connected with the mystery of election.<p>"O love, who ere life's earliest dawn<p>On me thy choice hast gently laid."<p><span class= "bld">Hath . . . chosen.</span>--The Greek tense should be rendered by <span class= "ital">chose, </span>referring to the definite moment (so to speak) in the divine counsels when the choice was fixed. This moment is defined as "from the beginning," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from the eternity preceding the origin of time, called by the same name in <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.">Genesis 1:1</a>, <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>, and <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1</a>. It does not simply mean "from the outset," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from the moment of first thinking at all about you. The identical phrase is said not to occur again in St. Paul. It may be noticed that there is a striking various-reading in some of the MSS., involving the change of only one letter, which would give us (instead of "chose you from the beginning") "chose you as firstfruits." Comp. <a href="/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">James 1:18</a>; but the reading in the text is better supported. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>; this may be considered as a simple particle of transition, or as containing a contrast to these alluded to in the previous verses.

In the former Epistle he calls them "beloved of God" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>), here "of Christ;" one of the numerous indirect proofs in these Epistles of the 1)trinity of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Because God hath from the beginning.</span> Some valuable manuscripts read, "because God hath chosen you as firstfruits," and this rendering has been adopted by several eminent expositors (Jowett, Hofmann, Riggenbach); but the preponderance of authorities is in favour of the reading in our A.V. The phrase, "from the beginning, does not denote "from the beginning' of the gospel," but "from eternity." The apostle refers the salvation of the Thessalonians to the eternal election of God. <span class="cmt_word">Chosen you to salvation</span> - the final purpose of God's election. <span class="cmt_word">Through</span>; or rather, in, denoting the elements in which the salvation consisted, or, which is the same thing, the state into which they were chosen. <span class="cmt_word">Sanctification of the Spirit</span> - the Divine side - <span class="cmt_word">and belief of the truth</span> - the human side of the element in which the salvation was realized. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7977;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#275;meis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
