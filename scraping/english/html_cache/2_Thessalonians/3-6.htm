The use of "command" suggests an apostolic mandate, reflecting the authority Paul holds as an apostle. The term "brothers" emphasizes the familial relationship within the Christian community, highlighting unity and mutual responsibility. This is consistent with Paul's other letters where he often addresses believers as "brothers" to foster a sense of community and shared faith (e.g., <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>).<p><b>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</b><br>Invoking the name of Jesus Christ underscores the seriousness and divine authority behind the command. It is not merely Paul's personal opinion but a directive that carries the weight of Christ's authority. This reflects the early Christian practice of doing all things in the name of Jesus (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>), signifying alignment with His will and purpose.<p><b>to keep away from any brother</b><br>The instruction to "keep away" suggests a form of church discipline aimed at maintaining the purity and integrity of the community. This echoes the practice of separation from those who persist in sin, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>, where Paul advises not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother but lives immorally. The goal is both corrective for the individual and protective for the community.<p><b>who leads an undisciplined life</b><br>An "undisciplined life" refers to a lifestyle that lacks order and responsibility, particularly in the context of work and community obligations. In the Greco-Roman world, discipline was highly valued, and the early church adopted similar standards to reflect their commitment to Christ. This aligns with Paul's teachings in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11-12</a>, where he encourages believers to lead a quiet life and work with their hands.<p><b>that is not in keeping with the tradition you received from us.</b><br>The "tradition" refers to the teachings and practices handed down by the apostles, which were foundational for the early church. This includes doctrinal truths and ethical instructions that were to be adhered to by all believers. Paul often emphasizes the importance of holding to apostolic tradition (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-2.htm">1 Corinthians 11:2</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/1-13.htm">2 Timothy 1:13-14</a>) as a safeguard against false teachings and moral laxity.

And he arose immediately.">Acts 9:34</a>; <a href="/acts/19-13.htm" title="Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took on them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.">Acts 19:13</a><a href="/philippians/2-10.htm" title="That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;">Philippians 2:10</a>, where, as the adoration paid to Jesus Himself is the point, the phrase must mean, "mentioning the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow." From this mention of the name in performing an action, our phrase assumes, at any rate, two distinct meanings: (1) As in <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm" title=" And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.">Colossians 3:17</a>, it implies an invocation or attestation of the person named, or a recognition of his presence and interest in the matter, in which sense it has passed into the common language of Christianity, into legal formulas, &c. (2) Here, and usually, it means a claim to the <span class= "ital">authority</span> of the person named--to act officially as his representative with full powers. (See Notes on <a href="/john/14-13.htm" title="And whatever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.">John 14:13</a>; <a href="/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>.) Thus the prophets spoke "in the name of the Lord"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as His authoritative exponents (<a href="/james/5-10.htm" title="Take, my brothers, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.">James 5:10</a>); St. Paul commands (<a href="/acts/16-18.htm" title="And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.">Acts 16:18</a>), and retains a man's sins (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.">1Corinthians 4:5</a>) "in the name of the Lord"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as His official spokesman or ambassador; the priests are to administer the unction of the sick with like authority (<a href="/context/james/5-14.htm" title="Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:">James 5:14-15</a>). So here, the Thessalonians are not to think that in disobeying St. Paul's injunctions they are rebelling against a mere human authority; Christ Himself speaks to them through St. Paul's lips. Yet, commanding with all this tremendous authority, they are still but "brethren" (<a href="/matthew/23-8.htm" title="But be not you called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all you are brothers.">Matthew 23:8</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now we command you, brethren.</span> An injunction, not specially directed to the elders or office bearers, but to the members, of the Church in general (see <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> Strengthening the command, as being given in the Name and authority of the great Head of the Church; not we, but Christ himself commands you. <span class="cmt_word">That ye withdraw yourselves.</span> A nautical expression, denoting to "shorten the sails;" hence metaphorically to keep out of the way, to withdraw; that ye avoid intercourse and fellowship with; no allusion as yet to excommunication. <span class="cmt_word">From every brother</span> - follow Christian - <span class="cmt_word">that walketh disorderly;</span> literally, <span class="accented">out of the ranks</span> (see <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And not after the tradition;</span> or, <span class="accented">the instructions</span>; not the example of the apostle, which is afterwards mentioned, but the instructions which he orally delivered when at Thessalonica, and subsequently confirmed by the Epistle which he had written to them (see <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which he received of us.</span> Here the readings of manuscripts differ.
