The Thessalonian church faced significant oppression from both Jewish and Gentile communities, as seen in <a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5-9</a>. The promise of relief is not just for the Thessalonians but extends to all believers, including Paul and his companions, who also faced hardships for their faith. This assurance of relief is a common theme in Scripture, echoing Jesus' words in <a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>, where He blesses those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake. The relief mentioned here is both a present comfort and a future hope, pointing to the ultimate justice and peace that will be established at Christ's return.<p><b>This will take place when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven</b><br>The revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven is a central eschatological event in Christian theology. This phrase refers to the second coming of Christ, a future event when Jesus will return in glory and power. The imagery of Jesus being revealed from heaven aligns with other New Testament passages such as <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>, which describe His coming with visible and undeniable majesty. This revelation is not only a moment of vindication for believers but also a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man comes with the clouds of heaven. The return of Christ is a cornerstone of Christian hope, promising the establishment of God's kingdom and the final defeat of evil.<p><b>with His mighty angels</b><br>The presence of mighty angels accompanying Jesus at His return underscores the power and authority of this event. Angels are often depicted in Scripture as God's messengers and agents of His will, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a> and <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>. Their role in the second coming highlights the cosmic significance of this moment, as they participate in executing divine judgment and gathering the elect, as described in <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>. The mention of "mighty" angels emphasizes their strength and the formidable nature of the heavenly host, reinforcing the idea that Christ's return will be a display of divine power and glory. This imagery serves to assure believers of the ultimate triumph of God's purposes and the protection and vindication of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

The word "rest" here is a noun in the accusative, not a verb, as English readers might at the first glance suppose. It literally denotes relaxation, case. The meaning of the passage is that it is a righteous thing with God to recompense rest to you who are afflicted. The recompense of the persecutors - those who afflict, is affliction; the recompense of the persecuted - the afflicted, is rest (comp. <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28, 29</a>). The rest or relaxation here mentioned is that which awaits believers, not in this world, but in the next, "where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest" (<a href="/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>). "There remaineth a rest for the people of God" (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a>). The happiness of heaven on its negative side, as freedom from earthly affliction and persecution, is here stated. It is rest to the weary, freedom to the enslaved, release from sorrow, suffering, and pain, relaxation from toil, ease from noise and turmoil, the quiet haven of peace after being tossed about in the tempestuous ocean. <span class="cmt_word">With us;</span> that is, not with us believers in general, or with us the apostles, the champions of the faith, and still less with us Jews, the saints of israel; but with us, the writers of this Epistle, namely, Paul and Silas and Timothy. <span class="cmt_word">When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed</span>; or, more literally, <span class="accented">at the revelation or apocalypse of the Lord Jesus.</span> The advent of Christ is generally expressed by another word, <span class="accented">parousia</span>, denoting "presence;" here the word is <span class="accented">apocalypse</span>, bringing before us in a more vivid manner the visible manifestation of Christ. The advent of Christ is the period when he who has hitherto been concealed will be manifested as the supreme Ruler and Judge of the world. <span class="cmt_word">From heaven;</span> where now he is concealed from human view, seated at the right hand of God. <span class="cmt_word">With his mighty angels;</span> not with his host of angels, but, as it is in the margin of our Bibles, "with the angels of his power" - serving his power and proclaiming his might.
