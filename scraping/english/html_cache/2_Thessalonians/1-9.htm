The "penalty" indicates a consequence for actions, aligning with the biblical principle of sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>). "Eternal destruction" suggests a state of irreversible ruin, not annihilation but a perpetual state of separation from God. This aligns with Jesus' teachings on hell, where the worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched (<a href="/mark/9-48.htm">Mark 9:48</a>). The term "destruction" in the New Testament often refers to a loss of well-being rather than existence, indicating a state of ruin and loss of purpose.<p><b>separated from the presence of the Lord</b><br>Separation from God is the ultimate consequence of sin, as seen in the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve were expelled (<a href="/genesis/3-23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>). The presence of the Lord is synonymous with life, blessing, and peace (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>). In biblical history, God's presence was central to Israel's identity, symbolized by the Ark of the Covenant and the Temple. This separation is a spiritual death, a theme echoed in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>, where the wages of sin is death. The absence of God's presence means the absence of all that is good, just, and holy.<p><b>and the glory of His might</b><br>The "glory of His might" refers to the manifest power and majesty of God. In the Old Testament, God's glory was often associated with His mighty acts, such as the deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>). The New Testament reveals this glory in the person of Jesus Christ, who is the radiance of God's glory (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). The separation from this glory underscores the severity of the judgment, as it means being cut off from the source of all power and majesty. This phrase also points to the eschatological hope where believers will share in God's glory (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>), contrasting the fate of those who reject Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Thessalonians, providing guidance and encouragement to the early Christian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.

God&#8217;s justice demands it; His word guarantees it. Yet the same passage assures believers that Christ will be glorified in them. Eternal destiny hinges on one&#8217;s response to the gospel&#8212;judgment for those who spurn it, everlasting life for those who trust the Savior.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Punished with everlasting destruction</span> specifies the "vengeance" to be taken. But the word "destruction" does not stand absolutely and alone as a synonym for "annihilation." This passage, in itself, gives us no reason to suppose that the lost will be "destroyed" in the ordinary sense of the word. They are to be <span class= "ital">"</span>destroyed <span class= "ital">from the presence</span> of the Lord, and from the glory of His power"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>cut off from it for ever. The "presence"--or, more literally here, "<span class= "ital">the face</span>--of the Lord," as well as "the glory of His power," is a metaphor from the courts of Oriental kings, where only honoured courtiers are admitted to spend their time in the immediate and familiar presence of the sovereign. Familiar contact with Christ hereafter, which will be accorded to all the saved, was God's ideal intention for the lost as well, therefore it is a positive "destruction" to be banished from it. But to the Jews, who looked for a Messiah who should keep regal state, the punishment was peculiarly appropriate. The word is used besides in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm" title="For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a woman with child; and they shall not escape.">1Thessalonians 5:3</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm" title="But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.">1Timothy 6:9</a>. As for the word rendered "everlasting" (or <span class= "ital">eternal, </span>for it is the same which is used, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>), it would certainly convey to St. Paul's readers the notion of <span class= "ital">incessant duration in time;</span> it is, of course, only an adaptation to human language to speak of time at all in such a case, as we cannot tell what may take the place of time in the next dispensation; however, so far as the actual words go, there is nothing in these passages (<a href="/matthew/18-8.htm" title="Why if your hand or your foot offend you, cut them off, and cast them from you: it is better for you to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.">Matthew 18:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm" title="Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:">Matthew 25:41</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-46.htm" title="And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.">Matthew 25:46</a>; <a href="/mark/3-29.htm" title="But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost has never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.">Mark 3:29</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>; <a href="/jude/1-7.htm" title="Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.">Jude 1:7</a>) to suggest any future alteration in the state of the lost. In this, as in some other doctrines, there seem to be two distinct sets of passages, the logical reconciliation of which in our present state seems almost impossible. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who</span>; namely, the unbelieving Gentiles and Jews. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be punished;</span> literally, <span class="accented">shall pay the penalty</span>; <span class="accented">shall suffer punishment</span> (R.V.). <span class="cmt_word">With everlasting destruction;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">even everlasting destruction</span>; the words being in apposition. "Destruction" here denotes ruin, death; the word is only used in Paul's Epistles (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-8.htm">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>). The Greek word translated "everlasting," from dogmatic reasons, has given rise to much controversy. Here it appears to denote eternal - eternity to come. The eternal punishment of the wicked seems here asserted; a terrible declaration, which the mind shudders to contemplate. The observation of Olshausen is worthy of attention: "This is the only passage in Paul's Epistles in which everlasting damnation is openly declared, whereas not a few occur in which a bringing back of all the lost ones is apparently assumed as possible;" but he adds, "For the supposition that Paul did indeed in the earliest of his Epistles still teach everlasting damnation, but gave it up in later times, there exists no sufficient foundation, because the bringing back again is nowhere freely and openly declared." <span class="cmt_word">From the presence</span> (or, <span class="accented">face</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of the Lord.</span> This clause has received a threefold interpretation. Some (De Wette, Hofmann) take the preposition "from" in a causal sense, denoting the efficient cause of the punishment of the wicked - that they will be as it were blasted by the face of the Lord. Others (Chrysostom, Theophylact) take it in a temporal sense, denoting the swiftness of the punishment of the wicked - that their punishment will rise directly on the appearance of Christ (Lunemann, Alford). And others take it in a local sense, denoting banishment or separation - that the wicked will be expelled from that joy and glory which reign in the presence of Christ; they shall be banished away from the presence of the Lord. This last interpretation seems to be the correct meaning; it gives to the proposition its full force. <span class="cmt_word">And from the glory of his power;</span> not a Hebraism for "his mighty glory" (Jowett), but from that glory which has its origin in his power - the wicked will be banished from the manifestation of his power in the glorification of his saints. The punishment of the wicked on its negative side is here stated. As the presence of the glorified Jesus will constitute the happiness of heaven, so banishment from his presence will constitute the misery of hell, because the soul is then cut off from the source of all good and of all holiness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[They]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7989;&#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hoitines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3748.htm">Strong's 3748: </a> </span><span class="str2">Whosoever, whichsoever, whatsoever. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">will suffer</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#943;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(tisousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5099.htm">Strong's 5099: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pay (penalty).
