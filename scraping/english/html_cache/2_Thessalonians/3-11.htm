The term "undisciplined" suggests a lack of order and self-control, which is contrary to the Christian call to live a life of discipline and purpose. In the Greco-Roman world, discipline was highly valued, and the early church emphasized living in a manner worthy of the gospel (<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>). This phrase indicates a deviation from the expected conduct of believers, who are called to be diligent and responsible in their daily lives (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11-12</a>).<p><b>accomplishing nothing</b><br>This phrase highlights the futility of the undisciplined lifestyle. In the context of the early church, work was not only a means of provision but also a way to contribute to the community and avoid being a burden to others (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:7-10</a>). The biblical principle of work is rooted in the creation narrative, where God Himself worked and then rested (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). The lack of productivity among some Thessalonians contrasts with the biblical mandate to be fruitful and multiply in one's endeavors (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>).<p><b>but being busybodies</b><br>The term "busybodies" refers to those who meddle in the affairs of others rather than attending to their own responsibilities. This behavior disrupts community harmony and reflects a misuse of time and energy. In <a href="/1_timothy/5-13.htm">1 Timothy 5:13</a>, Paul similarly warns against idleness leading to gossip and meddling. The cultural context of the time valued community and mutual support, and such behavior would have been seen as detrimental to the unity and witness of the church. The call for believers is to live quietly, mind their own affairs, and work with their hands (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>), reflecting the character of Christ, who was focused on His mission and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the church in Thessalonica with pastoral concern and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the church was established by Paul during his second missionary journey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thessalonian_church.htm">The Thessalonian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a community of believers facing challenges related to idleness and disorderly conduct.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/idle_believers.htm">Idle Believers</a></b><br>Members of the Thessalonian church who were not working and were instead interfering in the affairs of others.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul's_companions.htm">Paul's Companions</a></b><br>Likely Silas and Timothy, who were with Paul during his ministry and shared in the writing and delivery of the letters.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_work.htm">The Importance of Work</a></b><br>Work is a God-given responsibility and a means to provide for oneself and others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_idleness.htm">Avoiding Idleness</a></b><br>Idleness can lead to disorder and meddling in others' affairs, which disrupts community harmony.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_a_disciplined_life.htm">Living a Disciplined Life</a></b><br>A disciplined life reflects Christian maturity and obedience to God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/mind_your_own_business.htm">Mind Your Own Business</a></b><br>Focusing on one's responsibilities prevents unnecessary conflict and promotes peace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_accountability.htm">Community Accountability</a></b><br>The church community should encourage and hold each other accountable to live according to biblical principles.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Thessalonians_3_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Thessalonians 3:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prevent_idleness_per_2_Thess_3_11.htm">How can we avoid becoming "idle" as warned in 2 Thessalonians 3:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_busybodies_in_2_Thess_3_11.htm">What does "busybodies" mean in the context of 2 Thessalonians 3:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_6_6-11_vs_2_Thess_3_11_on_idleness.htm">How does Proverbs 6:6-11 relate to 2 Thessalonians 3:11's warning against idleness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_inspire_diligent_work_in_others.htm">What practical steps can we take to encourage others to work diligently?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_2_Thess_3_11_in_work_service.htm">How can we apply 2 Thessalonians 3:11 in our daily work and service?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Thess_3_11_on_early_Christian_issues.htm">What does 2 Thessalonians 3:11 reveal about early Christian community challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Thess_3_11_on_believers_idleness.htm">How does 2 Thessalonians 3:11 address the issue of idleness among believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_idleness_warned_in_2_Thess_3_11.htm">Why is the warning against idleness significant in 2 Thessalonians 3:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_thessalonians_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Thessalonians 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'desolate_house'_mean.htm">What does the Bible say about minding your business?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_busybodies.htm">What does the Bible say about busybodies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_privacy.htm">What does the Bible say about minding your business?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_avoid_idle_christians_in_2_thess._3_6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6 &#8211; Why instruct believers to &#8220;keep away&#8221; from idle Christians when other scriptures emphasize mercy and acceptance toward those who struggle?

It is not quite the same as "some among you which walk disorderly," for the words "among you" represent the vague and various <span class= "ital">directions</span> taken by those aimless feet, going about from house to house, workshop to workshop.<p><span class= "bld">Working not at all, but are busybodies.</span>--This is what the disorderliness consists in, as we should have seen from <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.">2Thessalonians 3:10</a>. There is a scornful play of words here in the Greek which is lost sight of in the English: the word for "busybodies" being merely a compound form of the word "working." Quite literally, the compound means "working enough and to spare," "being overbusy," "overdoing;" then, as a man cannot possibly overdo what it is his own duty to do, it comes to signify (1) doing <span class= "ital">useless</span> things, things which concern no one, and might as well be left alone: as, for instance, magic, which is described by this word in <a href="/acts/19-19.htm" title="Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.">Acts 19:19</a>; or natural science, which is so described in the Athenians' accusation of Socrates! (2) Meddling with matters which do not concern the doer, but do concern other people: so used in <a href="/1_timothy/5-13.htm" title="And with they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.">1Timothy 5:13</a>. Prof Lightfoot suggests (<span class= "ital">On a Fresh Revision, </span>p. 59; comp. p. xviii., 2nd ed.) that the play can be kept up through the words "business" and "busy": we might perhaps say, "not being business men, but busybodies." But which of the two notions mentioned above is to be considered most prominent here we cannot tell for certain. (a) The Thessalonians do not seem to have been much carried away by the first class of danger--idle speculations, such as those of the Colossian or Ephesian Churches. Yet we cannot altogether exclude this meaning here. St. Paul's readers had been overbusy in theorising about the position of the departed at Christ's coming (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1Thessalonians 4:15</a>, Note), and had been so eager over their idle doctrines of the Advent as to falsify, if not actually to forge, communications from St. Paul (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2Thessalonians 2:2</a>). Such false inquisitiveness and gossiping discussions might well be described by the Greek word with which we are dealing. (<span class= "ital">b</span>) Everything, however, points to a more practical form of the same disposition to mask idleness under cloak of work; feverish excitement, which leads men to meddle and interfere with others, perhaps to spend time in "religious" work which ought not to have been spared from every-day duties. (See <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm" title="And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;">1Thessalonians 4:11-12</a>, and Notes.) There is nothing to show definitely how this busy idleness arose, but it may very probably be the shaken and troubled condition of mind spoken of in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2Thessalonians 2:2</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>; the reason for the allusion to this proverb. <span class="cmt_word">We hear.</span> The apostle had either heard from Timothy who had rejoined him from Thessalonica, or from the report of the bearers of the First Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">That there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.</span> There is here a paranomasia or play upon words, the words "working" and "busybodies" being cognate. It is difficult to preserve the resemblance in a translation. "Busy only with what is not their own business" (Jowett); "Working at no business, but being busybodies" (Ellicott); "Not busy, but busybodies" (Wordsworth). The word "busybodies" denotes busy in useless and superfluous things, about which one need not trouble himself - occupied about trifles. The apostle refers to the fanatical excitement in the Church on account of which the Thessalonians, instead of occupying themselves with the fulfilment of the duties of their earthly calling, busied themselves about matters which were unprofitable and vain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Yet</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#940;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
