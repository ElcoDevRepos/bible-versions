The opposition and self-exaltation indicate a direct challenge to all forms of deity and religious reverence, suggesting a figure who seeks to usurp divine authority. This echoes the pride and rebellion of Satan, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-14</a>, where Lucifer desires to ascend above the stars of God. The historical context of the Roman Empire, with its pantheon of gods and emperor worship, provides a backdrop for understanding the audacity of such a claim. The phrase also connects to <a href="/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a>, where a king exalts himself above every god, indicating a prophetic consistency regarding end-times figures who defy divine order.<p><b>So he will seat himself in the temple of God,</b><br>The act of seating himself in the temple signifies a claim to divine status and authority. Historically, the temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and the dwelling place of God's presence. This act of desecration is reminiscent of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who desecrated the Second Temple, as described in <a href="/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31 and 1</a> Maccabees 1:54. Theologically, this act is seen as the ultimate blasphemy, a usurpation of God's rightful place. The reference to the temple also raises questions about eschatological events, such as the rebuilding of a physical temple or a metaphorical understanding of the church as the temple (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>).<p><b>proclaiming himself to be God.</b><br>This proclamation is the culmination of the man of lawlessness's rebellion, echoing the serpent's temptation in <a href="/genesis/3-5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>, where the promise was to be like God. It reflects the ultimate deception and delusion, as warned in <a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>, where false Christs and prophets perform signs and wonders. The claim to divinity is a direct affront to the Shema, the Jewish declaration of God's oneness (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). In Christian eschatology, this act is seen as a precursor to the Second Coming of Christ, who will defeat all false claims to divinity (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>).

Being merely descriptive epithets, we are not at liberty to press the present tense, and say that the Man of Sin was already thus acting at the time St. Paul wrote. The word for "the opposer," or "adversary," is a pretty close rendering of the name "Satan," and passed, in ecclesiastical Greek into a synonym for it. The acts here attributed to the Man of Sin are peculiarly Satanic. (Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/14-12.htm" title="How are you fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how are you cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations!">Isaiah 14:12-14</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-6.htm" title="For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,">2Timothy 3:6</a>.) Of course, however, we must not confound Satan himself with his human minister.<p><span class= "bld">Above all that is called God.</span>--The translation here is not quite exact.

"Every God so called" includes the false gods <span class= "ital">with</span> the true God (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/8-5.htm" title="For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)">1Corinthians 8:5</a>): true or false, it matters not to jealous Antichrist, who would have nothing worshipped but himself. This explains the addition of the little clause, "or that is worshipped." Many things received religious homage from men without being called gods; and the original word (<span class= "ital">sebasma</span>) may perhaps be designed to hint at one such worship, viz., the worship of the Augustus (<span class= "ital">Sebastos</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It would be far-fetched, however, to see in this a direct prophecy of conflict between Antichrist and the Civil Power; although it must be admitted that even the word "gods" is <span class= "ital">sometimes</span> used of secular rulers (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/context/psalms/82-1.htm" title="God stands in the congregation of the mighty; he judges among the gods.">Psalm 82:1-6</a>; <a href="/john/10-34.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?">John 10:34</a>), in which sense some take it here. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who opposeth;</span> or, <span class="accented">the opposer</span>, taken substantively. The object of opposition is not so much believers, as Christ; he is antichrist, the opponent of Christ. And yet antichrist is not Satan, the great adversary (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>), for he is expressly distinguished from him (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>), but the instrument of Satan. As Satan entered into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of perdition, so does he take possession of the man of sin. <span class="cmt_word">And exalteth himself above;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">against</span>, in a hostile manner. <span class="cmt_word">All that is called God;</span> not only against all the false gods of the heathen, but also against the true God (comp. <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Or that is worshipped;</span> that is an object of worship.

It is a favourite metaphor of Paul to compare believers in particular, or the Church in general, to the temple of God (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/3-17.htm">1 Corinthians 3:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20-22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Showing</span> - exhibiting - <span class="cmt_word">himself that he is God.</span> His sitting in the temple of God was an assertion of his divinity; he claimed to be regarded and worshipped as God. This was the crowning act of his impiety; not only, like the Roman emperors, he demanded to be worshipped as one of many gods, but he claimed to himself the prerogative of the Godhead, not only to the exclusion of the false gods of heathenism, but even of the tree God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[He]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
