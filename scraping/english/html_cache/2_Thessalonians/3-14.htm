The context here is the early Christian community in Thessalonica, which faced challenges such as false teachings and disorderly conduct. Paul&#8217;s letters often served as a guide for maintaining doctrinal purity and community order. The act of taking note implies a careful observation and discernment within the community. This echoes Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a> about addressing sin within the church. The instructions given in the letter include exhortations to live a disciplined life, work diligently, and hold fast to the traditions taught by the apostles.<p><b>Do not associate with him,</b><br>This directive serves as a form of church discipline aimed at correcting behavior and maintaining the integrity of the community. The cultural context of the time placed a high value on communal living and shared beliefs, making disassociation a significant action. This practice is consistent with other New Testament teachings, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>, where Paul advises the church to avoid associating with those who claim to be believers but live in sin. The purpose is not punitive but restorative, encouraging repentance and reconciliation.<p><b>so that he may be ashamed.</b><br>The goal of inducing shame is not to humiliate but to bring about a realization of wrongdoing and a desire for repentance. In the historical context, shame was a powerful social tool used to correct behavior and restore relationships. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of repentance and restoration, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/7-9.htm">2 Corinthians 7:9-10</a>, where godly sorrow leads to repentance. The ultimate aim is to restore the individual to fellowship with the community and with God, reflecting the redemptive work of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who authored the letter to the Thessalonians, providing guidance and instruction to the early Christian community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>- A city in Macedonia where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.

The marginal version, "by <span class= "ital">an</span> Epistle," is impossible, for in the Greek the definite article appears. It might, if the context suited, be attached to the following clause, instead of the foregoing, and translated, "by means of the Epistle signify that man," meaning "in your answer." But there is nothing to show that St. Paul was expecting any answer; and, for another thing, he has given them full directions for dealing with the case themselves, so that it would be superfluous to send the particulars to St. Paul. For several other weighty reasons it is best to attach the words to the hypothetical clause; and the sense will be, "There can be no excuse now. It was possible to forget or misinterpret our verbal tradition, painstaking and definite though it was; possible also to ignore the example which we set; but now you have it in black and white, and the man who does not submit to our directions in this form must be visited severely." There are at least three places besides this in St. Paul's writings where "the Epistle" stands absolutely for "the present Epistle," viz., <a href="/romans/16-22.htm" title="I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.">Romans 16:22</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-16.htm" title=" And when this letter is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you likewise read the letter from Laodicea.">Colossians 4:16</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-27.htm" title="I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.">1Thessalonians 5:27</a>; possibly a fourth might be added, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-9.htm" title="I wrote to you in an letter not to company with fornicators:">1Corinthians 5:9</a>; only once in a very clear context it refers to a former Letter (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-8.htm" title="For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same letter has made you sorry, though it were but for a season.">2Corinthians 7:8</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if any man obey not our word by this Epistle, note that man.</span> Some attach the words, "by this Epistle," to" note that man," and render the clause, "Note that man by an epistle to me." Thus Calvin: "He desires that they may be reported to him, that he may reprove them by his authority." So also in the margin of our A.V.: "Signify that man by an epistle." But the presence of the article denoting a definite Epistle, "this Epistle," and the order of the words in the Greek, are against this interpretation. Others render the clause, "Note that man by this Epistle;" point out to him the injunctions and the warnings which are contained in it against such a line of conduct; but such a meaning is too artificial. It is better, therefore, to attach the words, "by this Epistle," to "our word," as in the A.V.: "If any man obey not our word by this Epistle." "Note that man;" that is, set a mark upon him, note him for the sake of avoidance, excommunicate him from your society. And have no company with him. Exclude him from your fellowship meetings, your love feasts. <span class="cmt_word">That he may be ashamed;</span> the design or object of thus noting him. As if the apostle had said, "Bring the force of Christian opinion to bear upon him. Show your moral indignation by excluding him from the Christian community."
