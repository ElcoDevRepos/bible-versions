This reflects the early church's challenges with false teachings and the need for discernment. The Greek word for "disconcerted" implies a sudden, unsettling movement, suggesting that the Thessalonians were experiencing confusion or fear. This exhortation is consistent with Jesus' warnings in <a href="/matthew/24-4.htm">Matthew 24:4-6</a> about not being deceived by false claims regarding the end times.<p><b>by any spirit or message or letter</b><br>Paul warns against three potential sources of misinformation: spiritual revelations, spoken messages, or written letters. This indicates the variety of ways false teachings could infiltrate the church. The mention of "spirit" suggests false prophecies or spiritual experiences, while "message" and "letter" imply verbal or written communication. This reflects the broader New Testament concern with false prophets and teachers, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a> and <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>.<p><b>seeming to be from us</b><br>The phrase indicates that the false teachings were being presented with an air of apostolic authority, possibly even forged letters. This highlights the early church's struggle with maintaining doctrinal purity and the importance of verifying the authenticity of teachings. The issue of false letters is also addressed in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:17</a>, where Paul emphasizes the distinguishing marks of his genuine letters.<p><b>alleging that the Day of the Lord has already come</b><br>The false teaching in question was that the Day of the Lord, a time of divine judgment and fulfillment of prophecy, had already occurred. This claim contradicted Paul's previous teachings and caused confusion among the Thessalonians. The Day of the Lord is a significant eschatological event referenced throughout Scripture, including in <a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6-9</a> and <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2:1-2</a>.

By testing every message against Scripture and remembering the clear, future markers of the Day of the Lord, believers can stand firm, unshaken, and full of hope.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Not soon shaken.</span>--The meaning would be clearer if we inserted "so" before "soon," for it does not mean vaguely that they were for the future not to be lightly shaken, but (as in <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm" title="I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:">Galatians 1:6</a>) that they had already been shaken, and that in an unconscionably short time since their first teaching on the subject.<p><span class= "bld">In mind.</span>--In the original it is, <span class= "ital">from your mind;</span> <span class= "ital">from your reason,</span><p><span class= "bld">Be troubled.</span>--The tense of the verb "be troubled" differs in the Greek from that of "be shaken"; for the "driving out of their wits" is regarded as a single act; the "agitation," or being troubled, as a chronic condition, into which there was fear of their falling. This shaking and trouble probably brought about the disorders spoken of in 2 Thessalonians 3. The instruments by which men had partly driven the Thessalonians out of their wits already were three:--(1) "Through spirit," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>by pretended manifestations of the Holy Spirit's power, whether through false signs or, more probably, through "prophesyings." (See <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm" title="Despise not prophesyings.">1Thessalonians 5:20-22</a>, where the fear of some abuse of prophecy is clearly marked already.) (2) "Through word," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Word of mouth, as opposed to the written letter next mentioned. Most modern commentators seem rightly to take the words "as from us" with this clause as well as with the next; some persons misrepresented what they had heard the Apostles say on the topic, or pretended to have been intrusted with a message from them. (3) "Through letter;" apparently forged letters, purporting to be from (or, literally, <span class= "ital">through</span>) St. Paul, had been circulated. (See Note on <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm" title="The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.">2Thessalonians 3:17</a>.) "Word" and "letter" occur again in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our letter.">2Thessalonians 2:15</a> as his ordinary means of teaching.<p><span class= "bld">As that the day of Christ is at hand</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "to the effect that it is, "--giving the contents of the pretended revelation; for "as that" follows grammatically upon "spirit, word, letter," not upon "shaken, troubled." The word for "is at hand" implies a very close proximity indeed, the participle, in fact (like our word "instant"), being used for "present," <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/galatians/1-4.htm" title="Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:">Galatians 1:4</a>. Probably the form which the false doctrine at Thessalonica was beginning to take was that the day of the Lord had already set in, thus confusing the whole idea of a personal, visible Advent, just as, at a later period, Hymenaeus and Philetus confused the true doctrine of resurrection by affirming that it was already past (<a href="/2_timothy/2-18.htm" title="Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.">2Timothy 2:18</a>). St. Paul not only denies vigorously that the day is come, but proceeds in the next verse to show that the signs of its approach are not yet exhibited. The best reading gives "the day of <span class= "ital">the Lord," </span>not "of Christ." (See Note on <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That</span>; to the end that, the purpose for which the apostle besought the Thessalonians. <span class="cmt_word">Ye be not soon</span>; <span class="accented">quickly.</span> This has been variously interpreted, "so soon after my exhortation," or "so soon after my departure from Thessalonica," or "so soon after your reception of the gospel," or "so soon after this opinion of the imminence of Christ's coming was promulgated." Others refer it to manner rather than to time - "soon and with small reason" (Alford). <span class="cmt_word">Shaken</span>; agitated like the waves by a storm, as the word signifies. <span class="cmt_word">In mind;</span> or <span class="accented">rather, from your mind</span>;<span class="accented">from your sober reason. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Or be troubled;</span> a still stronger expression; "terrified." <span class="cmt_word">Neither by spirit;</span> not any falsely understood prophecies of the Old Testament, nor any mistaken revelations, whether by visions or dreams; but prophetical discourses delivered by members of the Church in a state of excitement, announcing the immediate coming of Christ, and which were mistaken for Divine communications. There does not appear to have been any intention to deceive; the Thessalonians erred in neglecting "to try the spirits" and to "prove the prophecics." <span class="cmt_word">Nor by word;</span> not any traditional word of Christ, nor any misinterpretation of his prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, nor a calm discourse in distinction from prophetic utterances; but the report of some of the apostle's words, either erroneous or misunderstood. <span class="cmt_word">Nor by letter.</span> Not the apostle's former Epistle to the Thessalonians, the passages in which concerning the advent had been misinterpreted (Paley); for, if this were the case, the apostle would have expressed himself more plainly and would not have repudiated it; but some letter, either forged in the apostle's name or pretending to inculcate his views. <span class="cmt_word">As from us.</span> These words apply to the last two particulars: "Let no pretended saying or pretended letter of mine disturb you in this matter." <span class="cmt_word">As that</span> - to the effect that - <span class="cmt_word">the day of Christ;</span> or, as the best manuscripts read, <span class="accented">of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Is at hand;</span> literally, <span class="accented">is present</span>, so R.V. The verb is so translated in the other passages where it occurs (<a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-22.htm">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>), except in <a href="/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a>, where it ought also to have been so rendered. It is, however, difficult to conceive how the Thessalonians could think that the day of the Lord was actually present. We cannot imagine that they thought that Christ had already come for judgment. To escape the difficulty, some conceive that "the day of the Lord" is not identical with "the coming of the Lord," but that, besides the actual advent, it includes the events which are its antecedents and concomitants (Eadie). It appears, however, best to suppose that the word is a strong expression for the imminence of that day; that the hour of the advent was about in strike. The Thessalonians ought always to be living in a state of preparation for the day of the Lord, as that day would come suddenly and unexpectedly; but they were not to be so impressed with a sense of its immediateness as to be deprived of their sober reason. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
