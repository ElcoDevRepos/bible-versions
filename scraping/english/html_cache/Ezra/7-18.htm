The mention of "brothers" emphasizes the communal and familial nature of the Jewish people, highlighting their shared responsibility in the religious and cultural restoration of Jerusalem. This reflects the broader biblical theme of community and unity among God's people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>.<p><b>may do whatever seems best</b><br>This indicates a level of trust and autonomy given to Ezra and his companions. It suggests that they were seen as wise and capable leaders, entrusted with making decisions for the welfare of the community. This autonomy is significant in the context of the Persian Empire, where local leaders were often given authority to manage their own affairs, as long as they remained loyal to the empire. It also reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where God's people are entrusted with resources and responsibilities to manage wisely, as seen in the Parable of the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<p><b>with the rest of the silver and gold</b><br>The silver and gold mentioned here were part of the offerings and resources provided by the Persian king Artaxerxes for the temple in Jerusalem. This reflects the historical context of the Persian policy of supporting local religions to maintain peace and loyalty within the empire. The provision of these resources underscores the importance of the temple in Jewish worship and the restoration efforts. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's provision for His people, as seen in the Exodus narrative where the Israelites received gold and silver from the Egyptians (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>).<p><b>according to the will of your God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the centrality of God's will in the decision-making process. It reflects the biblical principle that all actions and decisions should align with God's purposes and commands. This is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, where obedience to God's will is paramount, as seen in Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>). It also highlights the covenant relationship between God and His people, where they are called to live in accordance with His laws and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest, Ezra was a leader among the Jewish exiles returning from Babylon to Jerusalem.
