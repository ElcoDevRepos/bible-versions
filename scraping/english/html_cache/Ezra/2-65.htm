The large number of servants indicates the wealth and status of some returning families, as owning servants was a sign of prosperity. In the ancient Near Eastern context, servants were often integral to household operations, performing various tasks and contributing to the economic stability of the family. The mention of both menservants and maidservants reflects the patriarchal structure of society, where households were typically led by male figures, but women also played crucial roles in domestic and economic activities. This detail underscores the comprehensive nature of the return, involving not just the free Israelites but also those who served them, emphasizing the restoration of the community as a whole.<p><b>as well as their 200 male and female singers</b><br>The inclusion of singers among the returning exiles is significant, as it points to the importance of worship and music in Israelite culture and religious practice. Music played a vital role in temple worship, and the presence of singers suggests a focus on reestablishing proper worship in Jerusalem. The distinction between male and female singers indicates that both genders participated in the musical aspects of worship, which was a common practice in ancient Israel. This aligns with other biblical references to music and singing in worship, such as in the Psalms and the accounts of temple worship in Chronicles. The restoration of singers also foreshadows the rebuilding of the temple and the reestablishment of religious rituals, which were central to the identity and spiritual life of the Jewish people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem from Babylon.

Now Ezra notes further resources that accompanied the remnant, underscoring God&#8217;s comprehensive provision. <a href="/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66-67</a> repeats the same wording, confirming the list&#8217;s reliability.
