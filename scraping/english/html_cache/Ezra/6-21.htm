The return from exile was a fulfillment of God's promise to restore His people after 70 years of captivity, as prophesied by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). The "it" they ate refers to the Passover meal, a significant event commemorating God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt. This return and celebration signify a renewal of covenant relationship with God, emphasizing themes of redemption and restoration.<p><b>together with all who had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the peoples of the land</b><br>This highlights the inclusion of non-Israelites who chose to follow the God of Israel, separating themselves from pagan practices. The "peoples of the land" refers to the surrounding nations and their idolatrous customs. This separation is a call to holiness, echoing the Levitical laws that required Israel to be distinct from other nations (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament theme of Gentiles being grafted into the faith (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>).<p><b>to seek the LORD, the God of Israel</b><br>This phrase underscores the purpose of their separation: a sincere pursuit of the true God. Seeking the LORD involves repentance, worship, and obedience, aligning with the Deuteronomic call to love and serve God with all one's heart and soul (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>). It reflects a heart transformation and commitment to God's covenant, which is central to the faith journey.
