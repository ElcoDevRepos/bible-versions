This rebuilding effort was not just a physical construction project but a spiritual renewal for the Jewish community. The term "prospered" indicates that their efforts were successful and blessed, suggesting divine favor. This prosperity can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to restore His people after the Babylonian exile, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>.<p><b>through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo</b><br>Haggai and Zechariah were prophets who played crucial roles in encouraging the people to complete the temple. Haggai's messages, found in the Book of Haggai, emphasized the importance of prioritizing God's house over personal affairs, while Zechariah's visions, recorded in the Book of Zechariah, provided hope and future restoration. Their prophetic ministries were instrumental in motivating the people, showing the power of God's word in guiding and inspiring His people. This highlights the importance of prophecy in the life of Israel and its role in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>They finished building according to the command of the God of Israel</b><br>The completion of the temple was in obedience to God's command, reflecting the centrality of divine instruction in the life of Israel. This phrase underscores the sovereignty of God in the affairs of nations and His faithfulness to His covenant promises. The temple's completion was a significant event, symbolizing the restoration of proper worship and the presence of God among His people.<p><b>and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia</b><br>The mention of these Persian kings highlights the historical context of the Jewish return from exile.

Artaxerxes I, though not directly involved in the temple's construction, later supported the Jewish community (<a href="/ezra/7-11.htm">Ezra 7:11-26</a>).

Just as the later Artaxerxes is introduced, so the earlier Cyrus is, in this comprehensive review.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the elders of the Jews builded</span>. See above, <a href="/ezra/5-5.htm">Ezra 5:5, 9</a>. Probably the same as "the chief of the fathers" of <a href="/ezra/2-68.htm">Ezra 2:68</a>, and <a href="/ezra/3-12.htm">Ezra 3:12</a>. While the younger men were those who actually laboured, the elders superintended the work. Zerubbabel and Jeshua are no doubt included among them<span class="cmt_word">. And they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai... and Zechariah.</span> It can well be understood that Haggai's earnest exhortations, his warnings, his threats, his sarcastic reproaches (<a href="/haggai/1-4.htm">Haggai 1:4, 9</a>), his prophecies of a coming glory to the house greater than any known previously (<a href="/haggai/2-9.htm">Haggai 2:9</a>), would rouse the spirit of the people, and make them labour diligently and perseveringly; but the visions of Zechariah seem less calculated to stir popular feeling. Still the knowledge that the angels of God were interesting themselves in the restoration of the temple (<a href="/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9-21</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-3.htm">Zechariah 2:3</a>, etc.), and the many promises that God would "comfort Zion," and "choose Jerusalem" (<a href="/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a>; <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>), and that the temple should assuredly be brought to completion (<a href="/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>), helped no doubt to strengthen the hands of Zerubbabel, and to keep up the zeal of the people<span class="cmt_word">. According to the commandment of Cyrus</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia</span>. The commandments of Cyrus and of Darius have been set forth by the writer (see <a href="/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3</a>; <a href="/ezra/6-3.htm">Ezra 6:3-5, 7</a>); but nothing has been said as yet of any commandment given by any Artaxerxes to "build" or "finish" the house. On the contrary, the only Arta-xerxes mentioned has been declared to have expressly forbidden the work to proceed (<a href="/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7-22</a>). The Artaxerxes of that place, moreover, reigned between Cyrus and Darius, whereas this Artaxerxes should, by the position of his name, be one of the successors of Darius. It has been suggested that Xerxes is intended, and that he may have been associated with his father during the building of the temple. But as Xerxes was the son of Atossa, whom Darius did not marry until he had ascended the throne (Herod., 3:88), he cannot have been more than five years old when the temple was finished. Nor was he ever associated on the throne by his father. Xerxes, therefore, cannot be meant. The next king to Xerxes, however, who really bore the name of Artaxerxes was a favourer of the Jews, and did give commandment to "beautify," and in that sense "finish," the house of the Lord (see <a href="/ezra/7-20.htm">Ezra 7:20, 27</a>). We must suppose, therefore, that he is the person intended. The objection that the name is not spelt the same, but has a <span class="accented">samech</span> in one place instead of a <span class="accented">schin</span>, is too minute to require consideration. The Persians themselves spelt the name of Artaxerxes in more ways than one (Rawlinson, 'Cuneiform Inscriptions of Persia,' vol. 1. p. 348). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/6-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the Jewish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1497;&#1461;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;y&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3062.htm">Strong's 3062: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jews -- inhabitants of Judah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">elders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
