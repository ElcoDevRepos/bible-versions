This timing underscores the importance of reestablishing worship and aligns with the agricultural cycle, marking a new year and a time of renewal. The first day of Tishri is traditionally associated with the blowing of trumpets, symbolizing a call to repentance and a reminder of God's sovereignty.<p><b>the Israelites began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD</b><br>Burnt offerings were a central aspect of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. These offerings were entirely consumed by fire, representing the worshiper's total surrender to God. The act of offering burnt offerings before the temple's foundation was laid highlights the priority of worship and obedience to God over physical structures. It reflects the Israelites' desire to restore their covenant relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>, where the regulations for burnt offerings are detailed.<p><b>although the foundation of the temple of the LORD had not been laid</b><br>The absence of the temple's foundation indicates the Israelites' commitment to reestablishing worship despite incomplete physical infrastructure. This act of faith and devotion is reminiscent of the patriarchs, such as Abraham, who built altars and worshiped God without a permanent temple (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7-8</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament understanding that worship is not confined to a specific location, as Jesus explained to the Samaritan woman in <a href="/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21-24</a>.

After decades in exile, Israel is literally beginning again.<p>&#8226; By taking action on the exact day God prescribed, the returned exiles show that obedience to the Word guides their schedule, not convenience (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/8-2.htm">Nehemiah 8:2&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Israelites began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Before a single stone is set for the new temple, an altar goes up (<a href="/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2&#8211;3</a>). Worship is the first priority.<p>&#8226; A burnt offering is wholly consumed on the altar, picturing total consecration (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>).<p>&#8211; Daily offerings (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38&#8211;42</a>)<p>&#8211; Special new-moon offerings (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-31.htm">1 Chronicles 23:31</a>)<p>&#8211; Voluntary, grateful sacrifices (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>)<p>&#8226; They &#8220;began&#8221; and kept going (<a href="/ezra/3-5.htm">Ezra 3:5</a>).
