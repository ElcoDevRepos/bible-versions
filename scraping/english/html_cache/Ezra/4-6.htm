Xerxes, also known as Ahasuerus in the Book of Esther, was the son of Darius the Great. His reign is marked by significant events, including his failed invasion of Greece. The mention of Xerxes situates the narrative within a specific historical context, highlighting the ongoing challenges faced by the Jewish community during the Persian period. This period was characterized by political instability and power struggles within the empire, which often affected the smaller provinces like Judah.<p><b>an accusation was lodged</b><br>The term "accusation" indicates a formal complaint or charge brought against the Jewish people. In the context of the Persian Empire, such accusations could be politically motivated, often stemming from local opposition to the rebuilding efforts in Jerusalem. This reflects the broader theme of opposition faced by the Jewish community as they sought to reestablish themselves in their ancestral homeland. The use of legal and political means to hinder the Jews is a recurring theme in the post-exilic period, as seen in other parts of Ezra and Nehemiah.<p><b>against the people of Judah and Jerusalem</b><br>This specifies the target of the accusation: the Jewish community residing in the region of Judah, with Jerusalem as its center. The people of Judah were the descendants of those who had returned from the Babylonian exile, and they were in the process of rebuilding the temple and the city. The opposition they faced was not only political but also spiritual, as their efforts to restore worship and community life were seen as a threat by surrounding peoples. This opposition is reminiscent of the challenges faced by God's people throughout biblical history, where faithfulness to God's commands often led to conflict with surrounding nations. The mention of both Judah and Jerusalem underscores the significance of Jerusalem as the spiritual and political heart of the Jewish people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/x/xerxes.htm">Xerxes</a></b><br>Also known as Ahasuerus, he was a Persian king who reigned from 486 to 465 BC.

Even so, the broader narrative shows the Lord overruling every charge and advancing His plan, reassuring believers that no earthly accusation can thwart the will of the King of kings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">In the beginning of his reign.</span>--This Ahasuerus, another name for Cambyses, reigned seven years; and his accession to the throne was the time seized by the Samaritans for their "accusation," of which we hear nothing more; suffice that the building languished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the reign of Ahasuerus.</span> Some critics regard this Ahasuerus as identical with the Ahasuerus of Esther, who is generally allowed to be Xerxes, the son and successor of Darius Hystaspis, and the invader of Greece. In this case the Artaxerxes of the next verse is taken to be Artaxerxes Longimanus, and the entire passage, from ver. 6 to ver. 23 inclusively, is regarded as parenthetic, having reference to events which happened later than any of those recorded in ch. 6. But the evident <span class="accented">nexus</span> of vers. 23, 24 is fatal to this view, which has nothing in its favour beyond the sequence of the royal names, an uncertain argument in this instance, since we know that Persian kings had often more than one name. If on these grounds we reject the proposed identification, and regard the chapter as chronologically consecutive, Ahasuerus here must be explained as Cambyses, and the Artaxerxes of ver. 7 as Smerdis. This is the view most usually taken, and it seems to the present writer to present fewer difficulties than any other. <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the beginning of his reign.</span> As soon as ever a new king mounted the throne, fresh representations were made to him by the "adversaries," lest the work should be recommenced<span class="cmt_word">.
