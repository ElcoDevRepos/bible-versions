These articles were originally taken by Nebuchadnezzar during the Babylonian conquest (<a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>, <a href="/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>). The return of these items signifies the restoration of worship in the temple, fulfilling prophecies of restoration (<a href="/jeremiah/27-21.htm">Jeremiah 27:21-22</a>). The specific mention of gold and silver underscores the wealth and splendor of the temple, reflecting the glory of God. The number 5,400, though not detailed in the preceding verses, suggests completeness and abundance, symbolizing God's provision and faithfulness.<p><b>Sheshbazzar brought all these along</b><br>Sheshbazzar is identified as the prince of Judah (<a href="/ezra/1-8.htm">Ezra 1:8</a>), possibly a title for Zerubbabel or another leader. His role in transporting these articles indicates his leadership and responsibility in the restoration process. The act of bringing these items back is a physical manifestation of God's promise to restore His people and their worship. Sheshbazzar's leadership can be seen as a type of Christ, who leads His people from captivity to freedom.<p><b>when the exiles went up from Babylon to Jerusalem.</b><br>This movement from Babylon to Jerusalem is a fulfillment of God's promise to bring His people back to their land (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). The phrase "went up" is significant, as Jerusalem is geographically higher than Babylon, but it also carries spiritual connotations of returning to a place of worship and covenant relationship with God. This return is a precursor to the ultimate return and restoration through Christ, who brings His people to the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>).
