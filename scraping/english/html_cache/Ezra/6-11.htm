The context is the rebuilding of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem, which had been halted due to opposition. Darius's decree supports the continuation of the temple's construction, reflecting the policy of the Persian rulers to allow subject peoples to practice their religions. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, where the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord.<p><b>a beam is to be torn from his house and raised up</b><br>The punishment described is severe and symbolic. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the house represented a person's legacy and security. Tearing a beam from one's house signifies the destruction of one's stability and honor. This act also serves as a public warning to others, illustrating the seriousness of defying royal decrees. The imagery of a beam being raised up can be seen as a precursor to the crucifixion, where Jesus was lifted up on a cross, drawing a typological connection to Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>and he is to be impaled on it</b><br>Impalement was a common form of execution in ancient Persia, known for its brutality. This method of punishment underscores the gravity of opposing the king's command. Theologically, it reflects the biblical principle of reaping what one sows, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. The impalement can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the crucifixion of Christ, who bore the curse of sin on the cross, as described in <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>.<p><b>And his own house shall be made a pile of rubble for this offense</b><br>The destruction of one's house as a consequence of disobedience serves as a stark warning. In biblical terms, a house reduced to rubble signifies complete desolation and judgment, similar to the fate of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6-26.htm">Joshua 6:26</a>. This imagery is also prophetic, pointing to the ultimate judgment and destruction of those who oppose God's purposes. Theologically, it emphasizes the theme of divine justice and the consequences of sin, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_darius.htm">King Darius</a></b><br>The Persian king who issued the decree to support the rebuilding of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem.

In <a href="/ezra/6-8.htm">Ezra 6:8</a> Darius has just pledged imperial funds for the temple; verse 11 shows he will personally protect that investment.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly shows earthly rulers furthering God&#8217;s purposes even when they do not consciously honor Him (<a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1-5</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-4</a>). The decree therefore illustrates the Lord&#8217;s sovereign hand guiding history so His house in Jerusalem will be finished &#8220;on the sixth day of the twelfth month&#8221; (<a href="/ezra/6-15.htm">Ezra 6:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that if any man interferes with this directive,</b><p>&#8226; The target is anyone&#8212;Jew or Gentile&#8212;who tries to halt temple construction.

By confiscating a timber from the culprit&#8217;s house, Darius turns the rebel&#8217;s security into an instrument of judgment&#8212;an Old Testament &#8220;measure for measure&#8221; principle (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-19.htm">Deuteronomy 19:19-21</a>).<p>&#8226; The public removal of the beam also serves as a stark visual: anyone who dismantles God&#8217;s temple will see his own dwelling dismantled first.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he is to be impaled on it.</b><p>&#8226; Persian law used impalement or crucifixion-like suspension to execute traitors (<a href="/esther/7-9.htm">Esther 7:9-10</a>).

The verse piles sanction upon sanction&#8212;confiscation, public execution, and total demolition&#8212;to show how zealously God safeguards His purposes.

Rather, "this edict." To alter the terms of a royal decree would in any country be a heinous offence. In Persia, where the monarch was absolute, and where decrees were regarded as "altering not" (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8, 12</a>), it was a crime of the deepest dye. Hence the severity of the punishment threatened. The punishment has been explained as crucifixion, impalement, and "whipping at a post;" but there seems to be no real doubt that crucifixion is intended. Great criminals were almost always crucified by the Persians (see Brisson, 'De Regno Persarum,' 2. pp. 327-329; and comp. 'Behist. Inscr.,' col. 2. par. 14; col. 3. par. 8). <span class="cmt_word">Let his house be made a dunghill</span> Some render "<span class="accented">be</span> confiscated," but wrongly.
