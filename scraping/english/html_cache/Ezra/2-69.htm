It reflects the voluntary and proportional nature of contributions, emphasizing the heart's willingness over the amount given. This principle is rooted in the Old Testament, where offerings were often given according to one's means (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-17.htm">Deuteronomy 16:17</a>).<p><b>they gave to the treasury for this work</b><br>The treasury here refers to the collective fund for the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem. This act of giving was crucial for the restoration of worship and the community's spiritual life. The "work" signifies the rebuilding efforts led by Zerubbabel and Jeshua, which were central to re-establishing Jewish identity post-exile (<a href="/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5-6</a>).<p><b>61,000 darics of gold</b><br>The daric was a gold coin used in the Persian Empire, named after Darius the Great. This substantial amount indicates the wealth and commitment of the returnees. The use of darics underscores the historical context of Persian influence and the economic conditions of the time. Gold, often associated with divinity and kingship, can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate King and divine figure.<p><b>5,000 minas of silver</b><br>Silver, like gold, was a valuable commodity and often used in temple service (<a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>). The mina was a unit of weight, and this large contribution reflects the community's dedication. Silver is frequently associated with redemption in the Bible, pointing to the redemptive work of Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><b>and 100 priestly garments</b><br>Priestly garments were essential for the Levitical service, symbolizing purity and holiness (<a href="/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2-4</a>). The provision of these garments indicates a focus on restoring proper worship practices. The garments can be seen as a type of Christ's righteousness, which clothes believers (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).

This was a gold coin, stamped with the figure of a Persian king, wearing his crown, and armed with a bow and arrow. According to the most exact computation, each such coin contained somewhat more pure gold than an English guinea, and was worth &pound;1 1s. 10.5d. of our money.
