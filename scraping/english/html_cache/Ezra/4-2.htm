Zerubbabel, a descendant of King David, was the governor of Judah and played a key role in the rebuilding of the temple. The "heads of the families" refers to the leaders of the various clans or tribes who returned from exile. This approach signifies a request for collaboration in the temple rebuilding project, highlighting the importance of leadership in decision-making processes.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Let us build with you</b><br>The offer to help build the temple seems cooperative, but it is important to understand the underlying motives. Historically, the people making this offer were likely Samaritans, descendants of Israelites who had intermarried with foreign settlers brought in by the Assyrians. Their request to participate in the temple construction could be seen as an attempt to integrate or influence the religious practices of the returning exiles.<p><b>because, like you, we seek your God</b><br>This claim suggests a shared religious interest, but it is met with skepticism by the Jewish leaders. The Samaritans practiced a syncretistic form of worship, blending the worship of Yahweh with other deities, which was contrary to the pure worship commanded in the Mosaic Law. This phrase highlights the tension between maintaining religious purity and the pressures of external influences.<p><b>and have been sacrificing to Him since the time of King Esar-haddon of Assyria</b><br>King Esar-haddon reigned from 681 to 669 BC and was responsible for repopulating Samaria with foreign peoples after the Assyrian conquest. These settlers adopted a form of Yahweh worship, but it was mixed with pagan practices. The mention of Esar-haddon provides a historical anchor, indicating that these people had a long-standing, albeit compromised, tradition of worshiping Yahweh.<p><b>who brought us here.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the Assyrian policy of relocating conquered peoples to prevent rebellion. The settlers were brought to the region by Assyrian kings, including Esar-haddon, to replace the exiled Israelites. This relocation resulted in a mixed population with a diluted form of Israelite religion, which the returning exiles viewed with suspicion.

They attributed this last colonization to Esar-haddon.
