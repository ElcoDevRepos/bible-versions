Confession is a key theme throughout the Bible, seen in passages like 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, where believers are encouraged to confess their sins to receive forgiveness. The reference to "the God of your fathers" connects the Israelites to their ancestral covenant with God, reminding them of their heritage and the faithfulness of God to their forefathers, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This connection underscores the continuity of God's promises and the need for the Israelites to return to the covenantal relationship.<p><b>and do His will</b><br>Doing God's will is a central tenet of biblical teaching, reflecting obedience and submission to God's commands. This phrase calls the Israelites to align their actions with God's desires, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a>, where God outlines what He requires of His people. The call to action here is not just about avoiding sin but actively pursuing righteousness and living according to God's statutes. This aligns with the New Testament teaching in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which urges believers to be doers of the word, not merely hearers.<p><b>Separate yourselves from the people of the land</b><br>The command to separate from the people of the land highlights the need for holiness and purity among God's people. In the historical context, the Israelites were surrounded by pagan nations whose practices and beliefs were contrary to God's laws. This separation is not about ethnic superiority but about maintaining spiritual integrity and avoiding idolatry, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>. The call for separation is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are urged to be in the world but not of it (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>).<p><b>and from your foreign wives.</b><br>This directive addresses the specific issue of intermarriage with foreign women, which was leading the Israelites away from their covenant with God. Marriages to foreign wives often resulted in the introduction of idolatry and pagan practices, as seen in the story of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>). The command to separate from foreign wives is a call to return to covenant faithfulness and prevent the dilution of religious and cultural identity. This theme of spiritual fidelity is mirrored in the New Testament, where believers are cautioned against being unequally yoked with unbelievers (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem.
