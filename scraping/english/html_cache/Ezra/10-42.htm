In the context of <a href="/ezra/10.htm">Ezra 10</a>, Shallum is one of the Israelites who had taken foreign wives, which was against the Mosaic Law. This highlights the recurring theme of Israel's struggle to maintain purity and obedience to God's commandments. The name Shallum means "retribution" or "recompense," which may reflect the consequences faced by those who disobeyed God's laws. This situation underscores the importance of covenant faithfulness, a central theme throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Amariah</b><br>Amariah, meaning "Yahweh has promised," is another name that appears frequently in the Old Testament, often associated with priests or Levites. The inclusion of Amariah in this list suggests a broader issue within the community, where even those who were supposed to lead in spiritual matters had fallen into disobedience. This reflects the pervasive nature of sin and the need for communal repentance and reform. The presence of Amariah in this context serves as a reminder of the need for spiritual leaders to uphold and model adherence to God's laws.<p><b>Joseph</b><br>Joseph, a name meaning "He will add," is historically significant in Israel's history, most notably as the name of one of the patriarchs, the son of Jacob. In the context of <a href="/ezra/10.htm">Ezra 10</a>, Joseph is listed among those who had taken foreign wives, indicating a breach of the covenant. This highlights the ongoing challenge of maintaining distinctiveness as God's chosen people amidst surrounding cultures. The name Joseph also evokes themes of redemption and provision, as seen in the story of Joseph in Genesis, who was used by God to preserve his family. This connection may serve as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the potential for restoration even after failure.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shallum.htm">Shallum</a></b><br>A name that appears multiple times in the Bible, often associated with individuals who played roles in various events.
