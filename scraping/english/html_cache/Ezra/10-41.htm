The name means "God has helped," which reflects a common theme in Hebrew names where the character or destiny of a person is tied to their relationship with God. In the context of <a href="/ezra/10.htm">Ezra 10</a>, Azarel is listed among those who had taken foreign wives, which was against the Mosaic Law. This highlights the ongoing struggle of the Israelites to maintain their distinct identity and covenant relationship with God amidst surrounding pagan cultures. The call to separate from foreign influences is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing the need for holiness and purity in worship.<p><b>Shelemiah</b><br>Shelemiah is another name that appears multiple times in the Old Testament, often associated with priestly or Levitical duties. The name means "God has repaid" or "God is peace," indicating a divine recompense or tranquility. In <a href="/ezra/10.htm">Ezra 10</a>, Shelemiah is listed among those who had intermarried with foreign women, which was a significant issue for the post-exilic community striving to reestablish their identity and faithfulness to God's commandments. This reflects the broader narrative of Israel's history, where obedience to God's law was crucial for receiving His blessings and maintaining peace within the community. The inclusion of Shelemiah in this list underscores the importance of repentance and returning to God's ways.<p><b>Shemariah</b><br>Shemariah, meaning "God has kept" or "God guards," is a name that signifies divine protection and faithfulness. In the context of <a href="/ezra/10.htm">Ezra 10</a>, Shemariah is among those who had taken foreign wives, highlighting the challenge of remaining faithful to God's covenant in a diverse and often hostile cultural environment. This situation is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where the Israelites struggled with idolatry and assimilation into surrounding nations, leading to spiritual and social consequences. The call to separate from foreign influences and return to God's law is a theme that resonates throughout the Old Testament, pointing to the need for a faithful remnant who would uphold God's standards and prepare the way for the coming Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azarel.htm">Azarel</a></b><br>A member of the Israelite community who was involved in the issue of intermarriage with foreign women, which was against the Mosaic Law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shelemiah.htm">Shelemiah</a></b><br>Another individual listed among those who had taken foreign wives, highlighting the widespread nature of the problem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shemariah.htm">Shemariah</a></b><br>Also part of the group needing to repent and separate from foreign influences to restore covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' disobedience in marrying foreign women was a direct violation of God's commands.

Because Scripture is historically precise (see <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>), the Holy Spirit saw fit to preserve even this single name.<p>&#8226; The listing underscores that God deals with individuals as well as the nation. Like the earlier call to consecration in <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, each person had to choose obedience.<p>&#8226; Azarel&#8217;s presence in the record shows:<p>&#8211; Personal responsibility&#8212;no hiding in the crowd (compare <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>, &#8220;be sure your sin will find you out&#8221;).<p>&#8211; The opportunity for repentance&#8212;God&#8217;s mercy extended to every name on the list (see <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>; <a href="/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a>).<p>&#8226; His inclusion reminds believers today that acts of compromise are never anonymous before the Lord (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>), yet confession restores fellowship (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shelemiah</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Shelemiah&#8221; follows, another man of the same situation. His name appears in other contexts (e.g., <a href="/nehemiah/13-13.htm">Nehemiah 13:13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a>), showing that even common names can mark uncommon obedience or disobedience.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/bsb/ezra/10.htm">Ezra 10</a> Shelemiah models:<p>&#8211; Submission to scriptural authority.
