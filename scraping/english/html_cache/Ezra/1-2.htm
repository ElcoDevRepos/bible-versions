His decree marks a significant moment in biblical history, as it allowed the Jewish exiles to return to Jerusalem. This aligns with historical records, such as the Cyrus Cylinder, which corroborates his policy of repatriation and religious tolerance. Cyrus is seen as a pivotal figure used by God to fulfill His purposes, despite being a pagan king.<p><b>&#8216;The LORD, the God of heaven,</b><br>The title "God of heaven" emphasizes God's sovereignty and supreme authority over all creation, a concept that would resonate with both Jews and Persians. This title is used frequently in post-exilic texts, reflecting the influence of Persian culture and the acknowledgment of a supreme deity. It underscores the belief that God is not limited to the land of Israel but rules over all nations.<p><b>who has given me all the kingdoms of the earth,</b><br>Cyrus acknowledges that his vast empire is a result of divine providence. This reflects the biblical theme that God is the ultimate authority over all earthly rulers and kingdoms. It echoes the message found in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God is described as the one who "removes kings and sets up kings." This acknowledgment by Cyrus serves as a reminder of God's control over history.<p><b>has appointed me to build a house for Him</b><br>Cyrus's decree to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, where God declares that Cyrus will say of Jerusalem, "Let it be rebuilt," and of the temple, "Let its foundations be laid." This act of rebuilding the temple is a type of Christ, as Jesus later refers to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), symbolizing the restoration of true worship through Him.<p><b>at Jerusalem in Judah.</b><br>Jerusalem holds a central place in Jewish identity and worship, being the location of the original temple built by Solomon. The return to Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the temple signify the restoration of the Jewish community and their covenant relationship with God. This geographical focus highlights the fulfillment of God's promises to His people, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>, where God promises to bring the exiles back after seventy years.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cyrus_king_of_persia.htm">Cyrus King of Persia</a></b><br>The ruler of the Persian Empire who conquered Babylon and issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple.

The mention of the "kingdoms of the earth" is appropriate, since Cyrus had not inherited his empire, but built it up by the conquest of a vast number of independent states ('Herod.' 1. <span class="accented">passim</span>). His earn feeling that God had in all cases given him the victory harmonizes with the statement of Isaiah in <a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">hath charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem</span>. The <span class="accented">he</span> is emphatic, and is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in the Septuagint and <span class="accented">ipse</span> in the Vulgate. He himself, Jehovah-Elohim, has given it me in charge to build him a house. Most critics rightly explain by referring to <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, and accepting the statement of Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:1) that the passage was shown to Cyrus shortly after his capture of Babylon. He understood the prophecy as a command, and proceeded to obey it. <span class="cmt_word">Which is in Judah</span>. The addition of this clause marks strongly the oblivion into which the ruined city had fallen. Apparently, it was necessary, to recall its situation to men's minds by an express mention of the province whereof it had been the capital. Note the repetition of the clause in the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Cyrus</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1434;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;&#183;re&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3566.htm">Strong's 3566: </a> </span><span class="str2">Cyrus -- a person king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Persia</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1428;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;ras)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6539.htm">Strong's 6539: </a> </span><span class="str2">Persia -- a country in west Asia which conquered Babylon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;The LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of heaven,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;m&#257;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
