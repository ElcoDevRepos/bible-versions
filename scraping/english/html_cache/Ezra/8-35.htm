Nothing was held back.<p>- By choosing this type of sacrifice, the community acknowledges God&#8217;s complete ownership of their lives, much like <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> calls believers to present themselves as living sacrifices.<p>- Ezra had carried royal permission and resources specifically for temple worship (<a href="/ezra/7-17.htm">Ezra 7:17</a>), and here he deploys them exactly as intended.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>12 bulls for all Israel</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;twelve bulls for all Israel&#8230;&#8221;<p>- The number twelve points to the entirety of the covenant nation&#8212;each bull representing one tribe (<a href="/1_kings/18-31.htm">1 Kings 18:31</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-87.htm">Numbers 7:87-88</a>).<p>- Although only remnants from Judah and Benjamin had returned, the offering testifies that God still sees His people as one united Israel (<a href="/ezekiel/37-15.htm">Ezekiel 37:15-22</a>).<p>- Bulls, the largest sacrificial animals, underscore the magnitude of gratitude.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>96 rams</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;ninety-six rams&#8230;&#8221;<p>- Ninety-six is eight groups of twelve, reinforcing the theme of completeness and tribal representation.<p>- Rams were regular components of festival offerings (<a href="/numbers/29-13.htm">Numbers 29:13-36</a>) and ordination rites (<a href="/leviticus/8-18.htm">Leviticus 8:18-21</a>).<p>- Their inclusion proclaims that worship is not minimalist; it is marked by abundance in response to divine mercy (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-28.htm">2 Chronicles 29:28-32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>77 lambs</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;seventy-seven lambs&#8230;&#8221;<p>- The double seven speaks of perfect fullness (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). Seventy-seven intensifies that completeness (<a href="/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-22.htm">Matthew 18:22</a>).<p>- Lambs highlight innocence and substitution, pointing forward to the ultimate &#8220;Lamb of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p>- Together with the rams and bulls, the lambs form a crescendo of praise&#8212;large, medium, and small animals, all consumed for God alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>12 male goats as a sin offering</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and a sin offering of twelve male goats&#8230;&#8221;<p>- Goats served specifically for sin offerings (<a href="/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23-28</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-24.htm">Numbers 15:24-26</a>).<p>- Again, twelve stresses unified confession for the whole nation. No tribe is exempt from guilt, and none is excluded from forgiveness.<p>- This sacrifice balances the burnt offerings: devotion is matched by atonement, reminding worshipers that fellowship with God requires both surrender and cleansing (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All this was a burnt offering to the LORD</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;all as a burnt offering to the LORD.&#8221;<p>- Although separate animals are listed, the verse concludes with a singular focus: the entire act rises as one comprehensive gift to Yahweh (<a href="/psalms/51-19.htm">Psalm 51:19</a>).<p>- The wording stresses that every element belonged to Him; nothing was diverted for personal use.<p>- Such wholehearted worship anticipates the finished work of Christ, who &#8220;offered Himself unblemished to God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>) and thus fulfilled every sacrifice once for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a> records a watershed of returned exiles expressing complete gratitude and confession through carefully counted sacrifices. Each number carries covenant meaning&#8212;twelve for all Israel, multiples of twelve for completeness, and seventy-seven for perfected fullness. By combining burnt offerings with a sin offering, the people declare both their total dedication and their need for atonement. The scene showcases God&#8217;s faithfulness to restore, and His people&#8217;s fitting response: lavish, unified, and God-centered worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also the children of</span> <span class="cmt_word">those who had been carried away.</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the newly-returned exiles.

The classes of animals offered are the same on the two occasions, and the number of the he-goats is identical; but in every other case the victims are far less numerous now than on the former occasion. This is fully accounted for by the comparatively small number of those who returned under Ezra. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/8-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the exiles</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who had returned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1440;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;b&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
