Young bulls, rams, and lambs were commonly used in burnt offerings, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>. These offerings symbolized atonement and dedication to God. The mention of "the God of heaven" underscores the recognition of God's sovereignty and aligns with the post-exilic emphasis on monotheism. This provision reflects the Persian king's respect for the Jewish faith and his desire to support their religious practices.<p><b>as well as wheat, salt, wine, and oil</b><br>These items were essential for the grain offerings and drink offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings, as described in <a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2</a> and <a href="/numbers/15.htm">Numbers 15</a>. Wheat was used for grain offerings, symbolizing sustenance and thanksgiving. Salt was a covenantal symbol, representing purity and preservation (<a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>). Wine was used in drink offerings, signifying joy and celebration (<a href="/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5-10</a>).

Daily offerings were a crucial aspect of the temple worship, as seen in <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>, where daily sacrifices were commanded. This regular provision ensured that the worship of God continued uninterrupted, highlighting the importance of faithfulness in religious duties.

The only other ordinary sacrificial animal was "a kid of the goats<span class="cmt_word">." Wheat, salt, wine, and oil</span> were needed for the "meat offerings" by which every burnt offering was accompanied (<a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40, 41</a>; <a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Let it be given them day by day</span>. Since sacrifice was offered every day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/6-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Whatever</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
