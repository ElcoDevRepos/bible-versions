This aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, where Cyrus is named as the one who will decree the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple. His decree marks the fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecy (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>) regarding the end of the Babylonian exile after seventy years.<p><b>he issued a decree concerning the house of God in Jerusalem</b><br>The decree was a significant political and religious act, as it allowed the Jewish exiles to return and rebuild the temple, central to their worship and identity. This decree is recorded in <a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a> and reflects the Persian policy of supporting local religions to maintain control over their vast empire. The "house of God" refers to the temple, which had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC.<p><b>Let the house be rebuilt as a place for offering sacrifices</b><br>The primary function of the temple was to serve as a place for sacrifices, which were central to the Jewish faith and covenant relationship with God. Sacrifices were a means of atonement and worship, as outlined in Levitical law (Leviticus 1-7). The rebuilding of the temple was essential for restoring proper worship and religious practices.<p><b>and let its foundations be firmly laid</b><br>The emphasis on firm foundations indicates the importance of stability and permanence in the construction of the temple. This can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual foundation of the Jewish people, as well as a literal instruction for the builders. The laying of the foundation was a significant event, celebrated with joy and worship (<a href="/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10-13</a>).<p><b>It is to be sixty cubits high and sixty cubits wide</b><br>The dimensions of the temple, sixty cubits high and wide, suggest a grand and imposing structure, though smaller than Solomon's original temple. A cubit is approximately 18 inches, making the temple about 90 feet in both height and width. These dimensions reflect the temple's importance and the resources available under Persian patronage. The temple's design and measurements also have symbolic significance, representing God's majesty and the order of creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_cyrus.htm">King Cyrus</a></b><br>The Persian king who issued the decree to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem.

In a single sentence, the verse sets the moment (first year of Cyrus), the mission (rebuild the temple), the motive (renewed sacrifices), the means (secure foundations), and the magnitude (sixty by sixty cubits). Each phrase threads Old Testament prophecy with future hope, showing a God who keeps His word exactly, inspires worship centrally, and builds securely for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Strongly laid.</span>--"Thy foundation shall be laid" (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm" title="That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.">Isaiah 44:28</a>). The decree adds a word that signifies "with sufficient support."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifice.</span> Or, "the place where they may offer sacrifice." It is the future, rather than the past, which Cyrus is contemplating. <span class="cmt_word">Let the foundation thereof be strongly laid</span>. Isaiah had prophesied that Cyrus should "say to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, <span class="accented">Thy foundation shall be laid"</span> (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). Cyrus adds an injunction that the foundations be laid "supportingly," or "strongly," that so the house may the longer continue. <span class="cmt_word">The height thereof threescore cubits.</span> Half the height of the first temple, according to the existing text of Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>); but one-third <span class="accented">more</span> than the previous height, as estimated by the author of Kings (<a href="/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the breadth thereof threescore cubits.</span> This breadth is thrice that of the main building, according to both Chronicles and Kings. It is even double that of the old temple, <span class="accented">with the side chambers</span>, which occupied a space of five cubits, or seven and a half feet, on either wing. That such an enlargement actually took effect would seem to be most improbable; and we may perhaps conclude that Cyrus designed a building on a grander scale than Zerubbabel, with the resources at his disposal, was able to erect. It is curious that Cyrus did not in his decree specify the length of the temple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the first</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1491;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2298.htm">Strong's 2298: </a> </span><span class="str2">As card, one, single, first, at once</span><br /><br /><span class="word">year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1448;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#353;&#183;na&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
