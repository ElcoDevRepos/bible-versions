The time referred to is during the reign of King Darius of Persia, around 520 BC. This was a period when the Jewish exiles had returned to Jerusalem and were in the process of rebuilding the temple, which had been destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC.<p><b>Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates</b><br>Tattenai was a Persian official, likely appointed by King Darius, overseeing the province known as "Beyond the River," which included the land of Judah. His role as governor indicates the Persian Empire's administrative structure, which allowed local governance under the overarching control of the empire. This reflects the geopolitical landscape of the time, where the Persian Empire was vast and required local governors to manage different regions.<p><b>Shethar-bozenai, and their associates</b><br>Shethar-bozenai is mentioned alongside Tattenai, suggesting he was a subordinate or colleague in the administration. The mention of "their associates" implies a group of officials or advisors who were involved in the governance and oversight of the region. This highlights the bureaucratic nature of the Persian administration.<p><b>went to the Jews and asked</b><br>This action indicates a formal inquiry or investigation. The Jews, having returned from exile, were engaged in rebuilding efforts, which were of interest to the local authorities. The approach of Tattenai and his associates suggests a level of concern or suspicion about the activities of the Jews, possibly due to political or social implications.<p><b>&#8220;Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?&#8221;</b><br>The question posed by Tattenai and his associates is central to the narrative. It reflects the legal and political challenges faced by the Jews during the reconstruction. The inquiry about authorization points to the importance of imperial decrees in the Persian Empire. This question also connects to earlier decrees by Cyrus the Great, who initially allowed the Jews to return and rebuild (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). The rebuilding of the temple is significant in biblical prophecy and typology, as the temple is a symbol of God's presence among His people and foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tattenai.htm">Tattenai</a></b><br>- The governor of the region beyond the River, who questioned the Jews about their authority to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shethar-bozenai.htm">Shethar-bozenai</a></b><br>- An official who accompanied Tattenai in questioning the Jews.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews_in_jerusalem.htm">The Jews in Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The group of exiles who had returned to Jerusalem and were rebuilding the temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The central place of worship for the Jewish people, which was being rebuilt after the Babylonian exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_province_beyond_the_river.htm">The Province Beyond the River</a></b><br>- A Persian administrative region that included Judah and Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_and_obedience.htm">Authority and Obedience</a></b><br>The Jews were questioned about their authority to rebuild the temple.

The etymology is uncertain, but seems not to be Semitic (see Pusey's 'Daniel,' pp. 570-572). The respective rank of Tatnai and Zerub-babel is indicated, not by this term, but by what follows it.
