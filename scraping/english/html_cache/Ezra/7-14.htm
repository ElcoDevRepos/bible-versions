The number seven is significant in Persian culture, often representing completeness or perfection, and the seven counselors could be akin to a royal council. This reflects the Persian administrative system and the king's trust in Ezra. The sending of Ezra by the king underscores the political and diplomatic backing for his mission, which was crucial for the success of his religious and social reforms in Judah.<p><b>to evaluate Judah and Jerusalem</b><br>Ezra's mission was to assess the spiritual and social conditions of the Jewish community in Judah and Jerusalem. This evaluation was necessary because the Jewish exiles had returned from Babylon, and there was a need to re-establish religious practices and adherence to the Law. Jerusalem, as the spiritual center, was particularly significant. The evaluation would involve ensuring that the people were living according to the covenant and that the temple services were being properly conducted.<p><b>according to the Law of your God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the centrality of the Torah, or the Law of Moses, in Ezra's mission. Ezra was a scribe skilled in the Law, and his task was to ensure that the Jewish community was living in accordance with God's commandments. This reflects the post-exilic emphasis on the Law as the foundation of Jewish identity and religious practice. The Law served as the standard by which the community's faithfulness to God was measured.<p><b>which is in your hand</b><br>The phrase indicates that Ezra had a physical copy of the Law, which was a rare and precious possession at the time. This underscores Ezra's role as a scribe and teacher, responsible for interpreting and teaching the Law to the people. The possession of the Law "in your hand" signifies both authority and responsibility, as Ezra was to guide the community in understanding and applying God's commandments. This also foreshadows the later development of the synagogue and the role of the scribe in Jewish life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest, Ezra is a central figure in the restoration of Jerusalem and the Jewish community after the Babylonian exile.

They are commonly identified with the "seven princes of Persia and Media," mentioned in Esther (<a href="/esther/1-14.htm">Esther 1:14</a>), "which saw the king's face," and "sate first in the kingdom." A conjecture, which, though not unreasonable, cannot be said to be substantiated, connects the "seven counsellors" with the seven great Persian septs, or families, which had privileges beyond the rest, and among them the right of unrestricted access to the royal presence ('Herod.,' 3:84). The commission which Ezra received is described in this verse as one <span class="cmt_word">to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem;</span> but the subject-matter of the inquiry is not mentioned. He can scarcely have been sent to make inquiry whether the law of Moses was observed or no, since that was certainly not a matter with which the Persian government would concern itself. Probably he was to inquire generally into the material prosperity of the province, and to report thereon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/7-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You are sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#238;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7972.htm">Strong's 7972: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4481.htm">Strong's 4481: </a> </span><span class="str2">From, out of, by, by reason of, at, more than</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his seven</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1444;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;i&#7687;&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
