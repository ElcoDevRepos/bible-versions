Their origins trace back to the Gibeonites, who were made servants to the Israelites (<a href="/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>). The number 220 signifies a substantial group, indicating the importance of their role in temple service. This reflects the organized structure of worship and the need for dedicated personnel in maintaining the temple's operations.<p><b>all designated by name</b><br>The mention of being "designated by name" underscores the importance of each individual's role and the careful record-keeping practiced by the Israelites. This practice ensured accountability and recognition of service, reflecting the value placed on each person's contribution to the community. It also highlights the personal nature of service to God, where each person is known and valued.<p><b>David and the officials had appointed them</b><br>King David, along with his officials, established the roles and duties of the temple servants.

This assistance was necessary due to the extensive responsibilities of the Levites, which included teaching the law, performing sacrifices, and maintaining the temple. The collaboration between the Levites and the temple servants illustrates the communal effort required in worship and the division of labor that allowed the temple to function efficiently. This structure can be seen as a type of the body of Christ, where different members have different roles but work together for the common purpose of glorifying God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led a group of exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.
