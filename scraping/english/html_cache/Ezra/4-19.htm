The decree to search the archives demonstrates the administrative organization of the Persian Empire, which maintained records of past events and decrees. This action underscores the importance of historical records in decision-making processes. The search for records is reminiscent of other biblical instances where records played a crucial role, such as in the book of Esther, where the king's sleepless night led to the discovery of Mordecai's unrewarded loyalty (<a href="/esther/6.htm">Esther 6:1-3</a>).<p><b>It was discovered that this city has revolted against kings from ancient times,</b><br>The city in question is Jerusalem, which had a history of rebellion against foreign rulers. This historical context is significant, as Jerusalem had previously resisted Babylonian and Assyrian control, leading to its destruction and the exile of its people. The phrase "from ancient times" highlights the longstanding nature of Jerusalem's resistance, which can be traced back to the divided monarchy and the various conflicts with surrounding nations. This history of rebellion is documented in books like 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles, where the actions of kings such as Hezekiah and Zedekiah are recorded.<p><b>engaging in rebellion and sedition.</b><br>Rebellion and sedition were serious charges in the ancient world, often leading to severe consequences for the accused city or people. In the context of the Persian Empire, maintaining order and loyalty was crucial for the stability of the vast territories under its control. The accusation of rebellion aligns with the historical accounts of Jerusalem's resistance to foreign domination, as seen in the opposition to Babylonian rule (<a href="/2_kings/24-20.htm">2 Kings 24:20</a>) and the eventual fall of the city. This phrase also foreshadows the challenges faced by the returning exiles in rebuilding Jerusalem, as they encountered opposition from surrounding peoples who viewed them as a potential threat to regional stability.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_artaxerxes.htm">King Artaxerxes</a></b><br>The Persian king who issued the decree to halt the rebuilding of Jerusalem.

Royal decrees in Persia were irrevocable (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a>) and carried the full weight of the throne. By allowing the search, God is working through human government (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>) to move the narrative forward&#8212;even when that government is pagan. The decree underlines how seriously the empire treated any potential threat and reminds us that earthly rulers, knowingly or not, operate under God&#8217;s overarching sovereignty (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A search was conducted</b><p>Persian archives were vast, kept in fortified treasuries like Ecbatana and Babylon (<a href="/ezra/6-1.htm">Ezra 6:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1</a>). The meticulous search demonstrates due diligence; the king refuses to act on rumor. This detail reinforces the biblical principle that a matter should be established by a careful investigation (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). God can even use bureaucratic processes to accomplish His larger purposes, proving once again that &#8220;the plans of the LORD stand firm forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It was discovered</b><p>The records confirm the accusation, giving the king what he sees as solid evidence. Nothing stays hidden from the Lord (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>; <a href="/luke/8-17.htm">Luke 8:17</a>), and here human paperwork uncovers Jerusalem&#8217;s turbulent past. The discovery also exposes the city&#8217;s long-standing tension with foreign rule, a fact that will shape Persia&#8217;s decision. From a faith perspective, God uses this discovery to set the stage for later triumph, just as He later uses Darius&#8217;s decree to advance the rebuilding (<a href="/ezra/6-7.htm">Ezra 6:7&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This city has revolted against kings from ancient times</b><p>The archives likely held reports of:<p>&#8226; Hezekiah resisting Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>)<p>&#8226; Jehoiakim rebelling against Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>)<p>&#8226; Zedekiah&#8217;s oath-breaking before Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>)<p>These episodes paint Jerusalem as a persistent rebel. From the king&#8217;s vantage point, the city&#8217;s history justifies caution. Yet for believers, those same &#8220;rebellions&#8221; often sprang from fidelity to God over pagan overlords (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>). The tension highlights the cost of covenant loyalty in a fallen world.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Engaging in rebellion and sedition</b><p>&#8220;Rebellion&#8221; targets the throne; &#8220;sedition&#8221; stirs the populace. The charges echo accusations later leveled against Paul (<a href="/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>) and even Jesus (<a href="/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>). The wording shows how spiritual allegiance to God can be misconstrued as civil insurrection. While the empire frames the issue politically, the deeper conflict is spiritual&#8212;who will rule Jerusalem, earthly kings or the LORD? God allows the work to pause (<a href="/ezra/4-23.htm">Ezra 4:23&#8211;24</a>) so that, in His perfect timing, He can receive greater glory when construction resumes under Darius (<a href="/ezra/6-14.htm">Ezra 6:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/4-19.htm">Ezra 4:19</a> records a pagan king&#8217;s official conclusion after a thorough archival search: Jerusalem has a long reputation for resisting foreign rule, and that history appears to validate the enemies&#8217; complaint. The verse reveals the seriousness of royal decrees, the thoroughness of Persian administration, the city&#8217;s turbulent past, and the ever-present tension between earthly and divine authority. Even in a governmental setback, God is quietly orchestrating events that will ultimately further His unbreakable plan to restore His people and His house.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Insurrection.</span>--Never against Persia; but such as are alluded to in 2 Kings 24<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I commanded, and search has been made</span>. The Pseudo-Smerdis, who was a fanatical adherent of Magism, which disallowed temples altogether (Herod., 1:130), and who had already destroyed the temples of Ormuzd in Persia ('Behistun Ins.,' col. 1. par. 14, 5), was naturally willing enough to do as the Samaritans desired, and stop the restoration of the Jewish temple. Accordingly, he had a search made among the state records, and found, as they had expected he would, evidence of insurrections on the part of the Jews against the foreign countries to which they had been subject, as Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>) and Babylon (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 24:1; <a href="/jeremiah/52-3.htm">Jeremiah 52:3</a>), and also proof of the formidable power possessed by certain Jewish or Israelite kings; upon which he thought himself justified in complying with the Samaritan request, and ordering the work that was going on at Jerusalem to cease (see ver. 21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/4-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I issued</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7761.htm">Strong's 7761: </a> </span><span class="str2">To set, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a decree,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1501;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2942.htm">Strong's 2942: </a> </span><span class="str2">Flavor, judgment, account</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and a search was conducted.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;aq&#183;qa&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
