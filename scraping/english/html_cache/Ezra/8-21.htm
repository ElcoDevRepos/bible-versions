This location signifies a place of preparation and spiritual readiness. The canal's mention highlights the historical context of the Babylonian exile and the return under Persian rule, emphasizing the physical and spiritual journey of the Israelites.<p><b>I proclaimed a fast</b><br>Fasting in the Old Testament is often associated with repentance, seeking God's guidance, or preparing for a significant event. Ezra's proclamation of a fast underscores the seriousness of their mission and the need for divine intervention. It reflects a common biblical practice where fasting is used to humble oneself and seek God's favor, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12</a> and <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>.<p><b>so that we might humble ourselves before our God</b><br>Humility before God is a recurring theme in the Bible, emphasizing the need for dependence on divine strength rather than human ability. This act of humbling is a recognition of God's sovereignty and a plea for His mercy and guidance. It aligns with teachings in <a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a> and <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>, which highlight the importance of humility in receiving God's grace.<p><b>and ask Him for a safe journey</b><br>The request for a safe journey reflects the dangers and uncertainties of travel in ancient times, especially for a large group carrying valuable items. This plea for protection is a demonstration of faith in God's providence and echoes other biblical instances where God's protection is sought, such as in <a href="/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a>.<p><b>for us and our children</b><br>Including children in the prayer for safety highlights the communal aspect of the journey and the continuity of faith across generations. It underscores the importance of family and community in the covenant relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>, where the faith is to be passed down to children.<p><b>with all our possessions</b><br>The mention of possessions indicates the practical concerns of the journey, as they were transporting valuable items for the temple in Jerusalem. It reflects the stewardship of resources dedicated to God's service and the need for divine protection over material blessings, similar to the protection sought in <a href="/nehemiah/2-7.htm">Nehemiah 2:7-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.

Much like the Red Sea camp (<a href="/exodus/14-2.htm">Exodus 14:2-3</a>) or the banks of the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/3-1.htm">Joshua 3:1</a>), this waypoint becomes a place of spiritual preparation, not merely logistical organization. God&#8217;s people often meet Him in seemingly ordinary settings that become holy ground when they stop to seek His face.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I proclaimed a fast</b><p>Ezra, as priest-scribe, calls everyone to abstain from food. In Scripture, corporate fasting is a God-ordained means of aligning hearts with His purposes (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3</a>; <a href="/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>). It is not an empty ritual but a tangible confession that sustenance and success come from the Lord, not from human strength. In that spirit, the travelers set aside physical appetites to focus on spiritual dependence.<p>&#8226; Fasting highlights urgency (<a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Fasting expresses repentance and faith (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Fasting invites divine intervention (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that we might humble ourselves before our God</b><p>Humility is the declared goal of the fast. Scripture promises that God &#8220;opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). By bowing low, the exiles acknowledge their unworthiness and God&#8217;s sufficiency. This mirrors the covenant pattern: confession precedes deliverance (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). True humility looks upward in worship and inward in repentance, trusting the Lord to exalt in due time (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and ask Him for a safe journey</b><p>Traveling 900 miles across desert and hostile territories with families and temple treasures demanded divine protection.

The psalmist assures, &#8220;The LORD will guard your coming and going, both now and forevermore&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a>). Prayer converts anxiety into petition, casting every care on the One who cares (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for us and our children, with all our possessions</b><p>Ezra&#8217;s prayer covers every sphere&#8212;people, families, resources.

By including children and possessions, Ezra models comprehensive stewardship: everything entrusted to the pilgrims belongs to the Lord (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>), and everything needs His safeguarding (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21</a> reveals a timeless pattern: pause in the journey, fast to express total dependence, humble yourself before God, and boldly ask for His protection over every aspect of life.
