This reflects the seriousness of the call to repentance and reform. The swift response indicates the people's recognition of the gravity of their sin and the need for immediate action. This urgency can be compared to other instances in Scripture where quick action was necessary, such as Jonah's call to Nineveh.<p><b>all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled in Jerusalem</b><br>Judah and Benjamin were the two tribes that made up the Southern Kingdom of Judah. Their assembly in Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center, underscores the importance of the issue at hand. Jerusalem, being the location of the Temple, was the appropriate place for addressing matters of covenant faithfulness. This gathering echoes the unity seen in other biblical convocations, such as the assembly at Mount Sinai.<p><b>and on the twentieth day of the ninth month</b><br>The ninth month corresponds to Kislev in the Hebrew calendar, which falls around November-December. This timing is significant as it is the rainy season in Israel, adding a layer of difficulty to the assembly. The specific date marks a historical moment of communal repentance and decision-making, similar to other significant dates in Israel's history, such as the Day of Atonement.<p><b>all the people sat in the square at the house of God</b><br>The square at the house of God refers to the open area near the Temple, a central place for public gatherings and proclamations. This setting emphasizes the communal nature of the repentance and the public acknowledgment of sin. The Temple's proximity highlights the religious significance of the event, as the people sought to restore their covenant relationship with God.<p><b>trembling regarding this matter</b><br>The trembling indicates a deep sense of fear and reverence, recognizing the seriousness of their disobedience to God's law. This emotional response is akin to the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). It reflects a genuine acknowledgment of guilt and the potential consequences of their actions.<p><b>and because of the heavy rain</b><br>The heavy rain during the assembly adds a physical discomfort to the spiritual weight of the situation. The rain, typical of the season, serves as a reminder of God's control over nature and the blessings and curses associated with covenant obedience (Deuteronomy 28). The adverse weather conditions underscore the people's commitment to repentance despite the challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem.

ADDRESS OF EZRA, AND CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE TO PUT AWAY THE STRANGE WIVES (vers. 10- 14). Hitherto Ezra seems to have allowed the leading part in the matter to be taken by the civil authorities, whom he had found established in Jerusalem on his arrival (<a href="/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1-8</a>). Now he came forward boldly, denouncing the sin committed, and as supreme governor commanding the repudiation of the strange wives. The assembled multitude consented, but urged that the matter required time; that the season was unsuitable for a prolonged stay of the whole body of country Jews at Jerusalem, and that the business would be most conveniently carried through by a standing commission consisting of the chief authorities of the city of Jerusalem, who should take the case of each country town separately, and, in conjunction with the elders and judges of each town, investigate the alleged mixed marriages of each locality, and adjudicate upon them. By this arrangement the bulk of the country Jews would be allowed at once to return home; and the case of each locality being taken separately, only a small number would at any given time be suffering the inconvenience of a compulsory absence from their residences, and the expense of a stay of some duration in the capital. The proposal was reasonable, and it appears to have approved itself to Ezra and his advisers, and to have been at once adopted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/10-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So within the three</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#353;&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
