Gold bowls were often used in religious rituals and offerings, signifying purity and holiness. The valuation of these bowls at "1,000 darics" provides insight into the economic context of the time. The daric was a gold coin used in the Persian Empire, indicating the influence of Persian culture and economy on the Jewish people during the post-exilic period. This reflects the historical setting of Ezra, where the Jewish exiles were returning from Babylonian captivity under Persian rule. The provision of such valuable items underscores the importance of restoring the temple worship in Jerusalem.<p><b>and two articles of fine polished bronze</b><br>The "two articles of fine polished bronze" suggest items of significant craftsmanship and value. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, was commonly used in ancient times for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The polishing of these articles indicates a high level of artistry and care, reflecting the dedication to the temple's beauty and function. In the broader biblical context, bronze is often associated with judgment and strength, as seen in the bronze altar and the bronze serpent in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>). These articles may symbolize the enduring strength and resilience of the Jewish faith and community.<p><b>as precious as gold</b><br>The phrase "as precious as gold" elevates the value of the bronze articles to that of gold, emphasizing their importance and worth. This comparison highlights the reverence and esteem for the temple's furnishings, regardless of the material. In biblical symbolism, gold often represents divinity, purity, and kingship, as seen in the construction of the tabernacle and Solomon's temple. By equating the bronze articles with gold, the text underscores the sacredness of all contributions to the temple, reflecting the heart of worship and devotion. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as precious and invaluable, fulfilling the law and the prophets with His divine nature and sacrificial love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led a group of exiles from Babylon back to Jerusalem.

Their sheer number reminds us:<p>&#8226; God provided abundantly for restored worship, not sparingly (cf. <a href="/exodus/25-29.htm">Exodus 25:29</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48</a>).<p>&#8226; Gold vessels had formerly been plundered by Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>). Now the Lord turns captivity into blessing by sending new ones back (<a href="/ezra/1-7.htm">Ezra 1:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Their purpose was sacred service&#8212;bowls for offerings, sprinkling, and incense (<a href="/numbers/7-14.htm">Numbers 7:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>). Obedience in small details of worship matters to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>valued at 1,000 darics</b><p>&#8220;Valued at 1,000 darics&#8221; quantifies the gift. A daric was a Persian gold coin, so Ezra records a real monetary worth. This underscores:<p>&#8226; Integrity&#8212;Ezra publicly accounts for every item (<a href="/ezra/8-33.htm">Ezra 8:33-34</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-20.htm">2 Corinthians 8:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Sacrifice&#8212;the donors gave costly treasure, echoing David&#8217;s offering for the first temple (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-7.htm">1 Chronicles 29:7</a>) and the returning exiles&#8217; earlier gifts (<a href="/ezra/2-69.htm">Ezra 2:69</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people invest resources in His house because He first lavished grace on them (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7-11</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and two articles of fine polished bronze</b><p>Next come &#8220;two articles of fine polished bronze.&#8221; Bronze in Scripture often relates to judgment and strength (<a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>), yet here the emphasis is craftsmanship:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Fine&#8221; points to excellence. Only the best belongs in God&#8217;s sanctuary (<a href="/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Bronze utensils had been prominent in Solomon&#8217;s temple&#8212;pillars, altar, basins (<a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15-47</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/4-2.htm">2 Chronicles 4:2-5</a>). The rebuilt temple mirrors that legacy.<p>&#8226; Though only two pieces are mentioned, their inclusion shows that every contribution, great or small, is noted by the Lord (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as precious as gold</b><p>Finally, Ezra adds that the bronze articles were &#8220;as precious as gold.&#8221; Polished bronze could gleam like gold, but the phrase also conveys a spiritual truth:<p>&#8226; Value is defined by purpose&#8212;used for God, bronze becomes priceless (<a href="/2_timothy/2-20.htm">2 Timothy 2:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; God sees worth beyond material composition (<a href="/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>). What matters is consecration, not mere metal.<p>&#8226; The comparison elevates the entire offering, showing unified devotion: diverse gifts, equal honor (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/8-27.htm">Ezra 8:27</a> records specific, literal treasures carried from Babylon to Jerusalem: twenty gold bowls, 1,000-daric value, two polished-bronze items prized like gold. Each detail testifies that God faithfully restores what was lost, calls His people to excellence in worship, and regards every dedicated gift as precious. By painstakingly listing these vessels, Scripture affirms both the reliability of the historical account and the enduring principle that whatever we offer to the Lord&#8212;whether gold or polished bronze&#8212;becomes invaluable in His service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">A thousand drams.</span>--<span class= "ital">Darics,</span> and therefore the whole worth rather more than a thousand guineas.<p><span class= "bld">Fine copper.</span>--Probably the Roman Orichalcum, a metal very highly valued.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams</span> (see comment on Ezra 2:69).
