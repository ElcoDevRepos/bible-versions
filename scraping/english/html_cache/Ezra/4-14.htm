The Persian Empire was known for its vast bureaucracy and administrative efficiency. Being in the service of the palace implies a duty to uphold the interests of the king and the empire. This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Near Eastern societies, where loyalty to the king was paramount. The palace, as a symbol of royal authority, underscores the importance of their role in maintaining order and allegiance.<p><b>and it is not fitting for us to allow the king to be dishonored</b><br>The concept of honor and shame was central in ancient cultures, including the Persian Empire. Dishonoring the king would not only be a personal failure but could also have broader political implications. The king was seen as a divine or semi-divine figure, and maintaining his honor was crucial for the stability of the realm. This phrase suggests a deep sense of duty and the potential consequences of failing to protect the king's reputation. It also reflects the biblical theme of respecting authority, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>, which emphasizes submission to governing authorities.<p><b>we have sent to inform the king</b><br>This action demonstrates the protocol of communication within the empire. Sending a message to the king was a formal process, often involving written correspondence or envoys. The act of informing the king suggests a proactive approach to governance and the importance of keeping the monarch aware of potential threats or issues. This aligns with the biblical principle of accountability and transparency, as seen in other scriptural narratives where leaders are informed of significant events or challenges, such as in the story of Nehemiah, who also communicated with the Persian king regarding the rebuilding of Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_adversaries_of_judah_and_benjamin.htm">The Adversaries of Judah and Benjamin</a></b><br>These are the people who opposed the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem.

By stating this, the officials remind Artaxerxes that they benefit from his provision, much like Daniel and his friends who were assigned &#8220;a daily portion from the king&#8217;s provision&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/1-5.htm">Daniel 1:5</a>).<p>&#8211; Scripture often links salt with covenant faithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-5.htm">2 Chronicles 13:5</a>). The officials invoke that idea to present themselves as trustworthy servants.<p>&#8211; Nehemiah made a similar appeal to royal favor when he requested permission to rebuild Jerusalem (<a href="/nehemiah/2-1.htm">Nehemiah 2:1&#8211;5</a>). In both cases, those who relied on the king&#8217;s resources believed it required steadfast allegiance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and it is not fitting for us to see the king dishonored</b><p>&#8226; Their professed concern is the king&#8217;s honor, portraying their opposition to Jerusalem&#8217;s reconstruction as an act of loyalty rather than hostility.<p>&#8211; <a href="/proverbs/24-21.htm">Proverbs 24:21</a> urges, &#8220;Fear the LORD and the king.&#8221; They claim to be doing exactly that&#8212;protecting royal interests.<p>&#8211; In <a href="/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8&#8211;9</a>, Haman used a similar tactic, arguing that tolerating the Jews would &#8220;harm the king&#8217;s interests.&#8221; Such appeals often wrapped self-interest in the language of royal concern.<p>&#8211; The phrase also echoes <a href="/nehemiah/2-3.htm">Nehemiah 2:3</a>, where Nehemiah feared that Jerusalem&#8217;s desolation reflected poorly on the king who ruled it. Here, the officials invert the idea: rebuilding, they argue, would bring dishonor by fostering rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we have sent to inform the king</b><p>&#8226; Acting on their professed duty, they forward a formal warning.<p>&#8211; <a href="/ezra/4-11.htm">Ezra 4:11&#8211;16</a> records their full message, accusing the Jews of planning sedition and predicting that if the city and its walls are finished, &#8220;you will have no dominion beyond the River.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Similar accusations appear in <a href="/ezra/5-9.htm">Ezra 5:9&#8211;12</a>, when later officials question the resumed work and again appeal to the throne.<p>&#8211; The pattern fits <a href="/daniel/6-13.htm">Daniel 6:13</a>, where jealous officials report Daniel&#8217;s prayers to Darius, claiming concern for the king&#8217;s edict. In every case, opponents cloak their true motives under a veil of political loyalty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/4-14.htm">Ezra 4:14</a> is the opponents&#8217; declaration of loyalty that sets the tone for their entire accusation. By stressing that they partake of the king&#8217;s provisions, refuse to tolerate any slight to his honor, and therefore feel compelled to report Jerusalem&#8217;s progress, they frame themselves as faithful servants safeguarding the empire. In truth, their words are a calculated strategy to halt the rebuilding of the temple and city. The verse reveals how God&#8217;s people often face opposition masked as civic duty, yet the broader narrative shows that the Lord&#8217;s purposes ultimately prevail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Maintenance.</span>--more exactly, <span class= "ital">we eat the salt of the palace.</span> This seems to be a general expression for dependence on the king, whose dishonour or loss they profess themselves unwilling to behold.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have maintenance from the king's palace</span>.
