This seven-day festival is marked by the removal of leaven from homes, symbolizing the removal of sin and corruption. The joy experienced by the Israelites during this time reflects their gratitude for God's deliverance and provision. The observance of this feast after the completion of the temple signifies a renewal of covenant faithfulness and a return to proper worship practices.<p><b>because the LORD had made them joyful</b><br>The joy of the Israelites is attributed directly to the LORD, indicating divine intervention and blessing. This joy is not merely a human emotion but a spiritual state granted by God, reflecting His favor and presence among His people. The rebuilding of the temple and the successful observance of the feast are seen as acts of divine grace, reinforcing the idea that true joy comes from a relationship with God.<p><b>and turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them</b><br>The reference to the "king of Assyria" is historically intriguing, as the Assyrian Empire had long been replaced by the Babylonian and then the Persian Empires by the time of Ezra. This phrase likely refers to the Persian king, Darius, who ruled over the former Assyrian territories. God's ability to influence the heart of a foreign king underscores His sovereignty over all nations and rulers. This divine intervention echoes <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, which states that the king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, highlighting God's control over political affairs to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>to strengthen their hands in the work on the house of the God of Israel</b><br>The strengthening of their hands signifies empowerment and encouragement to complete the temple reconstruction. This phrase emphasizes the importance of divine support in accomplishing God's work. The "house of the God of Israel" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people. The successful completion of the temple is a fulfillment of prophecy and a testament to God's faithfulness in restoring His people after the Babylonian exile. This work also prefigures the ultimate temple, Jesus Christ, who embodies God's presence with humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The Jewish people who returned from Babylonian exile and were involved in the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast_of_unleavened_bread.htm">The Feast of Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Exodus from Egypt, celebrated with joy and gratitude.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who intervenes in the affairs of nations and individuals.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_assyria.htm">The King of Assyria</a></b><br>Likely referring to Darius I of Persia, who ruled over the former Assyrian territories and supported the rebuilding of the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_god.htm">The House of God</a></b><br>The temple in Jerusalem, central to Jewish worship and identity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_divine_intervention.htm">The Power of Divine Intervention</a></b><br>God can change the hearts of leaders and authorities to fulfill His purposes.

It has been generally supposed that Darius is personally meant here, and surprise has been expressed at his being called "king of <span class="accented">Assyria."</span> That title is never elsewhere given in Scripture to a king of Persia. Perhaps the writer's real intention in this place is to express in a general way the thankfulness of the Jews that God had turned, the hearts of their civil rulers, whether Assyrians, Babylonians, or Persians, from hostility to friendship, having replaced the bitter enmity of Sennacherib and Nebuchadnezzar by the hearty good-will of Cyrus and Darius. On this view, Assyria would represent merely the great power of Western Asia, and "the king" would not be Darius personally, but the lord of Western Asia in a more general way, who by God's goodness had become the permanent friend of Israel instead of her oppressor and enemy. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/6-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For seven</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;i&#7687;&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7651.htm">Strong's 7651: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seven, seven times, a week, an indefinite number</span><br /><br /><span class="word">days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they observed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1447;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
