These people were a mix of various ethnicities and religious practices, which often conflicted with the returning Jewish exiles' efforts to reestablish their distinct identity and worship of Yahweh. Historically, these groups had been relocated by the Assyrian Empire, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>, leading to tensions with the returning Jews.<p><b>set out to discourage the people of Judah</b><br>The opposition from the local inhabitants was a significant challenge for the returning exiles. This discouragement was not merely emotional but involved active efforts to hinder the rebuilding process. The discouragement can be seen as a tactic to prevent the reestablishment of a strong Jewish presence in the region, which could threaten the existing power dynamics. This opposition is a recurring theme in the post-exilic period, as seen in <a href="/nehemiah/4.htm">Nehemiah 4:1-3</a>, where similar tactics are used against the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls.<p><b>and make them afraid</b><br>Fear was a powerful tool used by the adversaries to halt the progress of the rebuilding efforts. This fear could have stemmed from threats of violence, political pressure, or economic sanctions. The use of fear is a common strategy of opposition throughout biblical history, as seen in the story of Nehemiah, where threats and intimidation were used to stop the work on the walls of Jerusalem (<a href="/nehemiah/6-9.htm">Nehemiah 6:9</a>). The fear also reflects the vulnerability of the returning exiles, who were still establishing themselves in a land that had been under foreign control for decades.<p><b>to build</b><br>The building referred to here is the reconstruction of the temple in Jerusalem, a central aspect of Jewish identity and worship. The temple's rebuilding was crucial for the restoration of proper worship and the fulfillment of prophecies concerning the return from exile, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>. The temple also serves as a type of Christ, foreshadowing Jesus as the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), where God's presence dwells among His people. The opposition to the building project can be seen as an attempt to thwart God's redemptive plan, which ultimately finds fulfillment in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/people_of_the_land.htm">People of the Land</a></b><br>These were the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin, likely the Samaritans and other groups who had settled in the region during the Babylonian exile.

Worship has been restored and the altar has been rebuilt (<a href="/ezra/3-1.htm">Ezra 3:1&#8211;6</a>), and the foundation of the temple has been laid amid great rejoicing (<a href="/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10&#8211;13</a>). The word &#8220;Then&#8221; signals that opposition arises precisely at the moment of spiritual progress&#8212;just as Moses faced Pharaoh after announcing God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1&#8211;2</a>) and as Nehemiah met ridicule the moment he began rebuilding Jerusalem&#8217;s wall (<a href="/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1&#8211;3</a>). Victory is quickly followed by testing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people of the land</b><p>This phrase identifies the local inhabitants&#8212;descendants of those nations the Assyrians had resettled in Samaria after Israel&#8217;s exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24&#8211;33</a>). Though they claimed to seek God (<a href="/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>), their worship was a blend of paganism and fragments of Israelite practice. Scripture presents them as adversaries, not allies, of the returning remnant, just as Abraham&#8217;s neighbors proved a threat rather than a help (<a href="/genesis/21-22.htm">Genesis 21:22&#8211;34</a>). Their lineage and loyalties were mixed; their hearts were not devoted to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>set out to discourage</b><p>The opposition was intentional and strategic. &#8220;They hired counselors against them to frustrate their plans&#8221; (<a href="/ezra/4-5.htm">Ezra 4:5</a>). Discouragement is a classic weapon:<p>&#8226; It drains resolve (<a href="/numbers/14-1.htm">Numbers 14:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; It distorts perspective (<a href="/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; It delays obedience (<a href="/haggai/1-2.htm">Haggai 1:2&#8211;4</a>).<p>Satan used the same tactic when he tempted Christ in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3&#8211;11</a>), seeking to undermine confidence in the Father&#8217;s plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people of Judah</b><p>These are the returned exiles&#8212;Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and their compatriots&#8212;who have embraced the privilege of rebuilding God&#8217;s house (<a href="/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1&#8211;2</a>). Although small in number and resources, they are God&#8217;s chosen instrument, much like Gideon&#8217;s reduced army (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>). Their assignment is noble; their vulnerability is obvious; their dependence on the Lord is essential (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and make them afraid</b><p>Fear intensifies discouragement. The adversaries employed threats, slander in royal court, and legal roadblocks (<a href="/ezra/4-6.htm">Ezra 4:6&#8211;23</a>). Fear paralyzes (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-8.htm">Deuteronomy 20:8</a>), but God continually commands His servants, &#8220;Do not be afraid&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). When fear is resisted, faith flourishes (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to build</b><p>The ultimate target was the work itself&#8212;God&#8217;s dwelling among His people.

Opposition often zeroes in on whatever advances God&#8217;s kingdom, whether a temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/bsb/ezra/4.htm">Ezra 4</a>) or the evangelistic efforts of the early church (<a href="/acts/4-17.htm">Acts 4:17&#8211;18</a>).
