In biblical times, covenants were solemn agreements often sealed with sacrifices or oaths. The idea of making a covenant "before our God" underscores the religious and moral obligation involved. Covenants in the Bible often signify a return to faithfulness, as seen in the covenants with Noah, Abraham, and Moses. This reflects a communal commitment to align with God's will, reminiscent of Joshua's covenant renewal at Shechem (<a href="/joshua/24-25.htm">Joshua 24:25</a>).<p><b>to send away all the foreign wives and their children</b><br>The issue of intermarriage with foreign women was a significant concern for the Israelites, as it often led to idolatry and a departure from the worship of Yahweh. This directive to send away foreign wives and children is rooted in the desire to maintain religious purity and obedience to God's commands. Historically, this reflects the post-exilic community's struggle to re-establish their identity and faithfulness to the Mosaic Law. The action is controversial and highlights the tension between cultural integration and religious exclusivity, similar to the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>.<p><b>according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the command of our God</b><br>This phrase indicates that the decision was not made unilaterally but was based on the advice of leaders and those who deeply revered God's commands. "My lord" likely refers to Ezra or another leader, while "those who tremble" suggests a group of devout individuals who fear God and respect His laws. This reflects a community-driven decision-making process, emphasizing the importance of spiritual leadership and collective accountability. The phrase echoes the reverence for God's word seen in <a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>, where God esteems those who are humble and contrite in spirit.<p><b>Let it be done according to the Law</b><br>The reference to "the Law" underscores the authority of the Torah as the guiding principle for the Israelites' actions. This appeal to the Law highlights the community's desire to align their lives with the divine statutes given through Moses. It reflects the post-exilic emphasis on legal adherence as a means of restoring and preserving the covenant relationship with God. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of obedience to God's commandments as a path to blessing and favor, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem.

That covenant was entered into before God, in the temple, by the princes and all the people (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 10). <span class="cmt_word">To put away all the wives</span>. Shechaniah probably held that marriages made contrary to the law were not merely wrongful, but invalid. At any rate, since the law of Moses, as interpreted by the Rabbis, allowed divorce "for every cause" (<a href="/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3</a>), the remedy suggested was feasible, though scarcely one which the civil power could enforce. <span class="cmt_word">And such as are born of them.</span> "Filii matrem sequuntur" was a maxim of Roman, and, apparently, also of Jewish law.
