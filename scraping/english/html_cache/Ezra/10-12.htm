This assembly consisted of the returned exiles who had been living in the land after the Babylonian captivity. The use of "loud voice" signifies a unified and earnest agreement, reflecting the seriousness of the situation. Historically, public assemblies were common in Israel for making significant communal decisions, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-11.htm">Deuteronomy 31:11-13</a>, where the law was read to the people. This collective response underscores the communal nature of repentance and obedience in Israelite society.<p><b>&#8220;Truly we must do as you say!</b><br>This declaration is a response to Ezra's call for repentance and reform regarding the intermarriage with foreign women, which was against the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). The phrase "Truly we must do" indicates a recognition of the necessity and urgency of obedience to God's commands. It reflects a moment of national repentance and a commitment to align with God's will, similar to the covenant renewals seen in the times of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/24-24.htm">Joshua 24:24</a>) and Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/8.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-3</a>). This act of obedience can be seen as a type of Christ's call to repentance and holiness, emphasizing the need for purity and separation from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem.
