The original temple, built by Solomon, was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC. The laying of the foundation signifies the beginning of the restoration of worship and the community's return to their covenant relationship with God. This event fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>, where God promises to bring His people back after 70 years of exile.<p><b>the priests in their apparel with trumpets</b><br>The priests' apparel was significant, as it was designed according to the instructions given in the Law of Moses (Exodus 28). Their garments symbolized purity and dedication to God. The use of trumpets is rooted in <a href="/numbers/10.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>, where trumpets were used for calling the assembly and directing the movement of the camps, as well as for celebrations and offerings. The presence of the priests and trumpets underscores the sacredness of the occasion and the continuity of worship practices.<p><b>and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) with cymbals</b><br>The Levites were a tribe set apart for religious duties, and the sons of Asaph were a specific group within the Levites known for their musical talents (<a href="/1_chronicles/25.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1-2</a>). Asaph himself was a prominent musician during the time of David. The use of cymbals, along with other instruments, was part of the worship tradition established by David (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>). This highlights the importance of music in worship and the continuation of Davidic traditions.<p><b>took their positions to praise the LORD</b><br>This phrase indicates an organized and intentional act of worship. The Levites and priests took specific positions, suggesting a structured liturgical practice. This organized worship reflects the order and reverence due to God, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/23.htm">1 Chronicles 23-25</a>, where David organized the Levites for temple service. It emphasizes the importance of preparation and dedication in worship.<p><b>as David king of Israel had prescribed</b><br>David's influence on Israel's worship practices was profound. He established many of the musical and liturgical traditions that continued into the Second Temple period. This reference to David underscores the continuity of worship practices from the united monarchy to the post-exilic community. It also points to the Davidic covenant (2 Samuel 7), which promised an everlasting kingdom, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Son of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/builders.htm">Builders</a></b><br>The group responsible for laying the foundation of the temple.

As the first offerings on the altar were according to what was "written in the law of Moses, the man of God," so the musical ceremonial of this foundation is according to the precedent of David (see 1 Chronicles 6, <a href="/1_chronicles/16-25.htm" title="For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.">1Chronicles 16:25</a>). The trumpets belonged to the priests, the cymbals to the Levites, in the ancient ordinances of worship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span> <span class="cmt_word">the builders</span> (Zerubbabel and Jeshua) <span class="cmt_word">laid</span> <span class="cmt_word">the foundation of the temple, they set the priests in their apparel -</span> the rich apparel, designed "for glory and for beauty," which the law required (<a href="/exodus/28-40.htm">Exodus 28:40</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-27.htm">Exodus 40:27-29</a>), and which the people had recently provided (<a href="/ezra/2-69.htm">Ezra 2:69</a>). With trumpets. To blow with trumpets was always the duty of the priests (<a href="/numbers/10-8.htm">Numbers 10:8</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-6.htm">Numbers 31:6</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-6.htm">1 Chronicles 16:6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>), to praise God with cymbals the task of the Levites (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16, 19</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12, 13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25</a>, etc.), perhaps because the trumpet was regarded as the instrument of greater dignity. <span class="cmt_word">After the ordinance of David</span>. David's ordinance on the subject is first expressed briefly in <a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>; afterwards, more fully, in vers. 17-21 of the same chapter. The musical service of Zerubbabel fell short of the "ordinance of David," since it comprised neither psalteries nor harps, which were an essential part of David's system. Apparently, the musical skill of the Levites had declined under the depressing circumstances of the captivity (see <a href="/psalms/137-2.htm">Psalm 137:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/3-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the builders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;b&#333;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
