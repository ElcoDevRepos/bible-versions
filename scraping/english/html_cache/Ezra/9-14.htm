The commandments referred to are those given through Moses, particularly those concerning separation from pagan practices and peoples (<a href="/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-16</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-4</a>). Historically, Israel's failure to adhere to these commandments led to spiritual and national consequences, including exile. The repetition of "again" underscores a pattern of disobedience and repentance throughout Israel's history.<p><b>and intermarry with the peoples who commit these abominations?</b><br>Intermarriage with foreign nations was explicitly prohibited because it often led to the adoption of idolatrous practices (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-8</a>). The "abominations" refer to the detestable practices of the surrounding nations, such as idol worship and child sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>). This prohibition was not about ethnic purity but about maintaining spiritual fidelity to God. The historical context includes the return from Babylonian exile, where maintaining a distinct identity was crucial for the community's survival and faithfulness.<p><b>Would You not become so angry with us</b><br>This rhetorical question reflects the understanding of God's righteous anger against sin. The Old Testament frequently depicts God as a just judge who responds to covenant unfaithfulness with discipline (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24-28</a>). The anger of God is not arbitrary but a response to the violation of His covenant, which was meant to guide Israel into a holy and set-apart life.<p><b>as to wipe us out, leaving no remnant or survivor?</b><br>The fear of total destruction echoes the warnings given in the Mosaic Law about the consequences of persistent disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63-68</a>). The concept of a "remnant" is significant in biblical theology, representing those who remain faithful and through whom God continues His redemptive work (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). The historical context of this passage is post-exilic, where the community is acutely aware of the fragility of their restored status and the importance of obedience to avoid further judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led a group of exiles back to Jerusalem.
