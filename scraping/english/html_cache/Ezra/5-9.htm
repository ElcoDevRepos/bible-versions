The elders were responsible for guiding the community and overseeing the reconstruction efforts. This questioning likely reflects the political and social tensions of the time, as the surrounding peoples were concerned about the re-establishment of a strong Jewish presence in the region. The elders' role is reminiscent of the leadership seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as the elders of Israel during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>).<p><b>and asked, &#8220;Who authorized you</b><br>The question of authority is central to the narrative. The Persian Empire, under King Cyrus, had initially authorized the rebuilding of the temple (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). However, subsequent opposition and changes in leadership led to confusion and challenges. This inquiry reflects the bureaucratic and legalistic nature of the Persian administration, which required official decrees for such significant undertakings. The question also highlights the importance of divine authority, as the Jews believed their mission was sanctioned by God Himself, as seen in the prophetic encouragement from Haggai and Zechariah (<a href="/haggai/1.htm">Haggai 1:1-15</a>; <a href="/zechariah/1.htm">Zechariah 1:1-6</a>).<p><b>to rebuild this temple</b><br>The temple in question is the Second Temple, which was to replace Solomon's Temple destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC. The rebuilding of the temple was not just a physical reconstruction but a spiritual renewal for the Jewish people. It symbolized the restoration of their covenant relationship with God and the re-establishment of proper worship practices. The temple's significance is further underscored by its role in future prophecy, as seen in the visions of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 40-48) and its mention in the New Testament as a type of Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<p><b>and restore this structure?&#8221;</b><br>The restoration of the temple structure was a monumental task, involving not only physical labor but also the re-establishment of religious practices and community identity. The term "restore" implies a return to a former state of glory and function, which was crucial for the Jewish people who had experienced exile and displacement. This restoration is a theme throughout the Bible, pointing to God's redemptive work in history and ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who restores humanity's broken relationship with God (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>). The physical restoration of the temple also prefigures the spiritual restoration brought about by Christ's atoning work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_the_jews.htm">Elders of the Jews</a></b><br>These are the leaders of the Jewish community who were responsible for overseeing the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem.

That tension persists whenever culture downplays what God calls holy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Persian officials questioned Judah&#8217;s elders, probing the legitimacy of the temple project. Their inquiry highlights recurring themes: worldly scrutiny of God&#8217;s work, the necessity of divinely granted authority, and the unstoppable faithfulness of God to fulfill His promises. Though the officials saw a controversial construction site, Heaven saw the reestablishment of worship that pointed forward to the greater temple&#8212;Jesus Christ Himself&#8212;assuring believers that when God commissions a task, He also secures its completion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/5-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1491;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_116.htm">Strong's 116: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, thereupon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we questioned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1433;&#1500;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;l&#601;&#183;n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7593.htm">Strong's 7593: </a> </span><span class="str2">To inquire, to request, to demand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;il&#183;l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_479.htm">Strong's 479: </a> </span><span class="str2">These</span><br /><br /><span class="word">elders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;&#7687;ay&#183;y&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
