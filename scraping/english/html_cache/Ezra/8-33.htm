This timing suggests a period of rest and preparation before the sacred task of weighing the treasures. The number four in biblical numerology often symbolizes completeness or universality, which may imply the thoroughness of their mission.<p><b>in the house of our God</b><br>This refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. The temple was not only a religious center but also a symbol of God's presence among His people. The phrase underscores the sacredness of the activities being conducted, as they were performed in a holy place dedicated to God.<p><b>we weighed out the silver and gold and sacred articles</b><br>The act of weighing the silver, gold, and sacred articles was a meticulous process to ensure accountability and integrity. These items were offerings for the temple, and their careful handling reflects the importance of stewardship in worship. The sacred articles likely included vessels and utensils used in temple services, emphasizing the reverence and care required in handling holy objects.<p><b>into the hand of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest</b><br>Meremoth, a priest, was entrusted with the responsibility of receiving the treasures. His lineage, being the son of Uriah, highlights the importance of priestly heritage and the trust placed in those who serve in the temple. Priests were mediators between God and the people, and their role in this context underscores the sacred nature of the task.<p><b>Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him</b><br>Eleazar, another priestly figure, is mentioned alongside Meremoth. His lineage, being the son of Phinehas, connects him to a line of zealous and faithful priests, as Phinehas was known for his fervor for God's holiness (<a href="/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11-13</a>). This connection reinforces the theme of faithfulness and dedication in temple service.<p><b>along with the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui</b><br>The inclusion of Levites, Jozabad and Noadiah, highlights the collaborative effort in temple service. Levites were responsible for assisting the priests and maintaining the temple, and their involvement signifies the communal aspect of worship and service.
