Bani is a name that appears multiple times in the lists of returnees from Babylonian exile, indicating a family that was significant in the restoration of Israel. This reflects the emphasis on re-establishing the covenant community and maintaining purity among the Israelites, as seen in Ezra's reforms.<p><b>Maadai:</b><br>Maadai is one of the individuals listed among those who had taken foreign wives, which was against the Mosaic Law. This reflects the broader issue of intermarriage with surrounding nations, which was seen as a threat to the religious and cultural identity of the Israelites. The call to separate from foreign influences was a recurring theme in the post-exilic period, emphasizing the need for holiness and adherence to God's commandments.<p><b>Amram:</b><br>The name Amram is significant in Israelite history, as it is also the name of Moses' father. While this Amram is not the same individual, the repetition of the name may suggest a connection to the Levitical or priestly lines, which were particularly concerned with issues of purity and covenant faithfulness. This highlights the ongoing struggle to maintain a distinct identity as God's chosen people.<p><b>Uel:</b><br>Uel is another individual among the descendants of Bani who had taken a foreign wife. The inclusion of specific names in this list underscores the personal responsibility and accountability of each member of the community in upholding the covenant.

Their inclusion here underscores that even respected clans can drift, yet God calls every generation back to covenant faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; By introducing this trio with the phrase &#8220;From the descendants of Bani,&#8221; Scripture affirms both corporate accountability and individual responsibility. God knows not only tribes and families but also every single heart (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-15</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The surrounding verses show a process of confession, agreement with God&#8217;s Word, and concrete steps of obedience (<a href="/ezra/10-11.htm">Ezra 10:11-12</a>). True repentance still follows the same pattern today (<a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Maadai</b><p>&#8226; Maadai is the first individual named in verse 34. His personal decision to stand with the repentant contrasts with earlier disobedience, illustrating that grace meets us when we turn (<a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; His inclusion also highlights that repentance is public and traceable. Just as Paul later urges believers to &#8220;prove their repentance by their deeds&#8221; (<a href="/acts/26-20.htm">Acts 26:20</a>), Maadai&#8217;s name is forever linked to a community-wide course correction.<p>&#8226; Notice how God records ordinary believers, not just leaders. This echoes Jesus&#8217; teaching that our Father &#8220;sees what is done in secret&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-4.htm">Matthew 6:4</a>) and will one day acknowledge faithful service (<a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Amram</b><p>&#8226; Amram follows on the list, reminding us that repentance is neither generational nor positional&#8212;it is personal. Like the Amram who fathered Moses centuries earlier (<a href="/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a>), this man&#8217;s name testifies that family heritage cannot replace present obedience (<a href="/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-9</a>).<p>&#8226; His willingness to be counted among the repentant aligns with the call in <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>: &#8220;Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By standing up in a moment of spiritual renewal, Amram models how God&#8217;s people should respond whenever Scripture exposes sin (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Uel</b><p>&#8226; Uel completes the trio. Though little else is recorded about him, his name in this verse shows that no act of repentance is too small to register in heaven&#8217;s ledger (<a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>).<p>&#8226; His example fits the broader biblical pattern: when confronted with sin, believers must separate from whatever competes with wholehearted devotion (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Uel joined Maadai and Amram in submitting to the leaders&#8217; directive (<a href="/ezra/10-16.htm">Ezra 10:16-17</a>), illustrating <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a>&#8212;strength is found in shared obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34</a> is more than a brief genealogical note; it captures three men&#8212;Maadai, Amram, and Uel&#8212;who, along with their larger family, owned their sin and acted to restore covenant faithfulness. The verse reminds us that God records individual responses, expects real repentance, and welcomes every heart that turns to Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/10-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">From the descendants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mib&#183;b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Bani:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1137.htm">Strong's 1137: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bani -- the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Maadai,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1491;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4572.htm">Strong's 4572: </a> </span><span class="str2">Maadai -- an Israelite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Amram,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;r&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6019.htm">Strong's 6019: </a> </span><span class="str2">Amram -- the father of Moses, also an Israelite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Uel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1469;&#1500;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_177.htm">Strong's 177: </a> </span><span class="str2">Uel -- desire</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezra/10-34.htm">Ezra 10:34 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezra/10-34.htm">OT History: Ezra 10:34 Of the sons of Bani: Maadai Amram (Ezr.
