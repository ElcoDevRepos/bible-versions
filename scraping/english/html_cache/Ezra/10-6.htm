The "house of God" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites. Ezra's actions demonstrate a separation from public ministry to engage in private mourning and intercession. This withdrawal can be seen as a precursor to Jesus' own moments of solitude for prayer and reflection, as seen in the Gospels.<p><b>and walked to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib.</b><br>Jehohanan, son of Eliashib, is likely a priestly figure, as Eliashib is mentioned in Nehemiah as a high priest. The chamber could be a private room within the temple complex, indicating a place of seclusion. This setting underscores the seriousness of Ezra's actions, as he seeks a quiet place to process the spiritual crisis facing the community. The mention of specific individuals and locations adds historical credibility and situates the narrative within the broader priestly lineage.<p><b>And while he stayed there, he ate no food and drank no water,</b><br>Ezra's fasting is a traditional expression of mourning and repentance in Jewish culture. Fasting is often associated with seeking God's favor or intervention, as seen in other biblical accounts such as Esther's fast (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>) and Jesus' fast in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). This act of self-denial highlights the gravity of the situation and Ezra's earnestness in seeking divine guidance.<p><b>because he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.</b><br>The "unfaithfulness of the exiles" refers to the Israelites' intermarriage with foreign nations, which was against the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). This unfaithfulness threatened the purity of the covenant community and their distinct identity as God's chosen people. Ezra's mourning reflects a deep concern for the spiritual well-being of the nation and aligns with the prophetic tradition of calling Israel back to covenant faithfulness. This theme of unfaithfulness and the call to repentance is echoed throughout the prophetic books and finds its ultimate resolution in the New Testament through the redemptive work of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem.

Stepping away shows a deliberate move from public lament to private intercession, echoing Moses leaving the camp to meet with the LORD outside the tent (<a href="/exodus/33-7.htm">Exodus 33:7&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The physical withdrawal highlights that true repentance requires both corporate and personal response; like Elijah retreating to Horeb after confronting sin in Israel (<a href="/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3&#8211;8</a>), Ezra models dependence on God rather than on crowd momentum.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and walked to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib.</b><p>&#8226; Temple chambers were set apart for priestly service and storage (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26&#8211;27</a>). Choosing this room, linked to a priestly family later mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/12-22.htm">Nehemiah 12:22</a>, places Ezra in a space dedicated to holiness, underlining the seriousness of the situation.<p>&#8226; The detail grounds the narrative historically and signals accountability; misuse of a chamber for Tobiah&#8217;s comfort later outraged Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4&#8211;9</a>). In contrast, Ezra uses the chamber for humble confession.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And while he stayed there, he ate no food and drank no water,</b><p>&#8226; Total abstinence shows an urgent, wholehearted fast, reminiscent of Moses on Sinai (&#8220;he ate no bread and drank no water,&#8221; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>) and Esther&#8217;s call for a fast before approaching the king (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Such fasting underscores dependence on God alone; Paul&#8217;s first three days as a believer were marked by the same intensity (<a href="/acts/9-9.htm">Acts 9:9</a>). The physical act reinforces spiritual desperation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;They have taken some of their daughters as wives &#8230; so the holy seed has been intermingled with the peoples of the land&#8221; (<a href="/ezra/9-2.htm">Ezra 9:2</a>).

Strict fasts of this kind had been observed by Moses twice (<a href="/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/9-18.htm">Deuteronomy 9:18</a>), and by the Ninevites (<a href="/jonah/3-7.htm">Jonah 3:7</a>), but they were very uncommon. Usually it was considered enough to abstain from eating (<a href="/1_samuel/1-7.htm">1 Samuel 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-34.htm">1 Samuel 20:34</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-35.htm">2 Samuel 3:35</a>). Sometimes the person who fasted merely abstained from "meat and wine, and <span class="accented">pleasant</span> bread (<a href="/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a>). Ezra's great earnestness appears in the severity of his fast, which (it is to be remembered) was not for his own sins, but for those of his brethren. PROCLAMATION MADE, SUMMONING ALL THE JEWS TO JERUSALEM (vers. 7- 9). After due deliberation between Ezra, the princes, and the elders (ver. 8), it was resolved, as a first step, to summon all Jews - or, rather, all those who had returned from the captivity, whether they were Jews or Israelites - to Jerusalem, in order that the decision come to with respect to the mixed marriages might be communicated to them. The limit of three days was fixed as the latest date at which any one might make his appearance, and absentees were threatened with the heavy penalties of excommunication and forfeiture of all their possessions. Proclamation having been made to this effect "throughout Judah" (ver. 7), there was a gathering of all the males of full age to Jerusalem within the prescribed time. The place of meeting was the great court of the temple (ver. 9). According to Hecataeus of Abdera (Fr. 14), this was "a stone-walled enclosure, about 500 feet long and 150 feet wide," which might perhaps afford sitting room for 20,000 men. Deducting the aged and infirm, the sick, and those between twelve and twenty years of age, the country Jews would scarcely have reached this number. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/10-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Ezra</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1494;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;ez&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5830.htm">Strong's 5830: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ezra -- 'help', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">withdrew</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
