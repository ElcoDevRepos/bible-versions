Harim is listed among the families in <a href="/ezra/2-39.htm">Ezra 2:39</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/7-42.htm">Nehemiah 7:42</a>. This indicates the importance of maintaining genealogical records for the priesthood, as only those of verified lineage could serve in the temple. The return from exile was a fulfillment of God's promise to restore Israel, and the inclusion of priestly families highlights the reestablishment of proper worship.<p><b>Eliezer,</b><br>Eliezer is a common Hebrew name meaning "God is my help." The name reflects a reliance on divine assistance, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. Eliezer's inclusion in this list signifies his role in the community's commitment to reform and adherence to the Law, as the chapter deals with the issue of intermarriage and the need for purity among the Israelites.<p><b>Isshijah,</b><br>Isshijah, also spelled Jeshaiah in some translations, means "Yahweh exists" or "Yahweh is salvation." This name underscores the theological emphasis on God's presence and deliverance. The presence of individuals with such names in the narrative serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and His people, which is central to the reforms being undertaken.<p><b>Malchijah,</b><br>Malchijah means "My king is Yahweh." This name reflects the theocratic nature of Israel, where God is recognized as the ultimate ruler. The inclusion of Malchijah in the list of those who addressed the issue of intermarriage suggests a commitment to living under God's kingship and adhering to His commandments, which were being compromised by foreign influences.<p><b>Shemaiah,</b><br>Shemaiah means "Yahweh has heard." This name is significant in the context of repentance and reform, as it implies that God is attentive to the prayers and actions of His people. The narrative of <a href="/ezra/10.htm">Ezra 10</a> involves the community's collective repentance and desire to align with God's will, indicating that God hears and responds to their commitment to change.<p><b>Shimeon,</b><br>Shimeon, a variant of Simeon, means "heard." This name, like Shemaiah, emphasizes the idea of God hearing His people. The repetition of this theme in the names listed suggests a focus on divine responsiveness to human actions, particularly in the context of repentance and covenant renewal. The narrative of <a href="/ezra/10.htm">Ezra 10</a> is about returning to faithfulness, and the names of those involved reflect the hope that God will hear and honor their efforts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/harim.htm">Harim</a></b><br>A priestly family mentioned in the context of those who had taken foreign wives, which was against the Law of Moses.

This single line packs weight because it shows:<p>&#8226; A specific individual&#8212;no hiding behind anonymity&#8212;called to account before God (see <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>, &#8220;your sin will find you out&#8221;).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness to name names so that sin is dealt with and not glossed over (compare <a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>, where specific believers are named).<p>&#8226; An invitation for us to respond personally; just as Eliezer&#8217;s compromise was identified, so the Spirit identifies ours (<a href="/james/1-23.htm">James 1:23-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Isshijah</b><p>Isshijah stands next in the list, reinforcing that the sin problem was widespread. Notice:<p>&#8226; More than one family member of Harim had compromised; sin can run in circles of influence (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet each man answers individually&#8212;biblical accountability is personal, not merely corporate (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The record highlights God&#8217;s call to separated holiness for His covenant people (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Malchijah</b><p>Malchijah&#8217;s inclusion teaches:<p>&#8226; Even leaders can fall; elsewhere men named Malchijah serve in priestly roles (<a href="/nehemiah/3-11.htm">Nehemiah 3:11</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/8-4.htm">Nehemiah 8:4</a>). The same name here warns that position never guarantees purity (<a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Restoration requires confession; Ezra labored for genuine repentance, not mere ritual (<a href="/ezra/10-10.htm">Ezra 10:10-12</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God cares about generational faithfulness&#8212;what Malchijah does impacts descendants yet unborn (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shemaiah</b><p>With Shemaiah the tally grows, underscoring:<p>&#8226; Sin seldom stands alone; compromise in one sphere opens doors in others (<a href="/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>, &#8220;A little leaven leavens the whole batch&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The matter was not racial prejudice but covenant fidelity; foreign wives brought foreign gods (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s mercy shines in granting space to repent before judgment (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shimeon</b><p>Finally, Shimeon rounds out the list, reminding us:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word leaves no loopholes; every offender is acknowledged (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Repentance involves hard choices&#8212;these men sent away wives and children (<a href="/ezra/10-44.htm">Ezra 10:44</a>). Costly obedience remains the mark of true discipleship (<a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; The naming assures future generations that holiness matters to God; Israel&#8217;s purity protected the Messianic line (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/10-31.htm">Ezra 10:31</a> is more than a roster; it is a divine spotlight exposing specific sin and calling for concrete repentance. By listing Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, and Shimeon, Scripture underscores God&#8217;s commitment to personal accountability, covenant holiness, and restorative grace. Each name testifies that compromise cannot stand unchallenged before a holy God, yet genuine confession can restore fellowship and secure the future of God&#8217;s people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/10-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">From the descendants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Harim:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;rim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2766.htm">Strong's 2766: </a> </span><span class="str2">Harim -- 'consecrated', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Eliezer,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1462;&#1447;&#1494;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#8216;e&#183;zer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_461.htm">Strong's 461: </a> </span><span class="str2">Eliezer -- 'God is help', the name of several Israelites, also of a Damascene</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Isshijah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3449.htm">Strong's 3449: </a> </span><span class="str2">Isshiah -- the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Malchijah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4441.htm">Strong's 4441: </a> </span><span class="str2">Malchijah -- 'my king is Yah', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Shemaiah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1469;&#1506;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;ma&#8216;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8098.htm">Strong's 8098: </a> </span><span class="str2">Shemaiah -- 'Yah hears', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Shimeon,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;im&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8095.htm">Strong's 8095: </a> </span><span class="str2">Simeon -- a son of Jacob, also his tribe, also an Israelite with a foreign wife</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezra/10-31.htm">Ezra 10:31 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezra/10-31.htm">Ezra 10:31 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezra/10-31.htm">Ezra 10:31 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezra/10-31.htm">Ezra 10:31 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezra/10-31.htm">Ezra 10:31 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezra/10-31.htm">Ezra 10:31  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezra/10-31.htm">Ezra 10:31 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezra/10-31.htm">Ezra 10:31 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezra/10-31.htm">Ezra 10:31 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezra/10-31.htm">Ezra 10:31 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezra/10-31.htm">OT History: Ezra 10:31 Of the sons of Harim: Eliezer Isshijah (Ezr.
