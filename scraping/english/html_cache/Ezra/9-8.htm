Historically, this refers to the time after the Babylonian exile when the Israelites were allowed to return to Jerusalem. It emphasizes the transient nature of human circumstances and the importance of recognizing God's timing.<p><b>grace has come from the LORD our God</b><br>The concept of grace here is central to the understanding of God's unmerited favor. In the context of Ezra, it refers to the favor shown by God in allowing the Israelites to return to their homeland. This grace is a precursor to the New Testament understanding of grace through Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>.<p><b>to preserve for us a remnant</b><br>The idea of a remnant is a recurring theme in the Bible, signifying a small, faithful group that survives judgment. This remnant is crucial for the continuation of God's covenant promises, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>. It highlights God's faithfulness in preserving His people despite widespread unfaithfulness.<p><b>and to give us a stake in His holy place.</b><br>This refers to the re-establishment of the Israelites in Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the temple. The "holy place" is the temple, which is central to Jewish worship and identity. This also foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers being the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>).<p><b>Even in our bondage,</b><br>This acknowledges the Israelites' continued subjugation under Persian rule despite their return to Jerusalem. It reflects the broader biblical theme of spiritual bondage and the need for deliverance, which is ultimately fulfilled in Christ's redemptive work.<p><b>our God has given us new life</b><br>The phrase "new life" suggests a renewal or revival, both physically in the return to the land and spiritually in the restoration of worship. This can be connected to the New Testament theme of being born again (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>), indicating a spiritual rebirth.<p><b>and light to our eyes.</b><br>"Light" often symbolizes understanding, revelation, and hope in the Bible. In this context, it signifies the enlightenment and hope that comes from God's intervention. This is echoed in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's word is described as a lamp to the feet and a light to the path, and in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the light of the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem.
