This highlights the importance of obedience to authority and the fulfillment of divine plans.<p><b>Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates,</b><br>Tattenai was a Persian official overseeing the province beyond the River, which included Judah. His role was significant as he initially questioned the Jews' authority to rebuild the temple (<a href="/ezra/5-3.htm">Ezra 5:3</a>).
