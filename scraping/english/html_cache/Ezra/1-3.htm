It emphasizes the continuity of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The call is inclusive, inviting all who identify with God's people to participate in the restoration of worship in Jerusalem. This echoes the covenantal language found in <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>, where God promises to be the God of Abraham's descendants.<p><b>may his God be with him</b><br>This blessing invokes God's presence and favor upon those who choose to return. It reflects the assurance of divine guidance and protection, reminiscent of God's promise to be with His people as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>. The phrase underscores the personal relationship between God and His people, highlighting the importance of individual faithfulness within the community.<p><b>and may he go to Jerusalem in Judah</b><br>Jerusalem is the central place of worship and the political and spiritual heart of Israel. The mention of Judah situates Jerusalem geographically and historically, as Judah was the southern kingdom that remained after the division of Israel.

The temple is not just a physical structure but a representation of God's dwelling among His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>. This act of rebuilding is a fulfillment of prophecy and a type of Christ, who is the ultimate temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<p><b>the God of Israel</b><br>This title reaffirms the unique relationship between God and the nation of Israel. It emphasizes God's faithfulness to His covenant and His role as the protector and redeemer of His people. The phrase connects to the broader narrative of God's dealings with Israel throughout the Old Testament, highlighting His sovereignty and commitment to His promises.<p><b>He is the God who is in Jerusalem</b><br>This statement underscores the significance of Jerusalem as the chosen city where God has placed His name (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>). It reflects the belief that God's presence is uniquely manifested in the temple, making Jerusalem the focal point of worship and divine interaction.

Gozan and Media, to which the ten tribes had been transported by the Assyrian monarchs, were within his dominions no less than Babylonia.

A pious wish, almost a blessing, indicative of the deep religious feeling and great goodness of heart which characterized Cyrus alone of Persian monarchs. Among the Greeks, AEschylus, who first speaks of him, calls him kindly" or "gracious" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); Herodotus says he ruled his subjects like a father; Xenophon makes him a model prince; Plutarch observes that "in wisdom and virtue and greatness of soul he excelled all other kings;" Diodorus ascribes to him a remarkable power of self-command, together with good feeling and gentleness. The Latin writers, Cicero and others, add their meed of praise; and altogether it may be said that, so far as the evidence reaches, no nobler character appears in ancient history. The Scriptural notices, whether in this book or in Isaiah, are in remarkable accord. <span class="cmt_word">Let him go up</span>. Jerusalem was on a much higher level than Babylon, and the travellers would consequently have to ascend considerably. <span class="cmt_word">And build</span> <span class="cmt_word">the house.</span> The "charge" to Cyrus did not require him to take a personal share in the building. He was simply to "say to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid" (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). He is therefore content to assign the actual work to others. <span class="cmt_word">He is the God</span>. The Septuagint and the Vulgate attach the last clause of the verse to these words, and render "He is the God who is in Jerusalem," which greatly weakens the force of the expression. According to this punctuation, Cyrus makes Jehovah a mere local Deity; according to the far preferable arrangement of the A. V., he declares emphatically that Jehovah is the one true God, beside whom there is no other.
