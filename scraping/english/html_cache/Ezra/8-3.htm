The mention of Shecaniah here may indicate a lineage of importance or leadership within the returning exiles. This reflects the emphasis on maintaining genealogical records, which was crucial for establishing identity and inheritance rights among the Israelites. The name Shecaniah means "the Lord has dwelt," which could symbolize God's presence with His people during the return from exile.<p><b>from the descendants of Parosh,</b><br>Parosh is one of the families listed among those who returned with Zerubbabel in the first wave of exiles (<a href="/ezra/2-3.htm">Ezra 2:3</a>). The name Parosh means "flea," which might seem insignificant, yet this family played a role in the restoration of Jerusalem. This highlights the theme of God using all people, regardless of their perceived status, in His redemptive plan. The descendants of Parosh were part of the community committed to rebuilding the temple and reestablishing worship in Jerusalem.<p><b>Zechariah,</b><br>Zechariah, in this context, is likely a leader or head of the family of Parosh. The name Zechariah means "the Lord remembers," which is significant in the context of the return from exile, as it underscores God's faithfulness in remembering His covenant with Israel. This name is shared by several notable figures in the Bible, including the prophet Zechariah, who encouraged the rebuilding of the temple. The presence of a leader named Zechariah among the exiles may have been a source of encouragement and hope.<p><b>and with him were registered 150 men;</b><br>The registration of 150 men indicates a formal and organized return, emphasizing the importance of community and accountability. This number reflects a substantial group, suggesting that the descendants of Parosh were committed to the restoration efforts in Jerusalem. The act of registration also underscores the importance of maintaining records for tribal and family lineage, which was crucial for the reestablishment of Israelite society. This organized return can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to restore His people, as prophesied in books like Jeremiah and Isaiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shecaniah.htm">Shecaniah</a></b><br>A family name mentioned in the genealogies of those returning from Babylonian exile.

Genealogies in Scripture are never filler; they trace covenant faithfulness through real people (see <a href="/1_chronicles/9-1.htm">1 Chronicles 9:1</a>, &#8220;all Israel was registered in the genealogies,&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Though this Shecaniah is otherwise obscure, his family&#8217;s decision to return from exile shows active trust in God&#8217;s promise to restore His people (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Their mention underscores that every household counted in rebuilding work&#8212;no name is too small for God&#8217;s record book (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the descendants of Parosh</b><p>&#8226; Parosh&#8217;s clan had already appeared in the first return under Zerubbabel: &#8220;the descendants of Parosh, 2,172&#8221; (<a href="/ezra/2-3.htm">Ezra 2:3</a>). Now a second contingent joins Ezra.<p>&#8226; This signals perseverance; decades after the initial wave, more of Parosh&#8217;s line respond to God&#8217;s call, illustrating how revival can spread generationally (<a href="/psalms/102-18.htm">Psalm 102:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The accuracy of these family rolls affirms the historical reliability of Ezra&#8217;s narrative and God&#8217;s meticulous care in fulfilling His word (<a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zechariah</b><p>&#8226; Zechariah is named as the leader of this group.
