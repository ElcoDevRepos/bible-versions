The "regular burnt offerings" refer to the daily sacrifices commanded in the Law of Moses (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>). These offerings were a central part of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. The reestablishment of these offerings signifies a return to covenant faithfulness and the restoration of worship practices after the Babylonian exile.<p><b>and those for New Moons</b><br>The New Moon offerings were part of the monthly religious observances (<a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>). The New Moon marked the beginning of the Hebrew month and was a time for special sacrifices and worship. This practice highlights the Israelites' commitment to observing God's appointed times and maintaining a rhythm of worship that acknowledges God's sovereignty over time.<p><b>and for all the appointed sacred feasts of the LORD</b><br>The "appointed sacred feasts" include Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles, among others (Leviticus 23). These feasts were times of communal gathering, remembrance, and celebration of God's deliverance and provision. By observing these feasts, the Israelites reaffirmed their identity as God's chosen people and their reliance on His promises.<p><b>as well as all the freewill offerings brought to the LORD</b><br>Freewill offerings were voluntary sacrifices given out of gratitude and devotion (<a href="/leviticus/22-18.htm">Leviticus 22:18-23</a>). Unlike the mandatory offerings, these were expressions of personal worship and thanksgiving. The inclusion of freewill offerings indicates a heartfelt response to God's grace and a desire to honor Him beyond the required rituals.

By reinstating these &#8220;regular&#8221; offerings, the people declare that ordinary days belong to God just as much as special occasions. Each burnt offering, wholly consumed on the altar, symbolized complete devotion (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). The exiles, freshly delivered from captivity, now display total surrender, echoing Abraham&#8217;s readiness on Mount Moriah (<a href="/genesis/22-9.htm">Genesis 22:9-14</a>) and pointing ahead to Christ&#8217;s perfect self-offering (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and those for New Moons</b><p>Monthly ceremonies marked the passing of time under God&#8217;s sovereignty (<a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>).

For example:<p>&#8226; Passover proclaims redemption from bondage (<a href="/exodus/12-26.htm">Exodus 12:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Weeks celebrates firstfruits and anticipates Pentecost&#8217;s outpouring (<a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Tabernacles looks back to wilderness provision and ahead to ultimate rest (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16-19</a>).<p>Each feast knits the community together around God&#8217;s faithfulness, shielding them from assimilation into surrounding cultures (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-14.htm">Deuteronomy 16:14-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as well as all the freewill offerings brought to the LORD</b><p>Beyond required sacrifices, individuals brought voluntary gifts expressing gratitude, vows, or spontaneous joy (<a href="/leviticus/22-18.htm">Leviticus 22:18-23</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-6.htm">Deuteronomy 12:6</a>). Freewill offerings reveal hearts stirred by grace rather than compulsion, echoing the generosity seen when the tabernacle was built (<a href="/exodus/35-29.htm">Exodus 35:29</a>).

The practice was resumed of sacrificing on the great altar at any time any free-will offerings that individual Israelites might bring (see <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1, 2, 3</a>, etc.). Thus provision was made for all that was most essential in the ritual of religion, while the temple itself still remained unbuilt (see ver. 6).

When the restoration of religion had pro-greased thus far, the civil and ecclesiastical rulers turned their attention to that object which had been specially mentioned in the "decree of Cyrus" (<a href="/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2, 3</a>), the rebuilding of the temple. And, first of all, it was necessary to collect building materials, wood and stone, which were the chief materials of the first temple, and which Cyrus had particularized in a supplementary decree (<a href="/ezra/6-4.htm">Ezra 6:4</a>) as those to be employed in the construction of the second. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/3-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After that,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1461;&#1438;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
