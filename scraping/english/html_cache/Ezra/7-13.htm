In the ancient Near East, such decrees were binding and carried significant weight. The use of "decree" underscores the king's support for Ezra's mission, highlighting the providential role of God in influencing the hearts of rulers (<a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><b>that any volunteers among the Israelites in my kingdom</b><br>The term "volunteers" suggests a willing participation, emphasizing the freedom given to the Israelites to return to Jerusalem. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to restore His people after the Babylonian exile (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>). The mention of "my kingdom" indicates the vastness of the Persian Empire, which included many Jewish exiles.<p><b>including the priests and Levites</b><br>The inclusion of priests and Levites is significant as they were essential for the restoration of proper worship and temple service in Jerusalem. This aligns with the emphasis on reestablishing religious practices and the centrality of the temple in Jewish life (<a href="/ezra/6-18.htm">Ezra 6:18</a>). The Levites' role in teaching the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>) would be crucial for the spiritual renewal of the community.<p><b>may go up with you to Jerusalem</b><br>The phrase "go up" is often used in the Bible to describe the journey to Jerusalem, which is geographically elevated. This journey symbolizes a spiritual ascent, reflecting the importance of Jerusalem as the center of Jewish worship and identity. The return to Jerusalem fulfills prophecies of restoration (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>) and prefigures the ultimate gathering of God's people, pointing to the eschatological hope found in Christ (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest, Ezra was a leader among the Israelites returning from Babylonian exile.
