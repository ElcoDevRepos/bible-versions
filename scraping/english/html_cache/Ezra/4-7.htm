This era followed the return of the Jewish exiles to Jerusalem, which began under Cyrus the Great. Artaxerxes' reign is significant in biblical history as it includes the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, who were instrumental in the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its walls. The mention of Artaxerxes situates this event within a broader historical context, highlighting the ongoing challenges faced by the Jewish community in re-establishing themselves in their homeland.<p><b>Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his associates</b><br>These individuals were likely local officials or leaders in the region surrounding Jerusalem. Their names suggest a mix of Persian and possibly Babylonian origins, indicating the diverse population in the area under Persian rule. The opposition from these figures reflects the broader resistance faced by the Jewish people from neighboring groups who were threatened by the re-establishment of a strong Jewish presence in Jerusalem. This opposition is a recurring theme in the post-exilic period, as seen in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.<p><b>wrote a letter to Artaxerxes</b><br>The act of writing a letter to the king underscores the formal and serious nature of the opposition. It was common in the Persian Empire for local leaders to communicate with the king regarding regional issues. This letter represents an official complaint against the rebuilding efforts in Jerusalem, aiming to halt the progress by appealing to the king's authority. The use of written communication also highlights the administrative sophistication of the Persian Empire, which maintained control over vast territories through such correspondence.<p><b>It was written in Aramaic and then translated</b><br>Aramaic was the lingua franca of the Persian Empire, used for official documents and communication across different regions. The mention of translation suggests that the letter was initially composed in Aramaic, the language of administration, and then translated, possibly into Hebrew or another local dialect for the Jewish leaders. This detail emphasizes the multicultural and multilingual nature of the Persian Empire, as well as the challenges of communication and governance in such a diverse setting. The use of Aramaic also reflects the historical context of the Jewish people, who had adopted Aramaic during the Babylonian exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/artaxerxes.htm">Artaxerxes</a></b><br>The king of Persia during this period, likely Artaxerxes I, who reigned from 465-424 BC.

Similar lists of opposition appear when Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem hinder Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; God allows such opposition to refine His people&#8217;s faith, just as later believers are told, &#8220;Do not be surprised at the fiery trial&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wrote a letter to Artaxerxes</b><p>&#8226; The enemies escalate their tactics from local harassment (<a href="/ezra/4-4.htm">Ezra 4:4&#8211;5</a>) to political maneuvering: &#8220;Bishlam &#8230; wrote a letter to Artaxerxes.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This mirrors the earlier letter written in the reign of Ahasuerus (<a href="/ezra/4-6.htm">Ezra 4:6</a>) and anticipates later accusations against Daniel (<a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their goal is to halt the rebuilding of Jerusalem by casting the Jews as rebellious subjects (<a href="/ezra/4-12.htm">Ezra 4:12&#8211;13</a>), a strategy Satan has employed since Eden&#8212;questioning and accusing (<a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God turns even hostile correspondence into part of His larger plan, eventually leading to the king&#8217;s decree that fully funds the temple&#8217;s restoration (<a href="/ezra/6-1.htm">Ezra 6:1&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It was written in Aramaic and then translated</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;It was written in Aramaic and then translated&#8221; explains why the narrative from <a href="/ezra/4-8.htm">Ezra 4:8</a> through 6:18 switches to Aramaic, the diplomatic language of the Persian empire&#8212;much like <a href="/daniel/2-4.htm">Daniel 2:4&#8211;7</a>:28.<p>&#8226; Including the original Aramaic preserves the exact content of the letter, underscoring Scripture&#8217;s precision (<a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of translation assures Hebrew readers of the message&#8217;s integrity, foreshadowing the clarity promised to the church: &#8220;I would rather speak five words with my mind &#8230; than ten thousand words in a tongue&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-19.htm">1 Corinthians 14:19</a>).<p>&#8226; That the Spirit inspired both the Aramaic original and its Hebrew setting reminds us of God&#8217;s desire for every generation to understand His works (<a href="/nehemiah/8-8.htm">Nehemiah 8:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7</a> records a real moment when Jerusalem&#8217;s opponents sought imperial power to stop God&#8217;s work.

Each element testifies to Scripture&#8217;s historical accuracy and God&#8217;s faithful oversight: earthly kings, foreign letters, and linguistic details all serve His redemptive plan, assuring believers that no scheme against His purposes will ultimately prevail (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">In the days of Artaxerxes.</span>--This must be Gomates, the Magian priest who personated Smerdis, the dead son of Cyrus, and reigned only seven months: note that the expression used is "days," and not "reign" as in the previous verse.

This would explain the reference to "the walls" in <a href="/ezra/4-12.htm" title="Be it known to the king, that the Jews which came up from you to us are come to Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.">Ezra 4:12</a>; but in <a href="/context/ezra/4-23.htm" title="Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.">Ezra 4:23-24</a> the sequence of events is strict, and the word "ceased" links the parts of the narrative into unity. Moreover, the Persian princes had often more than one name. At the same time, there is nothing to make such an anticipatory and parenthetical insertion impossible.<p><span class= "bld">In the Syrian tongue.</span>--The characters and the words were Syrian or Aramaic; this explains the transition to another language at this point,<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the days of Artaxerxes.</span> See the comment on ver. 6. If Artaxerxes be the Pseudo-Smerdis, we can readily understand why an application was not made to him at once, and how it came about that the Jews recommenced their building, as they appear from vers. 12, 13 to have done. The Pseudo-Smerdis was a usurper; his reign was a time of partial anarchy; in a distant part of the empire it would not be known for a while who was king. Men would be thrown on themselves, and would do as it seemed good in their own eyes. Later, there may have been some doubt whether a king, who was known to be a religious reformer, would follow the policy of his predecessor with respect to the Jews, or reverse it. Hence a delay, and then a more formal application than before for a positive decree to stop the building (see ver. 21). <span class="cmt_word">The rest of their companions</span>.
