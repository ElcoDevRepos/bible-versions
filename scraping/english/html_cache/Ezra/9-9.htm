This phrase acknowledges their status as captives, even after returning to their homeland. Historically, the Jews were under the rule of the Persian Empire, which allowed them limited autonomy. This reflects the broader biblical theme of spiritual bondage and the need for deliverance, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-20.htm">Romans 6:20-22</a>, where Paul discusses being slaves to sin before being set free by Christ.<p><b>Our God has not forsaken us in our bondage</b><br>Despite their physical and spiritual captivity, God remained faithful to His covenant with Israel. This echoes the promise found in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>, where God assures His people that He will never leave nor forsake them. It highlights God's enduring mercy and faithfulness, even when His people are unfaithful.<p><b>But He has extended to us grace in the sight of the kings of Persia</b><br>The Persian kings, particularly Cyrus and Darius, played a crucial role in the return of the Jews to Jerusalem. This grace is seen in the edicts that allowed the Jews to return and rebuild the temple (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). The favor shown by these kings can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to use foreign rulers for His purposes, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28 and 45</a>:1.<p><b>Giving us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins</b><br>The rebuilding of the temple was central to the restoration of Jewish worship and identity. The temple represented God's presence among His people, and its reconstruction was a sign of spiritual renewal. This act of rebuilding is a type of Christ, who spoke of His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), symbolizing the new covenant and the ultimate restoration through His resurrection.<p><b>And giving us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem</b><br>The wall symbolizes security and divine protection, essential for the survival of the returned exiles. Nehemiah's later efforts to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem (<a href="/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17-18</a>) further emphasize the importance of physical and spiritual fortification. This protection can be seen as a type of Christ, who is our ultimate protector and fortress, as described in <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the second group of exiles back to Jerusalem from Babylon.
