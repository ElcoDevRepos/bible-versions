The "God of our fathers" refers to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, emphasizing the covenant relationship established with Israel. This blessing is a form of praise and gratitude, recognizing God's sovereignty and faithfulness throughout generations. It reflects the Jewish tradition of blessing God for His actions and character, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/41-13.htm">Psalm 41:13</a> and <a href="/daniel/2-20.htm">Daniel 2:20</a>.<p><b>who has put into the heart of the king</b><br>This highlights God's sovereignty and His ability to influence the hearts of rulers, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, which states that the king's heart is in the hand of the LORD. The king referred to here is Artaxerxes I of Persia, who reigned during Ezra's time. This divine influence is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God uses even foreign kings to fulfill His purposes, as seen with Cyrus in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>.<p><b>to so honor the house of the LORD in Jerusalem</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was central to Jewish worship and identity. The king's decision to honor the temple signifies a recognition of its importance and a fulfillment of God's promises to restore and maintain His dwelling place among His people. This act of honoring the temple can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), where God's presence dwells fully. The restoration and honor of the temple also connect to prophecies about the rebuilding and future glory of Jerusalem, as seen in <a href="/haggai/2-9.htm">Haggai 2:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest, Ezra was a leader among the Jewish exiles returning from Babylon to Jerusalem.
