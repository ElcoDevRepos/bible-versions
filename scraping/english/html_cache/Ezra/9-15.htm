God's righteousness is His moral perfection and justice, which is consistently highlighted in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, <a href="/psalms/11-7.htm">Psalm 11:7</a>). In the context of Ezra, this declaration comes after the realization of the people's sins, particularly intermarriage with pagan nations, which was against God's commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). The acknowledgment of God's righteousness sets the stage for confession and repentance, recognizing that any judgment or discipline from God is just and deserved.<p><b>For we remain this day as a remnant.</b><br>The concept of a "remnant" is significant in biblical theology, often referring to a small, faithful group preserved by God despite widespread unfaithfulness or disaster (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>, <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>). In Ezra's time, the remnant refers to those who returned from Babylonian exile to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple. This remnant is a fulfillment of God's promise to preserve a portion of His people (<a href="/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>). The survival of the remnant underscores God's faithfulness and mercy, even when His people have been unfaithful.<p><b>Here we are before You in our guilt,</b><br>Ezra's prayer includes a confession of guilt, acknowledging the people's sins before God. This reflects the biblical principle that confession is necessary for forgiveness and restoration (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, <a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>). The guilt mentioned here is specifically related to the intermarriage with foreign nations, which threatened the purity of Israel's worship and obedience to God. The phrase emphasizes the importance of coming before God with humility and honesty about one's sins.<p><b>though because of it no one can stand before You.</b><br>This phrase highlights the severity of sin and its consequences. In biblical terms, to "stand before" God implies being in His presence without condemnation (<a href="/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>, <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). The acknowledgment that no one can stand before God due to guilt underscores the need for divine mercy and grace. It points to the ultimate solution found in Jesus Christ, who enables believers to stand before God justified (<a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1-2</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of human inability to achieve righteousness on their own and the necessity of God's intervention for redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led a group of exiles back to Jerusalem.

By naming Him &#8220;God of Israel,&#8221; Ezra recalls the unique relationship God forged with the nation at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>), a bond that makes their present compromise so serious (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are righteous!</b><p>&#8226; Ezra begins with God&#8217;s character, declaring that every act of the Lord is just and pure (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s righteousness guarantees both blessing for obedience and discipline for sin (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-45</a>).<p>&#8226; This confession mirrors <a href="/daniel/9-7.htm">Daniel 9:7</a>, reminding the people that God&#8217;s justice, not human fairness, is the ultimate standard (<a href="/romans/3-26.htm">Romans 3:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For we remain this day as a remnant.</b><p>&#8226; Despite exile and judgment, a surviving group stands in Jerusalem&#8212;evidence of God&#8217;s preserving mercy (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The remnant motif highlights hope: God always keeps a thread of faith alive, foreshadowing the church&#8217;s remnant identity (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Their very existence proves God has not rejected His promises (<a href="/nehemiah/9-31.htm">Nehemiah 9:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Here we are before You in our guilt,</b><p>&#8226; Ezra openly owns national sin: intermarriage with pagan nations (<a href="/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine repentance involves standing before God without excuses, echoing <a href="/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3-4</a> and <a href="/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8-9</a>.<p>&#8226; This posture invites divine cleansing rather than hiding sin (<a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>though because of it no one can stand before You.</b><p>&#8226;

Ezra&#8217;s words anticipate the need for a mediator greater than any priest&#8212;fulfilled in Christ, who enables sinners to &#8220;stand&#8221; by grace (<a href="/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement affirms that divine justice makes human boasting impossible (<a href="/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/9-15.htm">Ezra 9:15</a> is a model confession: it exalts God&#8217;s righteousness, acknowledges the fragile mercy shown to a surviving remnant, and admits guilt so deep that no one can endure divine scrutiny.
