Artaxerxes I reigned from 465-424 BC, and his decrees were binding across the vast Persian Empire. The reading of the letter signifies the formal and official nature of the communication, emphasizing the power of written royal edicts in the ancient world. This reflects the centralized control of the Persian administration and the importance of documentation in governance.<p><b>to Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their associates</b><br>Rehum and Shimshai were local officials in the Persian administration, likely tasked with overseeing the affairs of the province that included Jerusalem. Their roles as governor and scribe, respectively, suggest a bureaucratic structure where local leaders were responsible for implementing the king's orders. This highlights the tension between the returning Jewish exiles and the local authorities who were often opposed to the rebuilding efforts. The mention of their associates indicates a group effort to enforce the king's command, reflecting the organized opposition to the Jewish community.<p><b>they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem</b><br>The immediacy of their action underscores the urgency and seriousness with which they treated the king's decree. This reflects the historical context of opposition faced by the Jews from surrounding peoples who were threatened by the re-establishment of Jerusalem. The phrase also highlights the geographical proximity and the direct impact of Persian authority on the Jewish community. The Jews in Jerusalem were in the process of rebuilding the temple, a task that was central to their identity and religious practice.<p><b>and forcibly stopped them</b><br>This action represents the culmination of the opposition's efforts to halt the rebuilding of the temple. The use of force indicates the intensity of the resistance and the lengths to which the local officials were willing to go to comply with the king's orders. This reflects the broader theme of spiritual warfare and opposition that God's people often face. The cessation of work on the temple was a significant setback for the Jewish community, yet it also set the stage for future prophetic fulfillment and the eventual completion of the temple under later Persian kings. This opposition can be seen as a type of the spiritual opposition faced by Christ and His followers, emphasizing perseverance and faith in the face of adversity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_artaxerxes.htm">King Artaxerxes</a></b><br>The Persian king who issued the decree to halt the rebuilding of Jerusalem.
