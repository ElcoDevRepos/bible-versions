The historical context involves the Israelites returning from Babylonian exile and needing to re-establish their identity as God's chosen people. The prohibition against intermarriage is not based on ethnicity but on religious faithfulness, as seen in the story of Solomon, whose foreign wives led him astray (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>). This command underscores the importance of spiritual unity in marriage, a principle echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).<p><b>Never seek their peace or prosperity,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the need for separation from pagan influences that could lead to spiritual compromise. The Israelites were to avoid alliances that might lead to adopting foreign customs and gods. Historically, this reflects the post-exilic community's struggle to maintain distinctiveness amidst surrounding nations. Theologically, it highlights the call to holiness and the danger of syncretism. This principle is seen in the New Testament's call for believers to be in the world but not of it (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>).<p><b>so that you may be strong and may eat the good things of the land,</b><br>The promise of strength and prosperity is contingent upon obedience to God's commands. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings are tied to faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). The "good things of the land" refer to the abundance and fertility of Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). This promise is both physical and spiritual, as obedience leads to God's favor and provision.<p><b>leaving it as an inheritance to your sons forever.</b><br>The concept of inheritance is central to Israel's identity, with the land being a tangible sign of God's promise to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>). This inheritance is not just a physical territory but a spiritual legacy, emphasizing the importance of passing down faith and obedience to future generations. The eternal aspect of the inheritance points to the enduring nature of God's promises and foreshadows the eternal inheritance believers have in Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led a group of exiles back to Jerusalem and was instrumental in re-establishing the Law of Moses among the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who had returned from Babylonian exile and were being instructed by Ezra to maintain their distinct identity and holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/intermarriage.htm">Intermarriage</a></b><br>The event or practice being addressed, where Israelites were marrying people from surrounding nations, which was against God's commandments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship and the city to which the exiles returned, symbolizing the restoration of the Jewish community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/surrounding_nations.htm">Surrounding Nations</a></b><br>The pagan nations around Israel, whose practices and beliefs were contrary to the worship of Yahweh.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>God calls His people to be holy and distinct from the world.

This is the sole place in the Law where the double injunction is given, <a href="/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a> referring to the taking of wives only. <span class="cmt_word">Nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever.</span> So Moses had enjoined with special reference to the Moabites and Ammonites (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-6.htm">Deuteronomy 23:6</a>). With regard to the other idolatrous nations, the exact command was "to make no covenant with them" (<a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no terms of peace. Much the same was probably meant by both injunctions. <span class="cmt_word">That ye may be strong.</span> See <a href="/deuteronomy/11-8.htm">Deuteronomy 11:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And eat the good of the land.</span> These words are taken from <a href="/isaiah/1-19.htm">Isaiah 1:19</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And leave it for an inheritance,</span> etc. No single passage seems to be referred to here, but the clause embodies the idea found in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-9.htm">Deuteronomy 11:9</a>;
