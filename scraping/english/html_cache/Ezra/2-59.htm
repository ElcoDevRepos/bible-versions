Tel-melah and Tel-harsha are likely regions or settlements in Babylon, though their exact locations remain uncertain. The names suggest a connection to mounds or ruins, common in Mesopotamian geography. Cherub, Addan, and Immer may refer to family or clan names rather than specific places. The mention of these groups highlights the diverse origins of the returning exiles, emphasizing the widespread dispersion of the Israelites during the Babylonian captivity. This return fulfills the prophecy of restoration found in <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>, where God promises to bring His people back to their land.<p><b>but they could not prove that their families were descended from Israel</b><br>This phrase indicates a significant issue for the returning exiles: the inability to verify their genealogical records. In post-exilic Israel, lineage was crucial for determining one's place in society, especially for roles in the priesthood and temple service. The lack of proof could result in exclusion from certain religious and social privileges. This situation underscores the importance of genealogies in Jewish culture, as seen in other biblical passages like <a href="/nehemiah/7-61.htm">Nehemiah 7:61-65</a>, which parallels this account. It also reflects the broader theme of identity and belonging, as the Israelites sought to reestablish their covenant community in the Promised Land. The concern for legitimate descent foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on spiritual lineage through faith in Christ, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>, where believers are considered Abraham's offspring through faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tel-melah.htm">Tel-melah</a></b><br>A location from which some of the exiles returned. The name means "hill of salt," indicating a possible geographical feature or characteristic of the area.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tel-harsha.htm">Tel-harsha</a></b><br>Another location associated with the returning exiles. The name means "hill of the forest," suggesting a wooded area.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherub.htm">Cherub</a></b><br>Likely a place or a group of people. The name is similar to the Hebrew word for "cherub," a type of angelic being, but here it refers to a location or family group.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/addan.htm">Addan</a></b><br>A place or family group mentioned among those returning. The name is not well-defined but is part of the list of those whose lineage was uncertain.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/immer.htm">Immer</a></b><br>A priestly family mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. Here, it refers to a group whose genealogical records were not clear.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_identity.htm">The Importance of Identity</a></b><br>Understanding one's heritage and identity is crucial in the biblical account. For the Israelites, proving descent from Israel was essential for participating in the religious and social life of the community. Today, Christians can reflect on their spiritual identity in Christ and the importance of being part of the body of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_restoration.htm">God's Faithfulness in Restoration</a></b><br>The return from exile represents God's faithfulness in restoring His people. Despite uncertainties and challenges, God fulfills His promises. Believers can trust in God's faithfulness in their own lives, even when circumstances seem unclear.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_community.htm">The Role of Community</a></b><br>The returning exiles faced the challenge of re-establishing their community. This highlights the importance of community in the life of faith. Christians are encouraged to engage actively in their local church communities, supporting one another in faith and practice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_records_and_remembrance.htm">The Significance of Records and Remembrance</a></b><br>The emphasis on genealogical records in Ezra underscores the importance of remembering and recording God's work in our lives.

This isn&#8217;t abstract history; it is the fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>. The Lord had promised to return His people, and He kept that promise down to the last family.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From Tel-melah, Tel-harsha</b><p>These two place-names were towns in Babylonia where exiles had settled. They echo the scattering foretold in passages such as <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>, yet also highlight God&#8217;s gathering grace (<a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11&#8211;12</a>). Their inclusion shows that no matter how far the exiles had drifted geographically&#8212;or spiritually&#8212;they were welcome in the restored community.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cherub</b><p>&#8220;Cherub&#8221; may have been either a person&#8217;s family name or another settlement. <a href="/nehemiah/7-61.htm">Nehemiah 7:61</a> repeats the same word, confirming its historical reliability. Even when our knowledge about a location is limited, Scripture faithfully records every detail (<a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Addan</b><p>Like Cherub, Addan is otherwise unknown, yet its mention proves that God tracks every family by name (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>). To modern readers the word feels obscure, but to the returning exiles it represented friends and neighbors eager to worship again at the rebuilt temple (<a href="/ezra/3-1.htm">Ezra 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Immer</b><p>Immer immediately recalls the priestly division listed in <a href="/1_chronicles/24-14.htm">1 Chronicles 24:14</a> and the later priest Pashhur son of Immer (<a href="/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1</a>). Some members of that larger clan evidently lost their records during the seventy-year captivity. Their presence underscores how exile disrupted even priestly lineages, just as <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a> predicted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But they could not prove that their families were descended from Israel</b><p>Here lies the heart of the verse. Genealogical registers, kept faithfully since <a href="/numbers/1-18.htm">Numbers 1:18</a>, had gone missing. Without documentary proof, these people were placed on hold concerning full covenant privileges (compare <a href="/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62&#8211;63</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-64.htm">Nehemiah 7:64</a>). The standard was high because temple service required verified lineage (<a href="/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1&#8211;24</a>). God&#8217;s holiness demanded accuracy, yet His mercy still allowed them to return with the caravan and await a priest&#8217;s decision &#8220;with the Urim and Thummim&#8221; (<a href="/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63</a>). The tension between grace and order is a practical reminder today: sincere faith welcomes all, but leadership and teaching roles must honor God&#8217;s clear boundaries (<a href="/1_timothy/3-1.htm">1 Timothy 3:1&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezra/2-59.htm">Ezra 2:59</a> records a handful of returnees whose paperwork was missing. God knew their names, tracked their journey, and made room for them&#8212;yet He also guarded the purity of temple service by requiring proof of descent. The verse highlights both the faithfulness of God to gather His people and the seriousness of belonging to His covenant community.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezra/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(59-63) Finally, those who had lost the records of their lineage are mentioned. Of the people, the children of three families from Tel-melah, <span class= "ital">Hill of salt,</span> Tel-harsa, <span class= "ital">Hill of the wood,</span> and a few other places, are mentioned. Of the priests, there are also three families without their genealogy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 59.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tel-melah</span> is probably the Thelme of Ptolemy ('Geograph.,' 5:20), a city of Lower Babylonia, situated in the salt tract near the Persian Gulf. Hence the name, which means "Hill of Salt." <span class="cmt_word">Cherub</span> is no doubt Ptolemy's Chiripha, which was in the same region. The other places here mentioned are unknown to us, but probably belonged to the same tract of country. <span class="cmt_word">Tel-Harsa</span> means "Hill of the Wood." <span class="cmt_word">They could not show their father's house.</span> It is more surprising that so many of the returning exiles had preserved their genealogies than that a certain number had omitted to do so. Considering the duration of the exile, its hardships, and the apparent improbability of a restoration, there could have been no cause for wonder if the great majority had forgotten their descent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/2-59.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The following</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
