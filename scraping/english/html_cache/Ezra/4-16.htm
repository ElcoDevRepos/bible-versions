The use of "we" suggests a collective group, possibly officials or adversaries of the Jews, who are presenting their concerns. In the context of the Persian Empire, such advisories were common as the king relied on local governors and officials to maintain control over vast territories.<p><b>that if this city is rebuilt</b><br>The city in question is Jerusalem, which had been destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC. The rebuilding of Jerusalem was a significant concern for surrounding peoples who feared the re-establishment of a strong Jewish presence. Historically, Jerusalem was a fortified city, and its reconstruction could symbolize a return to political and religious independence.<p><b>and its walls are restored</b><br>Walls in ancient times were crucial for a city's defense and autonomy. The restoration of Jerusalem's walls would not only provide physical security but also signify the restoration of the Jewish community's identity and strength. <a href="/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3</a> later highlights the importance of the walls for the safety and dignity of the inhabitants.<p><b>you will have no dominion west of the Euphrates</b><br>This phrase reflects the geopolitical concerns of the time. The Euphrates River was a significant boundary in the ancient Near East, and control west of it was crucial for the Persian Empire's influence. The fear expressed is that a rebuilt Jerusalem could challenge Persian authority and disrupt the balance of power in the region.

While they appeal to concerns over taxation and control, Scripture affirms that God had ordained the rebuilding for His glory and for the unfolding of salvation history.
