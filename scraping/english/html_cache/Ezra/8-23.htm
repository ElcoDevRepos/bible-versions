In Ezra's time, fasting was a common practice among the Israelites when they faced significant challenges or sought divine intervention. This act of fasting demonstrates a deep reliance on God and a willingness to deny oneself to focus on spiritual matters. It reflects the tradition seen in other parts of Scripture, such as in the Book of Esther (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>) and the teachings of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16-18</a>).<p><b>and petitioned our God about this</b><br>Petitioning God involves earnest prayer and supplication, seeking His will and intervention in specific matters. The context here is Ezra's journey from Babylon to Jerusalem, which was fraught with potential dangers. By petitioning God, Ezra and the people acknowledged their dependence on Him for protection and guidance. This act of prayer aligns with other biblical examples where God's people sought His help, such as in the prayers of Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4-11</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3-19</a>).<p><b>and He granted our request</b><br>This phrase highlights God's faithfulness and responsiveness to the prayers of His people. It underscores the belief that God hears and answers prayers according to His will. The granting of their request can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to protect and guide His people, as seen throughout the Old Testament. It also serves as a testament to the power of collective prayer and fasting, reinforcing the idea that God is attentive to the needs of His followers when they earnestly seek Him. This assurance is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about the power of prayer (<a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led a group of exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.
