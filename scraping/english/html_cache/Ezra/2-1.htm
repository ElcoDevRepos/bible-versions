The term "province" indicates the administrative division under Persian rule, highlighting the shift from Babylonian to Persian control after Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon in 539 BC. This return marks the beginning of the post-exilic period, a significant era in Jewish history.<p><b>who came up from the captivity of the exiles</b><br>The phrase "came up" is often used in the Bible to describe the journey to Jerusalem, which is geographically elevated. The "captivity of the exiles" refers to the Babylonian Exile, a pivotal event in Jewish history when many Israelites were forcibly taken to Babylon following the conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BC. This return fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>, where God promises to bring His people back after seventy years of exile.<p><b>carried away to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar its king</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar II was the Babylonian king responsible for the destruction of Jerusalem and the subsequent exile of the Jewish people. This historical context is crucial, as it sets the stage for the fulfillment of God's promise to restore His people. The exile was a period of significant theological reflection and transformation for the Israelites, as seen in the writings of prophets like Ezekiel and Daniel.<p><b>They returned to Jerusalem and Judah</b><br>The return to Jerusalem and Judah signifies the physical and spiritual restoration of the Jewish people. Jerusalem, the city of David, holds deep religious significance as the location of the Temple, the center of Jewish worship. This return is seen as a fulfillment of God's covenant promises, as articulated in passages like <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, where Cyrus is named as the shepherd who will decree the rebuilding of Jerusalem.<p><b>each to his own town</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the restoration of the tribal and familial inheritances that were disrupted by the exile. The returnees were reestablishing their ancestral homes, which is significant for maintaining the identity and continuity of the Israelite tribes. This restoration is a type of the ultimate restoration promised in the Messianic age, where Jesus Christ, the true King, will gather His people and restore them to their spiritual inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_the_province.htm">The People of the Province</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who were exiled to Babylon and are now returning to their homeland.
