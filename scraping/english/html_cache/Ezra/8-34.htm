The verification process underscores the importance of integrity and accountability in the stewardship of resources dedicated to God. This practice reflects the broader biblical principle of honesty and transparency, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/8-20.htm">2 Corinthians 8:20-21</a>, where Paul emphasizes the importance of avoiding any suspicion in the administration of church funds. The careful accounting also mirrors the detailed instructions given for the construction of the Tabernacle in Exodus, where every material was accounted for and used according to God's specifications.<p><b>and the total weight was recorded at that time</b><br>Recording the total weight signifies the importance of documentation and record-keeping in ancient times, especially concerning sacred offerings. This practice ensured that the offerings were used appropriately and served as a historical record for future generations. The act of recording can be seen as a precursor to the genealogies and records found throughout the Bible, such as in the books of Chronicles, which serve to preserve the history and faithfulness of God's people. This meticulous recording also points to the prophetic fulfillment of God's promises, as the return from exile and the restoration of the temple were significant events in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, foreshadowing the ultimate restoration through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led a group of exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.
