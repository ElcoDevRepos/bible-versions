Responsive singing was a common practice, as seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136</a>). This method of worship emphasizes unity and collective expression of faith. The act of praising and giving thanks to the LORD reflects the Israelites' acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and faithfulness, especially significant as they return from exile and begin rebuilding the temple.<p><b>&#8220;For He is good; for His loving devotion to Israel endures forever.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration is a recurring theme in the Hebrew Scriptures, notably in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/100-5.htm">Psalm 100:5</a>, <a href="/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136:1</a>). It underscores God's unchanging nature and His covenantal faithfulness to Israel. The phrase "loving devotion" translates the Hebrew word "chesed," which conveys steadfast love, mercy, and loyalty. This assurance of God's enduring love was crucial for the Israelites as they faced the daunting task of rebuilding their nation and religious life after the Babylonian exile.<p><b>Then all the people gave a great shout of praise to the LORD,</b><br>The collective shout signifies a spontaneous and overwhelming expression of joy and gratitude. This moment mirrors other biblical instances where God's people respond with a loud shout, such as the fall of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>). It symbolizes victory, divine intervention, and the fulfillment of God's promises. The communal aspect of this shout also reflects the unity and shared purpose among the Israelites during this pivotal moment in their history.<p><b>because the foundation of the house of the LORD had been laid.</b><br>Laying the foundation of the temple was a significant milestone for the returning exiles, marking the restoration of their religious and cultural identity. The temple was central to Israelite worship and symbolized God's presence among His people. This event fulfilled prophecies about the return from exile and the rebuilding of the temple (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, <a href="/haggai/2-9.htm">Haggai 2:9</a>). It also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who referred to Himself as the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), indicating the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel who returned from Babylonian exile to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_foundation_of_the_temple.htm">The Foundation of the Temple</a></b><br>The initial stage of rebuilding the temple, marking a significant moment of renewal and hope for the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is praised for His goodness and enduring love.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple was being rebuilt, central to Jewish worship and identity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests_and_levites.htm">The Priests and Levites</a></b><br>Religious leaders who led the people in worship and thanksgiving.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_worship_in_community.htm">The Importance of Worship in Community</a></b><br>The Israelites sang responsively, indicating the communal nature of worship.

But religious shouting is less common. Still we hear of such shouting when the ark of the covenant was taken into the Israelite camp near Aphek (<a href="/1_samuel/4-5.htm">1 Samuel 4:5</a>), and again when David solemnly brought it up from Kirjathjearim to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/6-15.htm">2 Samuel 6:15</a>). Shouting appears also in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/47-5.htm">Psalm 47:5</a>) and in Zechariah (<a href="/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>) in connection with religion. It is always indicative of religious joy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezra/3-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And they sang responsively</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1469;&#1463;&#1440;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
