Babylon, located in modern-day Iraq, was the center of the Babylonian Empire, which had conquered Judah and taken many Jews into exile in 586 BC. Ezra's return is part of the larger narrative of the Jewish return under Persian rule, which began with the decree of Cyrus the Great in 538 BC (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). This return fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>, which promised that the exile would last seventy years.<p><b>He was a scribe skilled in the Law of Moses,</b><br>Ezra is described as a scribe, a role that involved copying, teaching, and interpreting the Scriptures. His expertise in the Law of Moses indicates a deep understanding of the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which were central to Jewish life and worship. This skill was crucial for the restoration of religious practices in Jerusalem. Ezra's role as a scribe also connects him to the tradition of preserving and transmitting God's Word, a task that would later be associated with the Pharisees and other Jewish teachers.<p><b>which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the Law, underscoring its authority and importance. The Law of Moses was not merely a human document but was given by the LORD, the covenant God of Israel. This highlights the special relationship between God and His chosen people, Israel, and the responsibility they had to live according to His commandments. The giving of the Law is a foundational event in Israel's history, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19-20</a>, where God gives the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai.<p><b>The king had granted Ezra all his requests,</b><br>The king referred to here is Artaxerxes I of Persia, who reigned from 465 to 424 BC. His support for Ezra's mission demonstrates the favorable policies of the Persian Empire towards the Jewish people, allowing them to return to their land and rebuild their temple. This royal favor is reminiscent of the earlier decree by Cyrus and shows God's providence in using foreign rulers to accomplish His purposes. Ezra's requests likely included resources and authority to lead the people and enforce the Law.<p><b>for the hand of the LORD his God was upon him.</b><br>This phrase indicates divine favor and guidance in Ezra's mission. The "hand of the LORD" is a biblical expression denoting God's power and presence, ensuring success in the endeavors of His servants. This divine assistance is a recurring theme in the book of Ezra, as seen in <a href="/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9 and 8</a>:18, and it underscores the belief that God actively intervenes in history to fulfill His promises. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are assured of God's presence and help, as in <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a> and <a href="/acts/11-21.htm">Acts 11:21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A priest and scribe, skilled in the Law of Moses, who played a crucial role in the spiritual and religious restoration of Israel after the Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place from which Ezra came, representing the location of the Jewish exile before their return to Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_of_moses.htm">The Law of Moses</a></b><br>The divine commandments and instructions given to Moses, forming the foundation of Jewish religious practice and law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord,_the_god_of_israel.htm">The LORD, the God of Israel</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is actively involved in the lives of His people and in the fulfillment of His promises.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Referring to Artaxerxes, the Persian king who granted Ezra's requests, showing favor towards the Jewish people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_god's_word.htm">The Importance of God's Word</a></b><br>Ezra's skill in the Law of Moses highlights the necessity for believers to be knowledgeable and skilled in Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_human_affairs.htm">God's Sovereignty in Human Affairs</a></b><br>The favor Ezra received from the king demonstrates God's control over earthly authorities to fulfill His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_exile.htm">Faithfulness in Exile</a></b><br>Ezra's commitment to God's law, even in Babylon, serves as an example of maintaining faithfulness in challenging circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership_in_spiritual_renewal.htm">The Role of Leadership in Spiritual Renewal</a></b><br>Ezra's leadership was pivotal in the spiritual revival of Israel, showing the impact of godly leadership.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_and_dependence_on_god.htm">Prayer and Dependence on God</a></b><br>Ezra's success was attributed to "the hand of the LORD his God upon him," emphasizing the importance of seeking God's guidance and favor.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezra_7_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezra 7:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezra_7_6_God_s_provision_for_seekers.htm">How does Ezra 7:6 demonstrate God's provision for those who seek Him?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Why_was_Ezra_a_skilled_scribe.htm">What qualities made Ezra a "skilled scribe" in the Law of Moses?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Ezra_s_study_dedication.htm">How can we apply Ezra's dedication to studying God's Word in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_God_s_hand_guide_us_in_Ezra_7_6.htm">In what ways does God's hand guide us, as seen in Ezra 7:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Ezra_7_6_Prov_3_5-6_Trust_in_God.htm">How does Ezra 7:6 connect with Proverbs 3:5-6 on trusting God's guidance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ezra_7_6_God_s_sovereignty_in_leaders.htm">How does Ezra 7:6 demonstrate God's sovereignty in guiding leaders?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezra_7_6_Divine_favor_in_leadership.htm">What does Ezra 7:6 reveal about the importance of divine favor in leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Ezra_7_6_God_s_faithfulness_shown.htm">How does Ezra's journey in Ezra 7:6 reflect God's faithfulness to His promises?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezra_7.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezra 7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_there_evidence_of_ezra's_mission.htm">In Ezra 7:6&#8211;7, is there any historical or archaeological evidence outside the Bible confirming Ezra&#8217;s authority and mission under Artaxerxes?

It is characteristic of Ezra's piety never to forget that the law was not a mere human code given by an earthly lawgiver, not even a national treasure, the accumulation of centuries, but a direct Divine gift "the law of the Lord" (ver. 10), "the words of the commandments of the Lord, and of his statutes to Israel" (ver. 11), "the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses" (<a href="/nehemiah/8-14.htm">Nehemiah 8:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to the hand of the Lord his God upon him</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "by reason of God's favour to him."
