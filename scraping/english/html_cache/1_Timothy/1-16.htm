This highlights the transformative power of God's grace. The concept of mercy is central to the New Testament, emphasizing God's willingness to forgive and restore. In the broader biblical context, mercy is a recurring theme, seen in God's dealings with Israel and in Jesus' ministry (e.g., <a href="/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>).<p><b>so that in me, the worst of sinners</b><br>Paul refers to himself as the "worst of sinners," underscoring his humility and recognition of his past transgressions. This self-identification serves to magnify the grace of God. It echoes his earlier statements in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">1 Corinthians 15:9</a> and <a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>, where he describes himself as the least of the apostles and the least of all the saints, respectively.<p><b>Christ Jesus might display His perfect patience</b><br>The patience of Christ is a testament to His enduring love and willingness to wait for sinners to repent. This patience is not passive but active, as seen in Christ's interactions with His disciples and others during His earthly ministry. The patience of God is also evident in the Old Testament, where He repeatedly calls Israel to repentance despite their rebellion (e.g., <a href="/nehemiah/9-30.htm">Nehemiah 9:30</a>).<p><b>as an example to those who would believe in Him for eternal life</b><br>Paul's transformation serves as a powerful example for future believers, illustrating that no one is beyond the reach of God's grace. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of redemption and the promise of eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> and <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>.

This pattern is spoken of as being the property of, being for the use of, them which should hereafter believe.
