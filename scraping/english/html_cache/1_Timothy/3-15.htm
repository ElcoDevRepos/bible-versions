This reflects the urgency and necessity of establishing order and sound doctrine in the early church. The apostle's travels were often unpredictable due to various factors such as weather, imprisonment, or opposition, which is evident in Acts and his other epistles.<p><b>so that you will know how each one must conduct himself</b><br>Paul emphasizes the importance of proper conduct within the church. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and order among God's people, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a> and <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>. The conduct of believers is a testimony to the world, aligning with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a> about letting one's light shine before others.<p><b>in God&#8217;s household</b><br>The metaphor of the church as God's household underscores the familial relationship among believers and their relationship with God as Father. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, where Israel is often referred to as God's people or family (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>). The New Testament expands this to include all who are in Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>.<p><b>which is the church of the living God</b><br>This phrase distinguishes the Christian community from pagan temples and dead idols, emphasizing the presence and activity of the living God among His people. The living God is a recurring theme in Scripture, contrasting the true God with lifeless idols (<a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>, <a href="/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15</a>). The church is the assembly of those who worship the living God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22-23</a>.<p><b>the pillar and foundation of the truth</b><br>The church is described as the pillar and foundation of the truth, indicating its role in upholding and proclaiming God's truth. This imagery may draw from the architectural features of ancient buildings, where pillars and foundations were crucial for stability and support. The church's responsibility is to maintain doctrinal purity and integrity, as seen in <a href="/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/2-15.htm">2 Timothy 2:15</a>. This also reflects the church's mission to be a witness to the truth of the gospel, as Jesus commissioned in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance on church leadership and conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233;

He refuses to leave Timothy guessing if that delay happens. The Spirit-inspired letter supplies what Paul would have taught in person, underscoring that Scripture is sufficient and trustworthy whether the apostle is present or absent (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that you will know</b><p>Knowledge here is practical. Paul is not delivering abstract theory; he wants Timothy&#8212;and by extension every believer&#8212;to grasp clear, actionable truth. Scripture repeatedly ties knowing to doing: &#8220;But be doers of the word, and not hearers only&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). Jesus Himself said, &#8220;If you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-17.htm">John 13:17</a>). This section reminds us that biblical knowledge carries moral responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>how each one must conduct himself</b><p>The focus shifts from information to transformation. Conduct is not optional; Paul says &#8220;must.&#8221; Other letters echo this call:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to Him&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>).<p>The standard for behavior comes from God, not culture. Timothy is to model and teach patterns of speech, relationships, and leadership that mirror Christ&#8217;s character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in God&#8217;s household</b><p>Believers are a family. <a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a> affirms, &#8220;You are &#8230; members of God&#8217;s household&#8221;. This identity shapes behavior: family members protect, encourage, and correct one another (<a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>). Paul is reminding Timothy that church life is not an event to attend but a household to steward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which is the church of the living God</b><p>The church belongs to the living God, the One who spoke the universe into being (<a href="/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15</a>) and who &#8220;gives life to everything&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/9-6.htm">Nehemiah 9:6</a>). Because God is alive and present, church gatherings are never mere rituals. The living God walks among His people (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>). That reality ought to inspire reverence, joy, and holy fear (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the pillar and foundation of the truth</b><p>Two architectural images highlight the church&#8217;s role:<p>&#8226; Foundation: Truth does not originate with the church&#8212;it is God&#8217;s revelation&#8212;but the church upholds it (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Pillar: Like columns lifting a roof high for all to see, the church displays God&#8217;s truth publicly (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>This mandate steers us away from watering down doctrine. Jesus prayed, &#8220;Sanctify them by the truth; Your word is truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>). Guarding and proclaiming that truth is central to the church&#8217;s calling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a> anchors Timothy&#8217;s ministry and ours. If travel or time keeps mentors away, Scripture still equips. Knowing leads to doing; conduct must align with the gospel. We behave as members of God&#8217;s household, conscious that the living God indwells His church. Together we bear the weight and the witness of divine truth, holding it firm and lifting it high for a watching world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_timothy/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">But if I tarry long.</span>--St. Paul felt that dangers were pressing closer and closer--that the hoped-for visit to his loved church at Ephesus might not, probably never would be, accomplished; so these foregoing solemn directions respecting the choice of colleagues in the ministry had been written to Timothy, that, in the event of St. Paul never coming to him again, men (especially the ministers of God) should know how to conduct themselves in the congregation.<p><span class= "bld">That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself.</span>--The words refer here not to Timothy alone, but rather to Timothy and his colleagues in their church work, concerning whom such particular directions had just been given, and should be rendered, <span class= "ital">how men ought to behave themselves.</span><p><span class= "bld">In the house of God.</span>--The image is from the Old Testament, where "the house of God" denotes, in the first place, the Temple of Jerusalem, and, in the second, the covenant-people. It is here used for the congregation of believers among whom God dwells--the true and enduring Church of living souls. Of this great spiritual temple, the corner-stone of which is Christ, the Jerusalem house on Mount Zion, with its marvellous work and its gorgeous and elaborate symbolism, was the poor, perishable, hand-wrought model.<p><span class= "bld">Which is the church of the living God.</span>--The house of God is here plainly defined to be the "Church" (or, <span class= "ital">congregation</span>) "of the <span class= "ital">living</span> God," who was working in its midst actively and personally, in strong contrast to that well-known graven image of the Diana of Ephesus, throned in that fair temple which glittered in its white and lifeless beauty over the roofs of the city where Timothy's charge lay.<p><span class= "bld">The pillar and ground of the truth.</span>--The imagery is here changed, and the "house of God" which the Apostle had just defined to be the Church, or congregation, belonging to the living God, and in the midst of which He was pleased to dwell, is now defined to be "the pillar and ground" (or, <span class= "ital">basis</span>) "of the truth." In the first picture, the Church is painted by St. Paul as a vast congregation, with the living God dwelling in its midst: in the second, the same Church is painted as a massive pillar, holding up and displaying before men and angels <span class= "ital">the</span> <span class= "ital">truth--</span>the saving truth of the gospel. In the first picture, the thought of a great company gathered together for God to dwell among is prominent: in the second, the thought of the great redemption-truth alone comes to the front, and the Church of God is no longer viewed as a company of separate individuals, but as one massive foundation-pillar, supporting and displaying the glories of redemption.<p>This peculiar aspect of the Church, "the support and pillar of the truth," was dwelt upon probably by the Apostle as "defining--with indirect allusion to nascent and developing heresies--the true note, office, and vocation of the Church. . . . Were there no Church, there would be no witness, no guardian of archives, no basis, nothing whereon acknowledged truth could rest" (Ellicott).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Men <span class="accented">ought to behave themselves</span> for <span class="accented">thou oughtest to behave thyself</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">To behave thyself</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); variously rendered, both in the A.V. and the R.V., "to have one's conversation," "to live," "to pass (one's time)," "to be used" (<a href="/hebrews/10-33.htm">Hebrews 10:33</a>). It is literally "to go up and down" a given place, "backwards and forwards," hence "to dwell in it." The substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, in the thirteen places where it occurs in the New Testament, is always rendered "conversation" in the A.V.; in the R.V., "manner of life," "life," "issue of life," "<span class="accented">manner</span> of living," "<span class="accented">behaviour</span>," "living." It is a favorite word in the two Epistles of St. Peter, where it occurs eight times. <span class="cmt_word">The house of God.</span> This phrase here denotes, as it is explained in the following words, the Church on earth. So <a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>, "<span class="accented">Christ</span> as a Son over his house; whose house are we," where the reference is to <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>, "<span class="accented">My</span> servant Moses... is faithful in all mine house." <span class="cmt_word">The Church of the living God.</span> Here is again a somewhat remarkable resemblance to the phraseology of the Epistle to the Hebrews, "Ye are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God.... to the general assembly and Church of the Firstborn" (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22, 23</a>). However, the phraseology is not peculiar to the Epistle to the Hebrews. Thus we read in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>, "<span class="accented">Ye</span> are the temple of the living God." The phrase, "<span class="accented">the</span> living <span class="accented">God</span>," occurs seven times in St. Paul's Epistles, and four times in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It occurs three times in the Gospels, once in the Acts of the Apostles, and once in the Revelation. Here it is used by St. Paul to enhance the obligation to a holy and blameless walk in those who have the oversight of his Church. <span class="cmt_word">The pillar and ground of the truth</span>. Some apply these words to Timothy himself (Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen, Basil, and others cited by Alford), after the analogy of <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>, where James, Cephas, and John are said to be "pillars" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), and <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, where it is said of him that over-cometh, "I will make him a pillar (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in the house of my God." And so, in Venantius Fortunatus, St. Paul is called "stilus ille." But the metaphors of "a pillar" and "a foundation" do not all suit the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; and it is well argued that the absence of the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> is unfavorable to the application of "the pillar and ground of the truth" to the subject of the first clause. It is therefore better to understand this clause as descriptive of the Church of God. The Church is the pillar of the truth. It supports it; holds it together - binds together its different parts. And it is the ground of the truth. By it the truth is made fast, firm, and fixed. <span class="cmt_word">The ground</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). This word only occurs here at all; <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, common both in the New Testament, the LXX., and in classical Greek, means "fixed," "firm," or" fast." In the A.V. of <a href="/1_corinthians/7-37.htm">1 Corinthians 7:37</a> and 1 Cor 15:58, "steadfast;" <a href="/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a> (where it is coupled with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), "settled." Thence <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> in late Greek, "to make firm or fast," and <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the "establishment" or "grounding" of the truth; that in and by which the truth is placed on a sure and fixed basis. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">so that,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2443.htm">Strong's 2443: </a> </span><span class="str2">In order that, so that.
