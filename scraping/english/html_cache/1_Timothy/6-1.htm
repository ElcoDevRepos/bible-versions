The term "yoke" implies a burden or obligation, reflecting the challenging conditions slaves often faced. Biblically, the concept of a yoke is used metaphorically to describe submission and service (<a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29-30</a>). The early church included both slaves and free individuals, and this instruction acknowledges the reality of their social structure while promoting a Christ-like attitude.<p><b>should regard their masters as fully worthy of honor</b><br>This directive emphasizes respect and honor towards masters, regardless of their character. The call to honor is consistent with biblical teachings on submission to authority (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>). The principle here is not an endorsement of slavery but a call to live out Christian virtues in all circumstances.

Similar pastoral counsel appears in <a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a> and <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22</a>, reminding servants that their ultimate Master is the Lord. This approach<p>&#8226; acknowledges the difficult reality without denying human dignity (cf. <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>).<p>&#8226; assures every believer&#8212;whatever the social setting&#8212;that God sees, cares, and provides guidance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>should regard their masters as fully worthy of honor</b><p>The command is not about endorsing every action of a human master; it is about the servant&#8217;s attitude. Honor means showing respect, diligence, and integrity, echoing <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a> (&#8220;Let every person be subject to the governing authorities&#8221;) and <a href="/titus/2-9.htm">Titus 2:9-10</a> (&#8220;Servants are to be submissive&#8230; so that in everything they may adorn the teaching&#8221;).

Paul&#8217;s concern is that the beauty of the message not be obscured by inconsistent lives.

It entered into all grades and ranks. It was common to all peoples and nations. The very fabric of society seemed knit and bound together by this miserable institution. War and commerce were equally responsible for slavery in the Old World. To attempt to uproot it--to preach against it--to represent it in public teaching as hateful to God, shameful to man--would have been to preach and to teach rebellion and revolution in its darkest and most violent form. It was indeed the curse of the world; but the Master and His chosen servants took their own course and their own time to clear it away. Jesus Christ and His disciples, such as St. Paul and St. John, left society as they found it, uprooting no ancient landmarks, alarming no ancient prejudices, content to live in the world as it was, and to do its work as they found it--trusting, by a new and lovely example, slowly and surely to raise men to a higher level, knowing well that at last, by force of unselfishness, loving self-denial, brave patience, the old curses--such as slavery--would be driven from the world. Surely the result, so far, has not disappointed the hopes of the first teachers of Christianity.<p>This curse at least is disappearing fast from the face of the globe. St. Paul here is addressing, in the first place, Christian slaves of a Pagan master. Let these, if they love the Lord and would do honour to His holy teaching, in their relations to their earthly masters not presume upon their new knowledge, that with the Master in Heaven "there was no respect of persons;" that "in Jesus Christ there was neither bond nor free, for all were one in Christ." Let these not dream for an instant that Christianity was to interfere with the existing social relations, and to put master and slave on an equality on earth. Let these, by their conduct to unbelieving masters, paying them all loving respect and honour, show how the new religion was teaching them to live.<p><span class= "bld">That the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.</span>--There would indeed be a grave danger of this, if the many Christian slaves, instead of showing increased zeal for their masters' service, should, as the result of the teaching of the new society they had joined, become morose, impatient of servitude, rebellious. Very soon in Pagan society would the name of that Redeemer they professed to love, and the beautiful doctrines He had preached, be evil spoken of, if the teaching were for one moment suspected of inculcating discontent or suggesting rebellion. An act, or course of acting, on the part of professed servants of God which gives occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, is ever reckoned in Holy Scripture as a sin of the deepest dye. Compare Nathan's words to King David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-14.htm" title="However,, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born to you shall surely die.">2Samuel 12:14</a>) and St. Paul's reproach to the Jews (<a href="/romans/2-24.htm" title="For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.">Romans 2:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">Are servants</span> for <span class="accented">servants as are</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the doctrine</span> for <span class="accented">his doctrine</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Servants</span>; literally, <span class="accented">slaves</span>.
