In ancient times, widows lacked the social and economic support that a husband provided, making them reliant on the community and family for sustenance. The Old Testament law provided specific instructions for the care of widows (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17-21</a>), and the early church continued this practice (<a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-6</a>). The emphasis here is on genuine need, distinguishing between those who have no other means of support and those who might have family to care for them.<p><b>and left all alone</b><br>This underscores the isolation and vulnerability of the widow in question. In the cultural context of the first century, family was the primary support system. A widow "left all alone" would have no children or relatives to care for her, making her plight more severe. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's concern for the lonely and marginalized (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5-6</a>).<p><b>puts her hope in God</b><br>The widow's reliance on God is a central theme, reflecting a deep faith and trust in His provision. This mirrors the biblical call for believers to place their trust in God rather than in human means (<a href="/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>). The widow's hope in God serves as a model of faith for all believers, emphasizing the importance of spiritual dependence over material security.<p><b>and continues night and day</b><br>This phrase indicates the widow's persistent and unwavering devotion. The reference to "night and day" suggests a life characterized by constant prayer and reliance on God, reminiscent of the call to "pray without ceasing" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>). This continuous devotion is a testament to her faith and commitment.<p><b>in her petitions and prayers</b><br>The distinction between petitions and prayers may suggest both specific requests and general communication with God. This reflects the biblical practice of bringing all concerns before God (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>). The widow's life of prayer is a powerful example of faithfulness and spiritual discipline, aligning with the broader scriptural call to seek God earnestly (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/widow.htm">Widow</a></b><br>In the context of 1 Timothy, a widow is a woman who has lost her husband and is without means of support.

We find also that, in the first years which succeeded the Ascension, many <span class= "ital">widows</span> in Jerusalem seemed to have been dependent on the Church for sustenance (<a href="/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>). Now we should expect to find in the Church of Christ the same loving care which was taken in the old days, when Israel was a great nation, of these solitary and unhappy women. (Comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/24-17.htm" title="You shall not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:">Deuteronomy 24:17</a>, where we find special laws respecting the garments of widows never to be taken in pledge. See, too, such passages as <a href="/exodus/22-22.htm" title="You shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-19.htm" title="Cursed be he that perverts the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm" title="Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-6.htm" title="If you oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:">Jeremiah 7:6</a>; also <a href="/isaiah/10-2.htm" title="To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm" title="And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:5</a>.) Still, this hardly accounts for the statement of <a href="/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a> and these lengthened directions to Timothy. It is more than probable that there were, especially in these Eastern cities, a very large class of these desolate and unprotected women. The practice of polygamy is accountable for this, in the first instance; and the rigid morality of the Christian teaching would place a bar to the female convert from heathenism relapsing into a life where moral restraints were utterly disregarded. The charities of the early Church, especially in Oriental cities, were, without doubt, heavily burdened with this grave and increasing charge--provision for these poor desolate women; and it was to relieve the congregations in some degree that St. Paul wrote these elaborate instructions to Timothy, warning him, as the chief minister of the Ephesian Church, against an indiscriminate charity, and at the same time providing him with a system of severe restraints to be imposed upon the assisted women. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="accented">Hath her hope set on</span> for <span class="accented">trusteth</span> in, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A widow indeed</span> (see ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">Desolate</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>; only here in the New Testament, rare in Greek versions of Old Testament, frequent in classical Greek); literally, <span class="accented">left alone</span>, or <span class="accented">made solitary</span>, which is also the exact meaning of "desolate," from <span class="accented">solus</span>, alone. A widow with children or grandchildren able to support her is not altogether desolate. As regards the connecting <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, rendered "now" both in the A.V. and the R.V., Bishop Ellicott rightly renders it "but." The apostle is contrasting the condition of the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, who has only God to look to for help, and who passes her time in prayer, with that of the widow with children and grandchildren. The second "but" in ver. 6 is no real objection; the widow who "giveth herself to pleasure ' is contrasted in her turn with the devout prayerful widow whose conduct has just been described. The inference intended to be drawn, as Ellicott justly remarks, is that the one is eminently fit, and the other eminently unfit, to be supported at the common charge of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Hath her hope set on God</span> (see <a href="/1_timothy/4-10.htm">1 Timothy 4:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Supplications and prayers</span> (see <a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Night and day.</span> Perhaps <span class="accented">by night and by day</span> would express the genitive better (<a href="/matthew/2-14.htm">Matthew 2:14</a>; <a href="/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a>), as indicating time <span class="accented">when</span>, rather than time <span class="accented">how long</span>. In <a href="/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>, Anna the prophetess is said to worship "with lastings and supplications night and day (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>)," where the accusative conveys rather more the notion of vigils prolonged through the night. As regards the order of the words, "day and night," or "night and day," there seems to be no rule. St. Mark always has "night and day" (<a href="/mark/4-7.htm">Mark 4:7</a>; <a href="/mark/5-5.htm">Mark 5:5</a>); St. Luke uses both (<a href="/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>; <a href="/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a>; <a href="/acts/9-24.htm">Acts 9:24</a>; <a href="/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="/acts/26-7.htm">Acts 26:7</a>). St. Paul always "night and day," as in this passage (<a href="/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>). St. John always "day and night" (<a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-11.htm">Revelation 14:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/5-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[The widow] who [is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7977;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
