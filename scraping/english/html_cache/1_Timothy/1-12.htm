This reflects the common practice in ancient letters to begin with thanksgiving. The use of "Christ Jesus" highlights the messianic role of Jesus, and "our Lord" signifies His divine authority and ownership over believers. This phrase sets the tone for the letter, focusing on the grace and empowerment received from Christ.<p><b>who has strengthened me</b><br>Paul acknowledges that his ability to serve comes from the strength provided by Christ. This is a recurring theme in Paul's writings, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, where he states, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." The empowerment by Christ is essential for Paul's ministry, especially considering his past as a persecutor of the church. This strength is not merely physical but spiritual, enabling him to endure hardships and fulfill his calling.<p><b>that He considered me faithful</b><br>Despite Paul's past, Christ saw his potential for faithfulness. This reflects the transformative power of grace, where God sees beyond our past and calls us to a new purpose. The term "faithful" indicates trustworthiness and reliability, qualities that are essential for leadership in the church. This also connects to the biblical theme of God choosing unlikely individuals for His purposes, as seen with figures like David and Moses.<p><b>and appointed me to service</b><br>Paul's appointment to service underscores the divine calling and mission he received. The word "service" (Greek: diakonia) implies a role of ministry and servanthood, aligning with Jesus' teaching that leadership in His kingdom is about serving others (<a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43-45</a>). This appointment is not based on Paul's merit but on God's grace and purpose. It highlights the idea that all believers are called to serve in various capacities within the body of Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ_jesus.htm">Christ Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, recognized as the Son of God and Savior.

Each phrase invites us to echo Paul&#8212;thanking Christ continually, leaning on His strength, walking in proven faithfulness, and embracing the specific ministry He assigns.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_timothy/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">who hath given me strength within.</span> The ancient authorities here are divided; the majority omit the first word of the verse, the connecting "and." With or without this word, the sense is much the same; for on the words, "the gospel . . . committed to my trust," the Apostle pauses, overwhelmed with the flood of grateful memories which such a thought let loose. "How I thank God," wrote St. Paul, "who hath strengthened me within, with this power to bear witness to my Master!--<span class= "ital">me</span> of all persons, who was once a blasphemer of His royal name! What an example I--your teacher, the founder of this Church of Ephesus--am of the transforming grace of the gospel--of its sweet, mighty power to forgive sins." It was the thought of the great love, passing understanding, of the tender, pitiful mercy which suffered so wondrous a trust to be committed to the charge of such a sinner, that called forth the ejaculation of deep thankfulness we read in the twelfth and following verses.<p>If we ask more particularly respecting the exact way in which Jesus Christ "enabled," or "strengthened St. Paul within," we must think of his strange power of winning men to his Master's side; we must remember his miraculous gifts over disease and even death; and last, but not least, that strength of endurance, that brave, sweet patience which made his life of suffering borne for Christ so beautiful, so touching, an example for men.<p><span class= "bld">For that he counted me faithful.</span>--The All. seeing, knowing from the beginning that St. Paul would continue steadfast and true, selected him as "His chosen vessel" to bear His name and the glad news of His salvation into many lands.<p>It is observable, however, that <span class= "ital">this very faithfulness, this unflinching steadfastness, </span>which seems to have been the reason why the Lord chose him for his great work, St. Paul, in a well-known and remarkable passage, refers to as a gift of grace which he had obtained in mercy of the Lord (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-25.htm" title="Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.">1Corinthians 7:25</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">thank</span> for <span class="accented">and I thank</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">him that enabled me</span>, <span class="accented">even Christ Jesus our Lord</span> for <span class="accented">Christ Jesus our Lord</span>, <span class="accented">who hath enabled me</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">appointing me to his service</span> for <span class="accented">putting me into the ministry</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I thank</span>, etc. This outburst of praise for the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ, who had called him to the ministry of the Word, is caused by the thought, which immediately precedes, of his being entrusted with the gospel. He thus disclaims any notion of merit on his part. <span class="cmt_word">That enabled me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). This verb occurs once in the Acts (Acts 9:22); three times in St. Paul's other Epistles (<a href="/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>); three times in the pastoral Epistles (here; <a href="/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a> and 2 Tim 4:17); and <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>. It denotes the giving that peculiar power which was the gift of the Holy Ghost, and which was necessary for the work of an apostle to enable him to bear witness to Christ in the face of an adverse world. This power (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) Christ promised to his apostles before his ascension (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). St Paul received it after his conversion (<a href="/acts/9-22.htm">Acts 9:22</a>). He continued to hold it throughout his apostleship (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>); he enjoyed it especially at the approach of his martyrdom (<a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>). It comprised strength of faith, strength to testify and to preach, strength to endure and suffer.
