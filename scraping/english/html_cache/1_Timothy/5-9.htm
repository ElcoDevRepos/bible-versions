The term "enrolled" suggests an official list or register, indicating a structured approach to providing for widows. This reflects the church's role in social welfare, a continuation of the Jewish tradition of caring for widows (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>). The enrollment likely involved both material support and a commitment to service within the church community, as seen in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-6</a>, where the early church appointed deacons to ensure fair distribution of resources to widows.<p><b>if she is at least sixty years old</b><br>The age of sixty was considered a threshold for old age in the ancient world, marking a transition to a period of life where remarriage was less likely and physical labor more challenging. This age requirement ensured that the church's resources were directed toward those most in need and less able to support themselves. It also reflects a cultural understanding of life stages, where sixty was seen as an age of wisdom and respect, aligning with the biblical emphasis on honoring the elderly (<a href="/leviticus/19-32.htm">Leviticus 19:32</a>).<p><b>faithful to her husband</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of marital fidelity, a value deeply rooted in biblical teaching (<a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-12</a>). The original Greek implies a "one-man woman," suggesting a widow who was devoted to her husband during their marriage. This requirement highlights the moral and ethical standards expected of those receiving church support, ensuring that the widow's life exemplified Christian virtues. It also parallels the qualifications for church leaders, such as elders and deacons, who are similarly described as "one-woman men" (<a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2, 12</a>), emphasizing consistency in character expectations across the church community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/widows.htm">Widows</a></b><br>In the early church, widows were often left without support and were a vulnerable group.

He would lay down some special rules here to be observed by his friend and disciple. What, now, is this organisation commended to Timothy in these special directions? Here, and here only in the New Testament, do we find it alluded to; but the instructions in this passage are so definite, so precise, that it is impossible not to assume in the days of Timothy and of Paul, in some, if not in all the great churches, the existence of an official band of workers, consisting of widows, most carefully selected from the congregation of believers, of a somewhat advanced age, and specially distinguished for devotion--possessing, each of these, a high and stainless reputation--they were an official band of workers, a distinct order, so to speak; for these widows, formally entered on the Church's list, could not possibly represent those poor and desolate widows, friendless and destitute, spoken of above. The minimum age of sixty years would also exclude many; and the advice of St. Paul to the younger ones to marry again could never have been addressed to women wanting even many years of the requisite "sixty." Were <span class= "ital">these</span> poor souls to be formally shut out from receiving the Church's alms? Again, those on the list could never be the same persons whom we hear of as deaconesses (<a href="/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a>, and in the Christian literature of the second century). The active duties of the office would have been utterly incompatible with the age of sixty, the minimum age at which <span class= "ital">these</span> were to be entered on the list. We then conclude these "widows" were a distinct and most honourable order, whose duties, <span class= "ital">presbyteral</span> rather than <span class= "ital">diaconic, </span>apparently consisted in the exercise of superintendence over, and in the ministry of counsel and consolation to, the younger women.--That they sat unveiled in the assemblies in a separate place by the presbyters; that they received a special ordination by laying on of hands; that they wore a peculiar dress--were distinctions probably belonging to a later age.<p><span class= "bld">Having been the wife of one man.</span>--Of the conditions of enrolment in this "order," the first--that of age--has been alluded to; the second--"having been the wife of one man"--must not be understood in the strictly literal sense of the words. It is inconceivable that the hope of forming one of the highly honoured band of presbyteral women depended on the chance of the husband living until the wife had reached the age of sixty years. Had he died in her youth, or comparative youth, the Apostle's will was that the widow should marry again. (See <a href="/1_timothy/5-14.htm" title="I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.">1Timothy 5:14</a>, where St. Paul writes, "I will that the younger women marry," &c.)<p>The right interpretation of the words is found in some such paraphrase as, "If in her married life she had been found faithful and true." The fatal facility of divorce and the lax state of morality in Pagan society, especially in the Greek and Asiac cities, must be taken into account when we seek to illustrate and explain these directions respecting early Christian foundations.<p>While unhesitatingly adopting the above interpretation of the words "wife of one man," as faithfully representing the mind of St. Paul, who was legislating here, it must be remembered, for the masses of believers whose lot was cast in the busy world (see his direct command in <a href="/1_timothy/5-14.htm" title="I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.">1Timothy 5:14</a> of this chapter, where the family life is pressed on the younger widow, and not the higher life of solitude and self-denial), still those expositors who adopt the stricter and sterner interpretation of "wife of one man"--viz., "a woman that has had <span class= "ital">only one husband"</span>--have, it must be granted, a strong argument in their favour from the known honour the <span class= "ital">univircae</span> obtained in the Roman world. So Dido, in <span class= "ital">'n.</span> iv. 28, says--<p>"Ille meos, primus qui me sibi junxit, amores<p>Abstulit, ille habeat secum, servetque sepulcher." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="accented">Let none be enrolled as a widow</span> for <span class="accented">let not a widow be taken into the number</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Let none be enrolled</span>, etc. The proper translation seems certainly to be (Ellicott, Alford, Huther, etc.), <span class="accented">let a woman be enrolled as a widow not under sixty years old</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> a is the predicate, not the subject. It follows that the word "widow" here is used in a slightly different sense from that in the preceding verses, viz. in the technical sense of one belonging to the <span class="accented">order of widows</span>, of which it appears from the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span> there was a regular roll kept in the Church. We do not know enough of the Church institutions of the apostolic age to enable us to say positively what their status or their functions were, but doubtless they were the germ from which the later development (of which see Bingham, bk. 7. <a href="/1_timothy/4.htm">1 Timothy 4</a>.) took its rise. We may gather, however, from the passage before us that their lives were specially consecrated to the service of God and the Church; that they were expected to be instant and con-slant in prayer, and to devote themselves to works of charity; that the apostle did not approve of their marrying again after their having embraced this life of widowhood, and therefore would have none enrolled under sixty years of age; and generally that, once on the roll, they would continue there for their life. <span class="cmt_word">Enrolled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span>); only here in the New Testament or (in this sense) in the LXX.; but it is the regular classical word for enrolling, enlisting, soldiers, etc. Hence our word "catalogue." In like manner, in the times of the Empress Helena, the virgins of the Church are described as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span> (Socr., 1:17), "registered in the Church's register," or list of virgins. <span class="cmt_word">Under three score years old.</span> A similar rule was laid down in several early canons, which forbade the veiling of virgins before the age of <span class="accented">forty</span>. This care to prevent women from being entangled by vows or engagements which they had not well considered, or of which they did not know the full force, is in striking contrast with the system which allows young girls to make irrevocable vows. The participle <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, "being," belongs to this clause (not as in the A.V. to the following one), as Alford clearly shows, and as the R.V. also indicates, by putting <span class="accented">having been</span> in italics; though it does not translate <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> in this clause, unless possibly the word "old" is considered as representing <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>. It should <span class="accented">be</span>, <span class="accented">Let none be enrolled as widows</span>, <span class="accented">being under sixty years of age</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The wife of one man</span>; see above, <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, the similar phrase, "the husband of one wife" (which likewise stands without any participle), and the note there. To which may be added that it is hardly conceivable that St. Paul should within the compass of a few verses (see ver. 14) recommend the marriage of young widows, and yet make the fact of a second marriage an absolute bar to a woman being enrolled among the Church widows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/5-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">A widow</span><br /><span class="grk">&#935;&#942;&#961;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Ch&#275;ra)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5503.htm">Strong's 5503: </a> </span><span class="str2">Feminine of a presumed derivative apparently from the base of chasma through the idea of deficiency; a widow, literally or figuratively.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">should be enrolled</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#941;&#963;&#952;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(katalegesth&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2639.htm">Strong's 2639: </a> </span><span class="str2">To enter in a list, register, enroll.
