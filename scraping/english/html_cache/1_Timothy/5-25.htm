It implies a parallel between the visibility of sins and good deeds, suggesting that just as sins can be evident, so can righteous actions. This reflects the biblical principle that actions, whether good or bad, often reveal the true nature of a person (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16-20</a>).<p><b>good deeds are obvious</b><br>Good deeds, or works, are often visible and evident to others. This aligns with the biblical teaching that believers are called to let their light shine before others (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>). The early church emphasized the importance of good works as a testimony to faith (<a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-26</a>). In the cultural context of the early church, acts of charity and hospitality were highly valued and served as a witness to the transformative power of the Gospel.<p><b>and even the ones that are inconspicuous</b><br>This phrase acknowledges that some good deeds may not be immediately visible or recognized by others. It suggests that God sees and values all acts of righteousness, even those done in secret (<a href="/matthew/6-3.htm">Matthew 6:3-4</a>). The early Christian community was encouraged to perform acts of kindness without seeking public recognition, reflecting a heart of genuine service and humility.<p><b>cannot remain hidden</b><br>Ultimately, all deeds, whether conspicuous or inconspicuous, will be revealed. This echoes the biblical theme that God will bring every deed into judgment, including hidden things (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). It reassures believers that their efforts in serving God and others will not go unnoticed by Him. This principle encourages perseverance in doing good, trusting that God will reward faithfulness in His time (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and personal conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, stationed in Ephesus, tasked with overseeing the church and ensuring sound doctrine and practice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was ministering, known for its diverse population and significant challenges in maintaining Christian teachings amidst pagan influences.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/visibility_of_good_deeds.htm">Visibility of Good Deeds</a></b><br>Good deeds naturally become evident over time, reflecting the inner character and faith of a believer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inconspicuous_goodness.htm">Inconspicuous Goodness</a></b><br>Even when good deeds are not immediately recognized, they will eventually come to light, encouraging believers to continue in righteousness without seeking immediate recognition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_action.htm">Integrity in Action</a></b><br>Believers are called to maintain integrity in their actions, knowing that God sees all and will bring hidden deeds to light.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_perseverance.htm">Encouragement in Perseverance</a></b><br>Christians should be encouraged to persevere in doing good, trusting that their efforts are not in vain and will be acknowledged in God's timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_to_the_world.htm">Witness to the World</a></b><br>The visibility of good deeds serves as a powerful witness to the world, drawing others to Christ through the demonstration of genuine faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Timothy_5_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Timothy 5:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_spot_clear_good_deeds_locally.htm">How can we discern "good deeds" that are "obvious" in our community?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_align_with_1_Timothy_5_25.htm">What steps ensure our actions align with 1 Timothy 5:25's teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_Tim_5_25_Matt_5_16_on_deeds.htm">How does 1 Timothy 5:25 connect with Matthew 5:16 about visible good deeds?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_show_others_your_good_deeds.htm">Why is it important that "good deeds" are evident to others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Encourage_others_to_do_good_deeds.htm">How can we encourage others to perform "good deeds" as described in 1 Timothy 5:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Tim_5_25_divine_justice_link.htm">How does 1 Timothy 5:25 relate to the concept of divine justice and accountability?

St. Paul bids him take courage in the thought that in many a case self-sacrifice, generosity, stern principle, will be sufficiently manifest to guide him in his choice of fit persons for the holy calling; and in those rarer cases where the higher and sweeter virtues are hidden, he may be sure that in God's good season these too <span class= "ital">will</span> become known to him, in ample time for him to call them also into his Master's service.<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS ON NOTES TO I. TIMOTHY.<p>ON A SUGGESTED INTERPRETATION OF CHAPTER 5:25.</span><p>IT has been suggested, with considerable ingenuity, that <a href="/1_timothy/5-25.htm" title="Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.">1Timothy 5:25</a> belongs to, and is an introduction of, a new division of the Epistle, where the Apostle gives Timothy instructions respecting certain teachings to be addressed to different ranks in the Christian society of Ephesus. The connection with <a href="/1_timothy/5-24.htm" title="Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.">1Timothy 5:24</a> then would be--as it is in the case of sins, so, too, it is in the case of good works. These latter are not always on the surface distinguishable. Some, of course, are manifest, but there is many a noble life the secrets of which will only come to light at the last day--"they cannot be hid" THEN. And this is too often the case with that unhappy class (the slaves), "those under the yoke," of whom the Apostle was about to speak (<a href="/context/1_timothy/6-1.htm" title="Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.">1Timothy 6:1-2</a>). It is possible that St. Paul meant here to turn Timothy's attention especially to those in slavery, that he might diligently search out the noblest and most devoted, and ordain (see <a href="/1_timothy/5-22.htm" title="Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.">1Timothy 5:22</a>) them to perform sacred duties, so that each class--the slaves as well as the rich and well-born--should possess representatives among the ordained ministers. This is at least possible when we consider the vast number of slaves--not a few of them, too, possessing high culture--in the world known by St. Paul and Timothy. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="accented">In</span> <span class="accented">like maturer</span> for <span class="accented">likewise</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">there are good works that are evident</span> for <span class="accented">the good works of some are manifest beforehand</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">such as</span> for <span class="accented">they that</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">There are good works</span>, etc. It is much best to understand <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, as the A.V. does, and render <span class="accented">the good works of some</span>, answering to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of ver. 24. <span class="cmt_word">Such as are otherwise</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, not manifest beforehand - <span class="cmt_word">cannot be hid.</span> "They will be seen and recognized some time or other" (Ellicott).
