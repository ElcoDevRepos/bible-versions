The mention of "children or grandchildren" highlights the biblical principle of family responsibility. In ancient Jewish culture, family was the primary social unit, and caring for one's relatives was a fundamental duty. This reflects the commandment to "honor your father and your mother" (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), emphasizing the importance of familial obligations.<p><b>they must first learn to show godliness to their own family</b><br>The phrase underscores the idea that true godliness begins at home. The family is seen as the first ministry for believers, where they practice their faith through acts of love and service. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>). The early church placed a strong emphasis on practical expressions of faith, and caring for one's family was a tangible demonstration of godliness.<p><b>and repay their parents</b><br>This concept of repayment is rooted in the biblical principle of reciprocity. Parents invest time, resources, and love into raising their children, and as they age, it becomes the children's responsibility to care for them in return. This reflects the cultural norms of the time, where multi-generational households were common, and the elderly were respected and cared for by their descendants. The idea of repayment also ties into the broader biblical theme of sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><b>for this is pleasing in the sight of God</b><br>The phrase emphasizes that caring for one's family is not just a social obligation but a spiritual one. It aligns with the biblical teaching that God values acts of love and service (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). Pleasing God is a central theme throughout Scripture, and this passage highlights that fulfilling family responsibilities is a way to honor Him. The idea that God is pleased with such actions is a reminder of the relational nature of faith, where believers seek to align their lives with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/widows.htm">Widows</a></b><br>In the early church, widows were often left without support and were a primary concern for the Christian community.

In Latin <span class="accented">nepotes</span>, "descendants;" <span class="accented">nos neveux</span> (in French), "our descendants;" and so the English word "nephews" (derived from <span class="accented">nepos</span>, through the French <span class="accented">neveu</span>) properly means, and is commonly so used in all old English writers, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in Holinshed (Richardson's Dictionary), "their nephews, or sons' sons, which reigned in the third place." Locke's phrase, "a nephew by a brother," seems to show the transition to the modern use of "nephew." But as the old meaning of "nephews" is now obsolete, it is better to substitute "grandchildren," as in the R.V. <span class="cmt_word">Let them learn.</span> Clearly "the children or grandchildren" is the subject. <span class="cmt_word">To show piety towards</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>). In the only other passage in the New Testament where this word occurs, <a href="/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>, it has also an accusative of the person - "whom ye worship." In classical Greek also <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is used as well as <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>.. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Their own family</span>, of which the widowed mother or grandmother formed a part.

As long as a widow has members of her own house who are able to support her, the Church ought net to be burdened (see ver. 16). <span class="cmt_word">To requite</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">to give back the return or exchange due</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;</span> is only found here in the New Testament, but is not uncommon in the LXX., and is much used in the best classical authors. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> had nourished and cared for them in their childhood; they must requite that care by honoring and supporting them in their old age. <span class="cmt_word">This is acceptable</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament or LXX., and rarely if ever in classical Greek.
