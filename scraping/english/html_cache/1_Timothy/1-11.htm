The "glorious gospel" refers to the good news of Jesus Christ, which is central to the New Testament. This gospel is described as "glorious" because it reveals the majesty and grace of God through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. The term "gospel" (Greek: euangelion) means "good news" and is a recurring theme throughout the New Testament, notably in passages like <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, where Paul declares it as the power of God for salvation. The gospel's glory is also highlighted in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, where it is described as the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ.<p><b>of the blessed God</b><br>The phrase "of the blessed God" underscores the divine origin and nature of the gospel. The term "blessed" (Greek: makarios) conveys a sense of divine happiness and fulfillment. This description of God as "blessed" is unique and emphasizes His perfect and self-sufficient nature. It reflects the Old Testament understanding of God as the source of all blessing, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103:1-2</a>. The use of "blessed" here also connects to the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>, where Jesus describes the blessedness of those who follow God's ways.<p><b>with which I have been entrusted</b><br>Paul's statement "with which I have been entrusted" highlights his role as a steward of the gospel. The concept of being "entrusted" (Greek: pisteuo) implies a responsibility to faithfully preserve and proclaim the message. This stewardship is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>, where he describes himself and other apostles as "servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God." The idea of being entrusted with the gospel also connects to the parable of the talents in <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>, where servants are given resources to manage on behalf of their master. Paul's sense of duty and accountability to God for the gospel is evident throughout his epistles, emphasizing the seriousness and honor of his apostolic mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, Paul, is writing to Timothy, his young prot&#233;g&#233;, to provide guidance and instruction for leading the church in Ephesus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and close companion of Paul, Timothy is the recipient of this letter.

"The glory of the blessed God," whether as shown in the sufferings of Christ or in the riches of His great mercy, is that which is contained in and revealed by the gospel; in other words, the "contents" of the gospel is the glory and majesty of God. God is called here "blessed," not only on account of His eternal and changeless perfection, but also on account of His blessed gift of forgiveness, offered to all sinners who accept His gospel of love.<p><span class= "bld">Which was committed to my trust.</span>--This precious deposit, this "trust," the gospel of the glory of God, was perhaps, in St. Paul's eyes, his truest title to honour. When we inquire more closely what was exactly meant by "the gospel committed to his trust," something more definite seems to be required than the general answer that he was a minister of the Church, intrusted with the proclamation of his Master's blessed message. If this were all, St. Paul's loved title to honour would have been by no means peculiar to him, but would have been shared by many another in that great company of prophets, teachers, and evangelists of the Church of the first days. St. Paul rather seems to have gloried in some peculiar and most precious trust. Was it not possibly in that Gospel of "Luke," which some of the most venerated of the fathers tell us St. Paul was accustomed to mention as the Gospel written by him? (Irenaeus, Origen, Jerome.) It was, perhaps, this blessed privilege of having been judged worthy to compile, under the direction of the Holy Ghost--or, at all events, largely to furnish materials for--one of the precious records of his adorable Master's earthly lite and work and suffering which St. Paul loved to tell of as his proudest title to honour.<p>To his own disciples--as well as to those who disputed his apostolic authority--he would now and again refer to this, the highest of all honours bestowed on him by his Master; but there the boasting of the holy and humble man of God ended. Though the blessed evangelist St. Paul knew his work was for all the ages, the true humility of the noble servant of Jesus appears in the substitution of "Luke" for "St. Paul"--the scribe's name in place of that of the real author.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">The gospel of the glory</span> for <span class="accented">the glorious gospel</span>, A,V. <span class="cmt_word">The gospel of the glory of the blessed God.</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, cannot mean, as in the A.V., "the glorious gospel of the blessed God," except by a very forced construction.

Or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "the glory of God" might mean Jesus Christ, who is the Brightness of God's glory, the Image of the invisible God, in whose face the glory of God shines (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4, 6</a>). Or <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it might mean the gospel which tells of the glory of God, which reveals and proclaims his glory, the glory of his grace (<a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6, 12</a>), or perhaps here rather the glory of his holiness, which St. Paul's "sound doctrine" pressed for imitation upon all Christians (see <a href="/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3</a>); comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, "<span class="accented">The</span> gospel of the glory of Christ."
