In <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, after each act of creation, God declares it "good," culminating in the declaration that it was "very good" (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>). This underscores the perfection and intentionality in God's design. The Apostle Paul, writing to Timothy, reaffirms this truth, countering any false teachings that might suggest otherwise. In the cultural context of the early church, there were ascetic groups that viewed certain aspects of creation, such as specific foods or marriage, as impure or lesser. Paul&#8217;s assertion here is a reminder of the goodness of God's creation, aligning with the broader biblical narrative that celebrates the created order.<p><b>and nothing that is received with thanksgiving</b><br>Thanksgiving is a central theme in Christian practice, reflecting an attitude of gratitude towards God. This phrase suggests that the act of receiving with thanksgiving sanctifies the creation. In the context of the early church, this was particularly relevant to debates over dietary laws and practices. By receiving God's creation with gratitude, believers acknowledge God's sovereignty and provision. This aligns with other scriptural teachings, such as <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>, which encourages believers to give thanks in all circumstances. Thanksgiving transforms the act of receiving into an act of worship, recognizing God's goodness and grace.<p><b>should be rejected</b><br>The rejection of God's creation, when received with thanksgiving, is discouraged. This addresses the issue of legalism and asceticism that was prevalent in the early church. Some groups, influenced by Gnostic beliefs, considered the material world as inherently evil. Paul counters this by affirming the goodness of creation and the importance of a thankful heart. This teaching is consistent with Jesus' own words in <a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-19</a>, where He declares all foods clean, emphasizing that it is not what enters the body that defiles a person. The rejection of God's good gifts, when received with gratitude, is contrary to the freedom and truth found in the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and Christian living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, serving in Ephesus, who received this letter as part of his pastoral training and encouragement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was ministering, known for its diverse culture and religious practices, which often conflicted with Christian teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals in the early church who were promoting ascetic practices and doctrines contrary to the gospel, which Paul addresses in this letter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>Refers to all that God has made, emphasizing the inherent goodness of God's creation as affirmed in Genesis.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_goodness_of_creation.htm">The Goodness of Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that everything God created is inherently good.

Paul is reaffirming that original verdict.<p>&#8226; The physical world, including food, marriage, and the rhythms of daily life, is pronounced good (<a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18&#8211;25</a>; <a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; This goodness stands in contrast to false teachers who were &#8220;forbidding marriage and abstaining from foods&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a> echoes the same point when Peter hears, &#8220;What God has made clean, you must not call impure.&#8221; God&#8217;s creations are blessed by His own declaration, not diminished by human rules.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and nothing that is received with thanksgiving</b><p>Paul adds an important qualifier: our reception of God&#8217;s gifts matters. &#8220;Nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4</a>b).<p>&#8226; Gratitude keeps us mindful that every bite, breath, and relationship is a gift from the Father of lights (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Thanksgiving guards the heart from idolatry&#8212;appreciating the gift without worshiping it (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/14-6.htm">Romans 14:6</a> reminds us that &#8220;he who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God.&#8221; Grateful reception turns ordinary actions into acts of worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>should be rejected</b><p>The phrase ends by denying that any of God&#8217;s good creations should be &#8220;rejected&#8221; when embraced with thanksgiving.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Rejection&#8221; here points to legalistic denials that undermine freedom in Christ (<a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/7-19.htm">Mark 7:19</a> records Jesus declaring all foods clean, undercutting ritual restrictions that miss the heart of God&#8217;s law.<p>&#8226; <a href="/titus/1-15.htm">Titus 1:15</a> summarizes Paul&#8217;s outlook: &#8220;To the pure, all things are pure.&#8221; When hearts are purified by faith, created things are enjoyed rightly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God&#8217;s world is good, and His gifts&#8212;when received with thankful hearts&#8212;are to be enjoyed, not condemned.

In fact, it is very difficult to construe the passage as the R.V. does. To say "nothing is to be rejected if it is received," is scarcely sense.

Nothing can be clearer or more certain than that the apostle is not arguing against the Manichean doctrine of the evil of matter, or the works of the Demiurge, but against Jewish scruples about meats. "Every creature of God," he says, "is good" - words which would have no force if the creatures in question were not admitted to be the works of God, but thought to be the works of the Demiurge. But applied to the Jewish scruples, the words are perfectly relevant. Every creature of God is good, and on no account to be treated as common or unclean (<a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15, 28</a>), provided only that it be received with thanksgiving. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/4-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">every</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#8118;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(pan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
