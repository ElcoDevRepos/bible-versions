The term "blessed" signifies God's perfect nature and the source of all blessings. "Only Sovereign" highlights God's unparalleled power and authority over all creation. In biblical context, this reflects the monotheistic belief central to Christianity, contrasting with the polytheistic views prevalent in the Roman Empire. The sovereignty of God is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>, which declares God's throne established in the heavens, and His kingdom ruling over all.<p><b>the King of kings and Lord of lords</b><br>This title underscores God's ultimate authority over all earthly rulers and powers. It is a declaration of His supreme rule, often used to describe Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14 and 19</a>:16. Historically, kings and lords were the highest authorities in ancient societies, but this phrase asserts that God's authority surpasses all. It also connects to Old Testament imagery, where God is depicted as the ultimate ruler, as in <a href="/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>, where God is acknowledged as the "God of gods and Lord of kings."<p><b>will bring about in His own time</b><br>This phrase speaks to God's perfect timing and divine plan. It reassures believers that God's purposes will be fulfilled according to His schedule, not human expectations. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which states there is a time for every purpose under heaven. The idea of divine timing is crucial in understanding prophecy and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, as seen in <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, where the coming of Christ is described as occurring in "the fullness of time."

It depended on the unknown and mysterious counsels of the Most High. The impression left upon our minds by the words of this and the preceding verse is that St. Paul had given up all hope of living himself to see the dawn of that awful day, but he deemed it more than probable that his son in the faith would live to witness it. Hence his words to him: "Keep the commandment without spot <span class= "ital">until</span> the Epiphany of our Lord Jesus Christ."<p><span class= "bld">Who is the blessed and only Potentate.</span>--The stately and rhythmical doxology with which the solemn charge to Timothy is closed was not improbably taken from a hymn loved by the Ephesian Christians, and often sung in their churches; the words, then, were, likely enough, familiar to Timothy and his people, though now receiving a new and deeper meaning than before. Well might Timothy, as example to the flock of Ephesus, keep "the commandment without spot, unrebukeable"--fearlessly, even though danger and death were presented before him as the sure reward of his faithfulness--for He who in His own times should reveal (show) the Lord Jesus returning to earth in glory, was inconceivably greater and grander than any earthly potentate, king, or lord, before whose little throne Timothy might have to stand and be judged for his faithfulness to the "only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords."<p>Of the first of these sublime titles, God is termed "the blessed," or <span class= "ital">the happy, </span>because He is the source of all blessedness and happiness; and the "only Potentate," in solemn assertion that the Christian's God was One, and that to none save to Him could this appellation "only Potentate" be applied.

The verb and the object are not of cognate sense (as "to display a display," or "to manifest a manifestation"), but the invisible God, God the Father, will, it is said, display the Epiphany of our Lord Jesus Christ. The wonder displayed and manifested to the world is the appearing of Christ in his glory. The Author of that manifestation is God. <span class="cmt_word">The blessed</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (not <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="/mark/14-61.htm">Mark 14:61</a>), is only here and in <a href="/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11</a> (where see note) applied to God in Scripture. <span class="cmt_word">The blessed and only Potentate.</span> The phrase is a remarkable one. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (Potentate), which is only found elsewhere in the New Testament in <a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a> and <a href="/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27</a>, is applied to God here only. It is, however, so applied in 2 Macc. 3:24 2Macc. 12:15 2Macc. 15:23, where we have <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x393;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f67;&#x1fc0;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>; in all which places, as here, the phrase is used to signify, by way of contrast, the superiority of the power of God over all earthly power. In the first of the above-cited passages the language is singularly like that here used by St. Paul. For it is said that <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "the Prince (or Potentate) of all power made a great apparition," or "appearing" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>), for the overthrow of the blasphemer and persecutor Heliodorus. St. Paul must have had this in his mind, and compared the effect of "the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ," in overthrowing the Neros of the earth with the overthrow of Heliodorus (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:7-10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">King of kings, and Lord of lords</span>, etc. (compare the slightly different phrase in <a href="/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a> and Revelation 19:16, applied to the Son). So in <a href="/psalms/136-2.htm">Psalm 136:2, 3</a>, God is spoken of as "God of gods, and Lord of lords." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/6-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">which</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7971;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[God] will bring about</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#949;&#943;&#958;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(deixei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1166.htm">Strong's 1166: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of an obsolete primary of the same meaning; to show.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in [His]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
