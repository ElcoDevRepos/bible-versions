In the Greco-Roman world, physical fitness was highly valued, with gymnasiums being central to many cities. However, the emphasis here is on the limitations of physical exercise in terms of spiritual and eternal significance. The Apostle Paul often used athletic metaphors (e.g., <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>) to illustrate spiritual truths, highlighting the temporary nature of physical training compared to spiritual growth.<p><b>but godliness is valuable in every way</b><br>Godliness, or living a life that reflects the character and teachings of God, is presented as having comprehensive value. This aligns with the biblical theme that spiritual disciplines and moral integrity have far-reaching effects. In the context of the pastoral epistles, Paul emphasizes the importance of sound doctrine and righteous living as essential for church leaders and believers. Godliness is not just a private matter but impacts community and witness (<a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6</a>).<p><b>holding promise for the present life</b><br>The benefits of godliness are not only reserved for the afterlife but also manifest in the present. This reflects the biblical principle that obedience to God's commands leads to a fulfilling and purposeful life (<a href="/proverbs/3.htm">Proverbs 3:1-2</a>). The teachings of Jesus, such as the Sermon on the Mount, illustrate how godly living results in peace, joy, and relational harmony, which are immediate blessings.<p><b>and for the one to come</b><br>This phrase underscores the eternal perspective of Christian faith. The promise of eternal life is a central tenet of Christianity, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> and <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. The assurance of a future with God provides hope and motivation for believers to pursue godliness. This eternal promise is rooted in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which guarantees believers' future resurrection and eternal life (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and personal conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, serving in Ephesus, who is the recipient of this letter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was ministering, known for its diverse culture and the Temple of Artemis, which was a center for pagan worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/godliness.htm">Godliness</a></b><br>A central theme in Paul's letters, referring to a life that reflects reverence and devotion to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/physical_exercise.htm">Physical Exercise</a></b><br>Mentioned as a metaphor for spiritual discipline, highlighting the temporary benefits of physical training compared to eternal spiritual growth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_godliness.htm">The Value of Godliness</a></b><br>Godliness holds eternal value, impacting both our current life and our eternal destiny.

Paul himself used athletic imagery more than once, calling believers to &#8220;run in such a way as to take the prize&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>). Exercise improves health, stamina, and even mental clarity, all of which can help us serve others. Yet even at its best, working out touches only the outer man. <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a> reminds us that life is &#8220;more than food, and the body more than clothes,&#8221; nudging us to keep fitness in perspective.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is of limited value</b><p>The benefit of exercise stops at the grave.

The stern repression of all human passions and desires, the abstinence from all compliance with the natural impulses of the flesh--such an unnatural warfare, such an exercise, such a training of the body, no doubt in many cases would lead, in many cases certainly has led, the individual to a higher spiritual state. Such a total surrender for the one who so exercises himself is, no doubt, in a certain sense, "profitable." But then it must be remembered that this kind of victory over the flesh, in very many instances, leads to an unnatural state of mind; for the rigid ascetic has removed himself from the platform on which ordinary men and women move. His thoughts have ceased to be their thoughts, his ways are no longer their ways. For practical everyday life such an influence, always limited, is at times positively harmful, as its tendency is to depreciate that home-life and family-life, to raise and elevate which is the true object of Christian teaching. Still, the Apostle, while remembering, and in his teaching ever carrying out, the spirit of the Lord's solemn prayer to the Father, "I pray, <span class= "ital">not</span> that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil," refrains from an <span class= "ital">entire</span> condemnation of a life which received, on more than one occasion, from the lips of the Sinless One a guarded commendation (<a href="/matthew/17-21.htm" title="However, this kind goes not out but by prayer and fasting.">Matthew 17:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-12.htm" title="For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.">Matthew 19:12</a>).<p>St. Paul, in his divinely-taught wisdom, recognises that such an austere and severe example and life, though by no means the ideal life of a Christian teacher, yet in the great world workshop of the Master might receive a blessing as "profitable for little."<p><span class= "bld">But godliness is profitable unto all things.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">for all things.</span> But while this "bodily exorcise," this austere subduing of the flesh, can only weigh with a narrow and circumscribed group, St. Paul points out that the influence of "godliness is world-wide;" a godliness, not merely an inward holiness, but an operative, active piety, which, springing from an intense love for Christ, manifests itself in love for His creatures. This godliness transfigures, and illumines with its divine radiance all busy, active life--every condition, every rank, all ages. That surely is what the good minister of Jesus Christ must aim at!<p><span class= "bld">Having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</span>--For this godliness, which may and ought to enter into all states, all ages of life, promises the greatest happiness to those who struggle after it. It promises "life"--that is, the highest blessedness which the creature can enjoy in this world--as well as the rich prospect of the endless life with God in the world to come; whereas a false asceticism crushes out all the joy and gladness of this present life, and is an unreal preparation for that which is future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">Is profitable for a little</span> for <span class="accented">profiteth little</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">for</span>, for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">which</span> for <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Bodily exercise.</span> Exercise which only affects the body, such as those rules which the Jewish ascetics enforced. <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> only occurs here in the New Testament, and not at all in the LXX., but is not uncommon in classical Greek.
