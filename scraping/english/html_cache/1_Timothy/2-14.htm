Adam, though not deceived, still chose to sin, which is significant in understanding the nature of sin and responsibility. In <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, the serpent directly deceives Eve, but Adam's sin is seen as willful disobedience. This distinction is important in theological discussions about the nature of sin and the fall of humanity. Adam's role as the head of the human race is emphasized in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12-19</a>, where his sin is seen as bringing death to all men.<p><b>but the woman who was deceived</b><br>Eve's deception by the serpent is detailed in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1-6</a>. This deception is often discussed in terms of the vulnerability and susceptibility to temptation. The cultural context of the time placed women in a different societal role, which is reflected in the narrative. The deception of Eve is sometimes used to discuss the nature of spiritual warfare and the importance of discernment. The New Testament often uses Eve's deception as a warning against false teachings, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>.<p><b>and fell into transgression</b><br>The transgression refers to the act of disobedience against God's command not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This act is the original sin that brought about the fall of humanity, as described in <a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6-7</a>. Theologically, this transgression is significant because it introduced sin into the world, affecting all of creation. The concept of transgression is further explored in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12-21</a>, where Paul discusses the contrast between Adam's sin and Christ's redemptive work. The fall is a pivotal event that sets the stage for the need for salvation through Jesus Christ, who is often seen as the "second Adam" in theological discussions, bringing redemption and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, according to Genesis.

Adam sinned willfully; Eve was deceived, yet both fell. By rehearsing this history, Paul urges men to bear godly responsibility and warns women against the serpent&#8217;s old tactics, all while pointing every believer to the only remedy&#8212;Christ, the second Adam, who reverses the first couple&#8217;s transgression for all who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_timothy/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">And Adam was not deceived.</span>--Priority in creation was the ground alleged by St. Paul as the reason why the woman was never to exercise authority over man, the eldest born of God. "Adam was not deceived;" the Apostle now refers to the general basis of his direction respecting the exclusion of women from all public praying and teaching contained in <a href="/context/1_timothy/2-9.htm" title="In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;">1Timothy 2:9-12</a>. The argument here is a singular one--Adam and Eve both sinned, but Adam was not deceived. He sinned, quite aware all the while of the magnitude of the sin he was voluntarily committing. Eve, on the other hand, was completely, thoroughly deceived (the preposition with which the Greek verb is compounded here conveying the idea of thoroughness)--she succumbed to the serpent's deceit. Both were involved in the sin, but only one (Eve) allowed herself to be deluded. So Bengel, "<span class= "ital">Deceptio indicat minus robur in intellectu, atque hic nervus est cur mulieri non liceat docere."</span> Prof. Reynolds thus comments on the argument of the Apostle:--"This may sound to our ears a far-fetched argument, when used to discountenance female usurpation of intellectual supremacy. It was, however, a method current at the time to look for and find in the Scriptures the concrete expressions of almost all philosophical judgments. At the present day we could hardly find a more vivid illustration of the essential difference between the masculine and feminine nature. If there be this distinction between the sexes, that distinction still furnishes the basis of an argument and a reason for the advice here rendered. The catastrophe of Eden is the beacon for all generations when the sexes repeat the folly of Eve and Adam, and exchange their distinctive position and functions."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="accented">Beguiled</span> (twice) for <span class="accented">deceived</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">hath fallen into</span> for <span class="accented">was in the</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Beguiled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>).
