The imagery of fighting suggests perseverance and struggle against spiritual adversaries, echoing Paul's exhortation in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where he describes the battle against spiritual forces. The "good fight" implies a noble and worthy struggle, aligning with the values and teachings of Christ. The use of "faith" indicates that this is not a physical battle but one of maintaining and defending the Christian doctrine and personal belief in Jesus Christ. Historically, the early church faced persecution and false teachings, making this exhortation particularly relevant. The metaphor of a fight also connects to athletic imagery used by Paul in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>, where he speaks of running a race to win an imperishable crown.<p><b>Take hold of the eternal life</b><br>This phrase calls for an active and intentional grasp of the promise of eternal life, which is a central tenet of Christian belief. The concept of eternal life is not just a future promise but a present reality that begins with faith in Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>. The imperative "take hold" suggests urgency and determination, reflecting the need for believers to live in a way that reflects their eternal destiny. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>, where He assures believers of eternal life and security in Him. The historical context of the early church, with its emphasis on the hope of resurrection and eternal life, underscores the importance of this exhortation.<p><b>to which you were called</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine initiative in the believer's life. The calling is a reference to God's sovereign choice and invitation to salvation, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>. It underscores the idea that eternal life is not earned but is a gift from God, initiated by His call. This calling is both a privilege and a responsibility, as believers are called to live in a manner worthy of their calling, as Paul writes in <a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>. The concept of calling also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's call to individuals and nations, such as Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>, emphasizing God's purpose and plan.<p><b>when you made the good confession</b><br>This phrase refers to a public declaration of faith, likely at baptism or another significant moment of commitment. The "good confession" is an acknowledgment of Jesus Christ as Lord, aligning with <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9-10</a>, where Paul speaks of confessing with the mouth and believing in the heart. This confession is both a personal and communal act, reflecting the early church's practice of public declarations of faith. The historical context of persecution and the need for courage in making such a confession would have been significant for Timothy and other early Christians. This confession also connects to Jesus' own confession before Pilate, as mentioned in <a href="/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>, serving as a model for believers.<p><b>before many witnesses.</b><br>This phrase underscores the communal aspect of the Christian faith. The presence of "many witnesses" suggests accountability and support within the Christian community. It reflects the early church's practice of public gatherings and communal worship, where confessions of faith were made before others. This public aspect of faith is important for encouragement and mutual edification, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>, which speaks of spurring one another on toward love and good deeds. The witnesses also serve as a reminder of the cloud of witnesses mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>, encouraging believers to persevere in their faith journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of the Apostle Paul, Timothy is the recipient of this letter.

So run, that you may obtain.">1Corinthians 9:24</a>; <a href="/context/philippians/3-13.htm" title="Brothers, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are before,">Philippians 3:13-14</a>)--the metaphor St. Paul loved so well, and which Timothy must have heard so often from his old master's lips as he preached and taught--he bids the "man of God," rising above the pitiful struggles for things perishable and useless, fight the noble fight of faith; bids him strive to lay hold of the <span class= "ital">real</span> prize--life eternal. The emphasis rests here mainly on the words "the good fight" and "eternal life." These things are placed in strong contrast with "the struggle of the covetous" and its "miserable, perishable crown." "The good fight," more closely considered, is the contest and struggle which the Christian has to maintain against the world, the flesh, and the devil. It is styled the "good fight of faith," partly because the contest is waged on behalf of, for the sake of, the faith, but still more because from faith it derives its strength and draws its courage. "Eternal life" is the prize the "man of God" must ever have before his eyes. It is the crown of life which the Judge of quick and dead will give to the "faithful unto death." (See <a href="/james/1-12.htm" title="Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.">James 1:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm" title="Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.">Revelation 2:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Whereunto thou art also called.</span>--The "calling" here refers both to the inner and outward call to the Master's work. The inner call is the persuasion in the heart that the one vocation to which the life must be dedicated was the ministry of the word; and the outward call is the summons by St. Paul, ratified by the church in the persons of the presbyters of Lystra.<p><span class= "bld">And hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.</span>--More accurately translated, <span class= "ital">and</span> <span class= "ital">thou confessedst the good confession</span> . . . These words simply add to the foregoing clause another ground of exhortation: "Thou wast called to eternal life, and thou madest the good confession." When--has been asked--was this good confession made? Several epochs in the life of Timothy have been suggested. Were it not for the difficulty of fixing a date for so terrible an experience in Timothy's, comparatively speaking, short life, it would appear most probable that the confession was made on the occasion of some persecution or bitter trial to which he had been exposed. On the whole, however, it appears safer to refer "the good confession" to the time of his ordination. In this case the many witnesses would refer to the presbyters and others who were present at the solemn rite.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="accented">The faith</span> for <span class="accented">faith</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the life eternal</span> for <span class="accented">eternal life</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">wast</span> for <span class="accented">art also</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">didst confess the good confession</span> for <span class="accented">hast professed a good profession</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in the sight of</span> for <span class="accented">before</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Fight the good fight</span>.

He seems here to drop the metaphor, as in the following clause. <span class="cmt_word">Didst confess the good confession.</span> The connection of this phrase with the call to eternal life, and the allusion to one special occasion on which Timothy "had confessed the good confession" of his faith in Jesus Christ, seems to point clearly to his baptism (see <a href="/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>; <a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>; <a href="/john/12-42.htm">John 12:42</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>). The phrase, "the good confession," seems to have been technically applied to the baptismal confession of Christ (compare the other Church sayings, <a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-1.htm">1 Timothy 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-9.htm">1 Timothy 4:9</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11</a>; <a href="/titus/3-8.htm">Titus 3:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the sight of many witnesses.</span> The whole congregation of the Church, who were witnesses of his baptism (see the rubric prefixed to the Order of "Ministration of Public Baptism" in the Book of Common Prayer). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/6-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Fight</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(ag&#333;nizou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Middle or Passive - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_75.htm">Strong's 75: </a> </span><span class="str2">From agon; to struggle, literally, figuratively, or genitive case.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
