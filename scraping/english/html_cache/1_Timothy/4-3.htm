This reflects a misunderstanding of the goodness of God's creation, as marriage was instituted by God in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>. The prohibition of marriage contradicts the biblical view that marriage is honorable (<a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>) and a reflection of Christ's relationship with the Church (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>). Historically, certain sects, such as the Gnostics, viewed the material world as evil, leading them to reject marriage. This teaching is a departure from the truth that God declared His creation, including marriage, as "very good" (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>).<p><b>and require abstinence from certain foods</b><br>The requirement to abstain from certain foods echoes the Old Testament dietary laws, which were fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-19</a>, <a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>). In the New Testament, believers are no longer bound by these restrictions, as salvation is not dependent on dietary practices (<a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-17</a>). The insistence on abstaining from foods reflects a legalistic approach that undermines the freedom found in Christ (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). This teaching may have been influenced by Jewish traditions or ascetic philosophies that viewed physical indulgence as sinful.<p><b>that God has created to be received with thanksgiving</b><br>God's creation, including food, is intended to be enjoyed with gratitude. This principle is rooted in the acknowledgment of God as the provider of all good things (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). The act of giving thanks sanctifies the believer's use of creation, aligning with the practice of blessing meals (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-30.htm">1 Corinthians 10:30-31</a>). Thanksgiving is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing a heart of gratitude as a response to God's provision (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>).<p><b>by those who believe and know the truth</b><br>Believers, who have accepted the truth of the Gospel, recognize the freedom they have in Christ.

The phrase underscores the importance of discernment and understanding in the life of a believer, as they navigate teachings that may contradict the Gospel.

This teaching was probably, even in those early days, creeping into the churches. The Jewish sects of Essenes and Therapeutae had already taught that "abstinence from marriage" was meritorious. Men belonging to these sects doubtless were to be found in every populous centre where Jews congregated, and it was always in these centres of Judaism that Christianity at first found a home. St. Paul, however, saw no reason to dwell on this point at any length; the gross absurdity of such a "counsel "as a rule of life was too apparent; it was a plain contradiction of the order of Divine Providence. But the next question which presented itself in the teaching of these false ascetics, as we shall see, required more careful handling.<p><span class= "bld">And commanding to abstain from meats.</span>--Once more we must look to those famous Jewish religious communities of Egypt (the Essenes and Therapeutae), the precursors of the great monastic systems of Christianity, as the home whence these perverted ascetic tendencies issued. These precepts too, like the counsel respecting marriage, were adopted in after years by several of the principal Gnostic sects; and it was especially those times St. Paul looked on to, although, no doubt, the seeds of their false asceticism had already been sown broadcast in the principal Christian congregations.<p>It has been asked why, in these solemn warnings against a false asceticism which St. Paul foresaw might and would be substituted for a really earnest Godfearing life, the question of celibacy was dismissed with one short sentence, while the apparently less-important question of abstaining from particular kinds of food was discussed with some detail. The reason is easily discoverable. The counsel to abstain from marriage was a strange and unnatural suggestion, one contrary to the plain scheme of creation. Any teaching which taught that the celibate's life was a life peculiarly pleasing to God would, at the same time, throw a slur upon all home and family life, and the Apostle felt that men's ordinary common sense would soon relegate any such strange teaching to obscurity; but with the question of abstaining from meats--that was connected with the precepts of the Mosaic law, which dealt at some length (probably from reasons connected with the public health) with these restrictions in the matter of meats.<p>These false teachers, while they urged such abstinence as a likely way to win God's favour, would probably base, or at all events support, their arguments by reference to certain portions of the Mosaic law, rightly understood or wrongly understood.<p>These points, then, might have risen into the dignity of a controverted question between the (Pauline) Gentile and the Jewish congregations. So St. Paul at once removed it to a higher platform. All food was from the hand of one Maker--nothing, then, could really be considered common or unclean without throwing a slur upon the All-Creator.<p><span class= "bld">Which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving.</span>--God's primeval intention is thus sharply contrasted with men's arbitrary restrictions.

The word "commanding" has to be supplied from the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "commanding not." Some of the sects prohibited the use of animal food. A trace of this asceticism in regard to food is found in <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16, 21, 23</a>. (For a full list of authorities on the asceticism of the Jewish sects, see Bishop Lightfoot, 'Introduction to the Epistle to the Coloss.,' pp. 83, 84.) The chief passages relating to it are those referred to above from Josephus: <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, "They despise marriage;" <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, "<span class="accented">None</span> of the Essenes marry" (Philo, 'Fragm.,' p. 633); "Gens sine ulla femina, venere abdicata" - "A people without a single woman, for they renounce marriage" (Plin., 'Nat. Hist.,' 5:15). As regards their food, Bishop Lightfoot says, "The Essene drank no wine; he did not touch animal food. His meal consisted of a piece of bread, and a single mess of vegetables" ('Introd.,' p. 86). Professor Burton (in Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia,' art. "<span class="accented">Gnosticism</span>') says of the later Gnostics that, from their principle of the utter malignity of matter, and the elevating nature of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, two very opposite results ensued - one that many Gnostics led very profligate lives; the other that many practiced great austerities in order to mortify the body and its sensual appetites (p. 770). Some of our modern Eneratites, in their language concerning the use of wine and beer, approach Gnosticism very closely. <span class="cmt_word">To be received</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); a classical word, but only found here in the New Testament, not used by the LXX. <span class="cmt_word">With thanksgiving.</span> Observe the identity of thought with <a href="/romans/14-6.htm">Romans 14:6</a>.
