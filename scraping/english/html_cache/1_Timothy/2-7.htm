Paul is referring to the preceding verses where he discusses the universal scope of salvation and the role of Jesus as the mediator. The reason is tied to the divine plan for spreading the Gospel to all people, emphasizing the inclusivity of God's salvation.<p><b>I was appointed</b><br>Paul's appointment is a divine calling, not a self-assumed role. This reflects the biblical theme of God choosing individuals for specific purposes, as seen with prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>) and apostles like Peter. It underscores the authority and legitimacy of Paul's ministry.<p><b>as a preacher</b><br>The term "preacher" highlights Paul's role in proclaiming the Gospel. In the Greco-Roman world, heralds were official messengers, and Paul sees himself as one who announces the good news of Christ. This aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) to spread the Gospel to all nations.<p><b>an apostle</b><br>An apostle is one who is sent with a mission. Paul&#8217;s apostleship is unique as he was called by the risen Christ (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3-6</a>). This title affirms his authority and the divine origin of his message, distinguishing him from false teachers.<p><b>and a faithful and true teacher of the Gentiles</b><br>Paul's mission to the Gentiles is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). His faithfulness and truthfulness are crucial in establishing trust and credibility among the Gentile converts, contrasting with the false teachings prevalent at the time.<p><b>I am telling the truth; I am not lying about anything</b><br>This emphatic statement underscores Paul's integrity and the authenticity of his message. In a cultural context where rhetoric and persuasion were highly valued, Paul assures his readers of his sincerity, echoing his defense of his apostleship in other letters (e.g., <a href="/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The author of the letter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, who emphasizes his role and authority in spreading the Gospel, particularly to the Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>The recipient of the letter, a young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, who is being instructed on how to lead the church in Ephesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people to whom Paul was specifically called to preach the Gospel, highlighting the universal nature of the Christian message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was stationed, known for its diverse population and significant role in early Christian history.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostleship.htm">Apostleship</a></b><br>The office and calling of being an apostle, which Paul defends as divinely appointed, underscoring his authority and mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_and_calling.htm">Authority and Calling</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes his divine appointment, reminding us of the importance of recognizing and respecting God-given authority in the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/truthfulness_in_ministry.htm">Truthfulness in Ministry</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s insistence on truthfulness serves as a model for integrity in ministry, encouraging believers to be honest and transparent in their service.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/mission_to_the_gentiles.htm">Mission to the Gentiles</a></b><br>The inclusion of Gentiles highlights the universal scope of the Gospel, urging believers to embrace diversity and reach out beyond cultural boundaries.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_a_teacher.htm">Role of a Teacher</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s role as a teacher underscores the importance of sound doctrine and faithful teaching in the church, challenging leaders to be diligent in their study and instruction.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Timothy_2_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Timothy 2:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Tim_2_7_Paul_s_teacher_apostle_role.htm">How does 1 Timothy 2:7 affirm Paul's role as a teacher and apostle?

These fiery and earnest words had no private reference to <span class= "ital">him, </span>St. Paul, or to <span class= "ital">his</span> especial claims to be heard, but were uttered solely in view of the surpassing magnitude of the message with which he was charged--solely to bear a weighty and imposing testimony to the truth of his assertion, which so many were ready and eager to dispute--the assertion that the gospel of Jesus Christ was a message of glad tidings, was an offer of salvation, not to a <span class= "ital">people, </span>but to a <span class= "ital">world.</span><p><span class= "bld">A teacher of the Gentiles.</span>--This specifies more clearly the especial duties of his apostleship, not perhaps without some reference to the peculiar fitness which marked him out as the declarer of the divine will in respect to this gracious offer of redemption to the isles of the scattered countless Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">In faith and verity.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">in faith and truth.</span> These words specify the sphere in which the Apostle performed his great mission.

Or, in other words, St. Paul carried on his ceaseless labours, <span class= "ital">within</span> gathering fresh and ever fresh strength from the exhaustless spring of his own loving, mighty faith in Jesus, and <span class= "ital">without</span> appealing to the generally well-known incidents of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, the truth of which all might test. In those days there were even many <span class= "ital">eye-witnesses</span> of the Passion still living.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="accented">Was appointed</span> for <span class="accented">am ordained</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">truth</span> for <span class="accented">truth in Christ</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">I lie</span> for <span class="accented">and lie</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">truth</span> for <span class="accented">verity</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I was appointed,</span> etc. It is quite in St. Paul's manner thus to refer to his own apostolic mission (see <a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1, 17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>, etc.; <a href="/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2, 8</a>; and many other places). <span class="cmt_word">A preacher</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;</span>; as in <a href="/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11</a>).
