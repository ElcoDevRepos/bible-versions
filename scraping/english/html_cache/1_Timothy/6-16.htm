In biblical context, immortality is an attribute solely ascribed to God, distinguishing Him from all creation. Unlike humans, who are mortal and subject to death, God possesses life in Himself (<a href="/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a>). This aligns with the Old Testament understanding of God as the "Everlasting God" (<a href="/genesis/21-33.htm">Genesis 21:33</a>). The concept of immortality here underscores God's sovereignty and eternal existence, which is a foundational belief in Christian theology.<p><b>and dwells in unapproachable light</b><br>The imagery of "unapproachable light" conveys God's holiness and purity. Light is often used in Scripture to symbolize God's presence and truth (1 <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>). The idea of God dwelling in light that is unapproachable by humans highlights the separation between God's holiness and human sinfulness. This is reminiscent of Moses' encounter with God on Mount Sinai, where the glory of God was so overwhelming that Moses could not see His face (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). The light signifies God's majesty and the reverence due to Him.<p><b>No one has ever seen Him, nor can anyone see Him</b><br>This statement reflects the biblical teaching that God is spirit (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>) and invisible (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). Throughout Scripture, there are instances where God's presence is revealed through manifestations, such as the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) or the pillar of cloud and fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>), but His full essence remains unseen. This aligns with the understanding that God's nature is beyond human comprehension and visibility, reinforcing the need for faith and reverence.<p><b>To Him be honor and eternal dominion!</b><br>This doxology ascribes glory and authority to God, acknowledging His supreme power and rule over all creation. The call for honor and dominion reflects the biblical theme of God's kingship and sovereignty, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a>, which speaks of God's everlasting kingdom. This phrase serves as a reminder of the proper response to God's majesty&#8212;worship and submission to His will.<p><b>Amen</b><br>The term "Amen" is a declaration of affirmation, meaning "truly" or "so be it." It is used throughout Scripture to express agreement with God's truth and promises. In this context, it serves as a fitting conclusion to the doxology, affirming the eternal truths about God's nature and reign. The use of "Amen" connects this passage to the broader biblical tradition of affirming God's faithfulness and the certainty of His word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The verse speaks of God&#8217;s unique attributes, emphasizing His immortality and the fact that He dwells in unapproachable light.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>The recipient of the letter, a young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, who is being instructed in matters of faith and conduct.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the letter, providing guidance and theological insights to Timothy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unique_immortality.htm">God&#8217;s Unique Immortality</a></b><br>God alone possesses immortality inherently.

The symbolism of the old covenant teaches the same truth, the unapproachable glories in which God dwells; for instance, the guarding of the bounds of Sinai in the giving of the Law; the covering of the faces of the Seraphim in the year that King Uzziah died, when Isaiah saw the divine vision; the veiled darkness of the Holy of holies in the Tabernacle and the Temple, where ever and anon the visible glory dwelt.<p><span class= "bld">Whom no man hath seen, nor can see.</span>--The Old Testament teaches the same mysterious truth--"For there shall no man see me, and live" (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm" title="And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.">Exodus 33:20</a>, and also <a href="/deuteronomy/4-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only you heard a voice.">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>). <a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a> repeats this in very plain words--"No man hath seen God at any time."

The appearance of the "God of Israel" to Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, related in <a href="/exodus/34-9.htm">Exodus 34:9-11</a>, was that of the Son in anticipation of the Incarnation. The invisibility of the essential Godhead is also predicated in our Lord's saying, "God is a Spirit" (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>). This whole passage is a magnificent embodiment of the attributes of the living God, supreme blessedness and almighty power, universal dominion, and unchangeable being, inscrutable majesty, radiant holiness, and glory inaccessible and unapproachable by his creatures, save through the mediation of his only begotten Son. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/6-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[He]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
