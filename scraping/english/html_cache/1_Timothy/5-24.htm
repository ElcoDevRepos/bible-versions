In biblical context, this can be seen in the lives of individuals like Cain, whose sin of murder was immediately apparent (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8-10</a>). The cultural context of the early church emphasized community accountability, where public sins were often addressed openly (<a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-5</a>). This visibility serves as a warning and a call for repentance, aligning with the biblical principle that sin, when exposed, can lead to correction and restoration (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).<p><b>going ahead of them to judgment</b><br>This part of the verse suggests that obvious sins lead to immediate consequences or divine judgment. In the historical context of the early church, public sins could result in church discipline or social ostracism (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>). Theologically, it reflects the principle that God&#8217;s justice is inevitable and that unrepentant sin will be judged (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). This also connects to the prophetic theme of the final judgment, where all deeds will be revealed (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).<p><b>but the sins of others do not surface until later</b><br>This phrase addresses the hidden nature of some sins, which may not be immediately apparent. In biblical narratives, figures like David initially concealed his sin with Bathsheba, which only surfaced later through the prophet Nathan (<a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-14</a>). Culturally, this reflects the understanding that not all wrongdoing is visible, and some may deceive others for a time. However, scripture assures that God sees all and will bring every hidden thing to light (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). This serves as a reminder of the eventual revelation and accountability before God, emphasizing the need for personal integrity and repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and personal conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, serving in Ephesus, who is the recipient of this letter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was stationed, known for its diverse culture and challenges to early Christian teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/church_elders.htm">Church Elders</a></b><br>Leaders within the church whose conduct and character are under scrutiny in this passage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The event or process of divine evaluation of human actions, both in the present life and at the end of time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_sin.htm">The Nature of Sin</a></b><br>Sin can be both visible and hidden.

St. Paul now returns and closes the subject on which he had been instructing his representative at Ephesus. He tells him, in his choice of men to fill the public positions in the Church of God--in his public inquiries into their conduct and teaching--in his inquiries respecting sinners, who, having forfeited their position as members of the community, were seeking re-admission into church fellowship, not to forget there were <span class= "ital">two</span> classes of sins: the one class public and open, heralds, so to speak, of the judgment to follow. In the case of men sinning thus, the church's chief pastor would have no difficulty in determining upon his course of action. But there was another class of sins--silent and, as far as public and general knowledge went, unknown--only published after judgment had been given. To rightly estimate such characters will require much care and penetration, and <span class= "ital">this</span> will be part of Timothy's work. The judgment (<span class= "ital">krisis</span>) here mentioned is that of Timothy as shown in the careful selection of candidates for ordination--in determining what sinners are fit for restoration to church fellowship--in pronouncing sentence in the matter of accused presbyters.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="accented">Evident</span> for <span class="accented">open beforehand</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto</span> for <span class="accented">to</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">men also</span> for <span class="accented">men</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Some men's sins</span>, etc. St. Paul is evidently here recurring to the topic which he had been dealing with ever since ver. 17, viz. Timothy's duty as a bishop, to whom was entrusted the selection of persons for the office of elder, or presbyter, and also the maintaining of discipline among his clergy. Alford sees the connection of the precept about drinking a little wine with what went before, and with this twenty-fourth verse, in the supposed circumstance that Timothy's weak health had somewhat weakened the vigor of his rule; and that the recommendation to leave off water-drinking was given more with a view to the firmer discharge of those duties than merely for his bodily comfort. This may be so. But there is nothing unlike St. Paul's manner in the supposition that he had done with the subject in hand at the end of the twenty-second verse, and passed on to the friendly hint with regard to Timothy's health, but then subjoined the fresh remarks in vers. 24 and 25, which were an afterthought. <span class="cmt_word">Evident</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); only found in the New Testament, in <a href="/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a> besides these two verses, and in the apocryphal books of the Old Testament. It is common, with the kindred forms, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., in classical Greek. It is doubted whether <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> in this compound verb has the force of "beforehand," as in the A.V., and not rather that of "before the eyes of all," and therefore only intensifies the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>. But the natural force of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> in composition certainly is "before" in point of time; and hence in a compound like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> would mean" evident before it is examined," which of course is equivalent to "very evident." St. Paul's meaning, therefore, would be: Some men's sins are notorious, requiring no careful inquisition in order to find them out; nay, they of themselves go before - before the sinner himself - unto judgment. But there are also some whose sins follow after them. It is not till after close inquiry that they are found out. They go up to the judgment-seat apparently innocent, but after a while their sins come trooping up to their condemnation. This enforces the caution, "Lay hands hastily on no man." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/5-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
