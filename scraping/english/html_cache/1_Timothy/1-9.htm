The righteous, those who live by faith and are guided by the Holy Spirit, do not need the law to dictate their actions because their lives naturally align with God's will. This echoes <a href="/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a>, where Paul emphasizes that faith upholds the law, and <a href="/galatians/5-18.htm">Galatians 5:18</a>, which states that those led by the Spirit are not under the law.<p><b>but for the lawless and rebellious</b><br>The law is necessary for those who reject authority and live in opposition to God's commands. The term "lawless" refers to those who act without regard for God's laws, while "rebellious" indicates a willful defiance against divine authority. This reflects the condition of humanity described in <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18-32</a>, where people suppress the truth and live in unrighteousness.<p><b>for the ungodly and sinful</b><br>"Ungodly" describes those who live without reverence for God, while "sinful" refers to those who actively engage in actions contrary to God's commands. This distinction highlights the breadth of human sinfulness addressed by the law. <a href="/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6-8</a> speaks to Christ's sacrifice for the ungodly, emphasizing God's love and the need for redemption.<p><b>for the unholy and profane</b><br>"Unholy" refers to those who are impure or desecrate what is sacred, while "profane" indicates a lack of respect for what is holy. This reflects the Old Testament's emphasis on holiness, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>, where God calls His people to be holy as He is holy. The law serves to protect the sanctity of what God has declared sacred.<p><b>for killers of father or mother</b><br>This phrase highlights the severity of certain sins that the law addresses, specifically those that violate the commandment to honor one's parents (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). Such acts are seen as particularly heinous, reflecting a deep moral corruption. The inclusion of this sin underscores the law's role in maintaining social order and familial respect.<p><b>for murderers</b><br>Murder is a direct violation of the commandment "You shall not murder" (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>). The law serves to restrain such acts of violence and uphold the sanctity of life, which is created in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>).

Only in Jesus can the unrighteous become righteous, living freely in the Spirit rather than under the law&#8217;s penalty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_timothy/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Knowing this.</span>--The teacher of the Law, being aware of this great truth, now to be detailed--viz.:--<p><span class= "bld">That the law is not made for a righteous man.</span>--The stern Mosaic Law was enacted centuries before the Messiah Jesus had given to men His new Law. The Law of Moses was not, then, enacted for a "righteous man"--that is, for a Christian in the true sense of the word, who has sought and found justification by faith in Jesus, and who, sanctified by the Holy Ghost, is living a new life. In other words, the "teacher," Paul says, must teach the flock of Ephesus (1) the true use of the <span class= "ital">prohibitions</span> of the Law, viz., that they served to convince a man of his hopeless condition; they showed him he was a slave to sin, from which wretched bondage, the Law, which made him bitterly conscious of his condition, gave him no assistance to free himself; (2) the "teacher" was to press home to the people that the Law, good though it was, if used as a means to open men's eyes to see their true condition, was not made for <span class= "ital">them</span> if they were reckoned among the righteous--that is, if they had found acceptance in the Redeemer. In the case of these justified and sanctified ones the moral law was written in their hearts and was embodied in their lives.<p><span class= "bld">But for the lawless.</span>--Now the Law was not made for the holy and humble men of heart, whom St. Paul trusted formed the main body of the congregation of believers in Ephesus, and in every city where men and women were found who called on the name of the Lord Jesus, and who struggled to follow their dear Master's footsteps. It was made centuries before Jesus of Nazareth walked on earth, as a great protest against the every-day vices which dishonoured Israel in common with the rest of mankind. The terrible enumeration of sins and sinners in these 9th and 10th verses, while following the order of the ancient Tables of Sinai, seems to allude pointedly to the vices especially prevalent in that day in the great centres of the Roman empire.<p><span class= "bld">And disobedient.</span>--More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">unruly, </span>or <span class= "ital">insubordinate.</span><p><span class= "bld">For the ungodly and for sinners.</span>--These four terms with which the Apostle opens his sad list of those for whom the Law was enacted, generally denote those who care nothing for human law, and who despise all obedience; who to their careless neglect for all constituted authorities, unite irreligion and contempt for all sacred things.<p><span class= "bld">For unholy and profane.</span>--The persons designated in these terms are those wanting in inner purity--men who scoff at holiness of life and character in its deepest sense. These six classes may be assumed in general terms to include the prohibitions of the first four Commandments (the First Table, as it is termed), where sins against God are especially dwelt upon. The sins against man, which form the subject of the prohibitions of the Second Table (Commandments Five to Ten), are included in the following enumeration of wrong-doers.<p><span class= "bld">For murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers.</span>--The original Greek expressions here require the milder rendering, <span class= "ital">smiters of fathers and smiters of mothers, </span>and refer to persons of various ages who refuse all reverence, even all kindly treatment, to their parents. The words of the Fifth Commandment exactly explain this unnatural conduct.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="accented">As knowing</span> for <span class="accented">knowing</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Law</span> for <span class="accented">the Law</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unruly</span> for <span class="accented">disobedient</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and sinners</span> for <span class="accented">and for sinners</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the unholy</span> for <span class="accented">unholy</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Law is not made for a righteous man.</span> It is much better to render <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, with the A.V., "the Law," as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12-14</a>.

That <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> here means the Law of Moses is further evident from this, that in the following list the apostle clearly follows the general order of the Decalogue, taking first the offences against the first table, and then sins against the fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth commandments (compare, too, ver. 11 with <a href="/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lawless</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); with no special reference to its etymology, but meaning simply "transgressors," "wicked," as <a href="/luke/22-37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>; <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a> (A.V.), and very frequently in the LXX. <span class="cmt_word">Unruly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); insubordinate, resisting lawful authority.
