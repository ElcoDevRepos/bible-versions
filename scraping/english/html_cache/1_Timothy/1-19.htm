In the early church, faith was not merely intellectual assent but a deep trust in God and His promises, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>. A good conscience refers to an inner sense of right and wrong, informed by the Holy Spirit and the teachings of Scripture. Paul often stresses the importance of a clear conscience in his letters (<a href="/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/3-9.htm">1 Timothy 3:9</a>), indicating that it is crucial for effective ministry and personal holiness. The dual emphasis on faith and conscience suggests that true Christian living involves both correct belief and ethical behavior.<p><b>which some have rejected</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the reality of apostasy, where individuals deliberately turn away from the faith they once professed. The term "rejected" implies a willful decision to abandon the truth, reminiscent of the warnings in <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-6</a> about falling away after having received the knowledge of the truth. In the historical context of the early church, false teachings and heresies were prevalent, and some believers were swayed by these errors (<a href="/2_timothy/2-17.htm">2 Timothy 2:17-18</a>). This rejection is not merely passive but an active choice against the faith and moral standards they once held.<p><b>and thereby shipwrecked their faith</b><br>The metaphor of shipwreck conveys a vivid image of total ruin and disaster. In the ancient world, shipwrecks were common and often resulted in loss of life and cargo, symbolizing the severe consequences of abandoning faith. Paul himself experienced literal shipwrecks (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>), making this metaphor particularly poignant. The imagery suggests that just as a ship must navigate carefully to avoid destruction, so must believers guard their faith and conscience to avoid spiritual ruin. This warning is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>, which cautions believers to take heed lest they fall. The shipwreck of faith serves as a solemn reminder of the dangers of straying from the truth and the necessity of perseverance in the Christian life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and personal conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, entrusted with the leadership of the church in Ephesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was stationed, known for its diverse culture and challenges to Christian teaching.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hymenaeus_and_alexander.htm">Hymenaeus and Alexander</a></b><br>Individuals mentioned later in the chapter as examples of those who have "shipwrecked their faith."<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>The broader body of believers who are the recipients of Paul's teachings through Timothy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_faith_and_conscience.htm">The Importance of Faith and Conscience</a></b><br>Faith and a good conscience are foundational to a stable Christian life.

In the mind of St. Paul, "want of faith" was no mere refusal to accept a definite religions dogma, but was ever closely connected with impurity and the love of sin. If a man dares <span class= "ital">to</span> do wilful violence to his better nature he must not presume to dream of <span class= "ital">faith</span> saving him. The thought expressed by another inspired teacher seems to run constantly in the mind of St. Paul: "The devils also <span class= "ital">believe</span> and tremble."<p><span class= "bld">Which some.</span>--"Some."
