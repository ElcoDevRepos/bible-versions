The advice to remarry aligns with cultural norms of the time, where marriage was seen as a primary means of provision and protection for women. This counsel also reflects the biblical view of marriage as a sacred institution (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). Paul's guidance here is consistent with his other teachings on marriage, such as in <a href="/1_corinthians/7.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>, where he discusses the benefits of marriage for those who might struggle with self-control.<p><b>have children</b><br>Bearing children was highly valued in Jewish and early Christian cultures, seen as a blessing from God (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>). This directive also serves a practical purpose, as children could provide support and care for their parents in old age. The emphasis on family aligns with the biblical mandate to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). Additionally, raising children in the faith contributes to the growth and strength of the Christian community.<p><b>and manage their households</b><br>Managing a household was a significant responsibility in the ancient world, involving not only domestic duties but also the moral and spiritual upbringing of the family. This role is affirmed in <a href="/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, which describes the virtuous woman as one who diligently oversees her household. The management of a home is seen as a noble task, reflecting the order and stewardship God desires in all aspects of life.<p><b>denying the adversary occasion for slander</b><br>The "adversary" here can be understood as both human critics and spiritual forces opposed to the church. By living respectable and orderly lives, younger widows would prevent any opportunity for outsiders to criticize or malign the Christian community. This echoes the broader biblical theme of living above reproach (<a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>) and maintaining a good witness to the world (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>).

Paul has already noted that youthful desires and pressures can tempt them toward &#8220;idle talk&#8221; and &#8220;following Satan&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-11.htm">1 Timothy 5:11&#8211;13</a>).

Paul&#8217;s earlier reminder that women &#8220;will be saved through childbearing&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-15.htm">1 Timothy 2:15</a>) underscores the sanctifying effect of nurturing life and faith in the home (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>; <a href="/titus/2-4.htm">Titus 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>manage their households</b><p>Home management is active stewardship, not passive confinement.

In doing so they honor God, strengthen the church, and display a living testimony that turns potential slander into praise for the gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_timothy/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house.</span>--Here the Apostle deliberately expresses his <span class= "ital">will</span> that in these Christian communities the younger widows should not, in the first fervour of their zeal, when borne down by sorrow, attempt anything like an ascetic life, which they would probably tire of after a season; they would thus, in the long run, instead of benefiting, positively injure the cause of Christ. St. Paul's practical mind, guided by the Spirit of God, has left us no impossible rules of perfection, no exaggerated praises of asceticism, of lofty self-denial, no passionate exhortings to a life made up entirely of self-sacrifice and of self-surrender.<p>He knew the ordinary man or woman was incapable of such exalted heroism, and therefore was too wise, too loving, even to recommend a life which few could live. It was not that the Master, Christ, and the greatest of his servants, St. Paul, did not themselves prize and admire the higher ideal and the nobler life--for was it not their own? Did not one attain to it, and the other die in his hero-efforts to reach it? But Master and scholar in their gospel of the world have left commands that all, not the few, can obey--have enjoined a life which all, not the few, may live.<p><span class= "bld">Give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.</span>--The reference here is not to the devil--as would at first appear probable from the direct reference in the next verse--but to the enemy of Christ--the sneering worldly man, who, jealous of a faith which he declines to receive, and envious of a life in which he will not share, is always on the look-out to discover flaws and failings in the avowed professors of a religion which he hates.

The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> which precedes is a further proof that this direction or command of the apostle's springs from what he had just been saying about the young widows, and therefore that what follows relates to them, and not to women generally. In order to avoid the scandal mentioned in ver. 11 of the young widows first dedicating their widowhood to Christ, and then drawing back and marrying, he directs that they should follow the natural course and marry, in doing which they would be blameless. <span class="cmt_word">Bear children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>): here only in the New Testament or LXX.; but <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs in <a href="/1_timothy/2-15.htm">1 Timothy 2:15</a> (where see note). <span class="cmt_word">Rule the household</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>; here only in this sense); act the part of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, the mistress of a family (Plutarch and elsewhere). <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> frequent in the New Testament, and kindred words are used in classical Greek. <span class="cmt_word">For reviling</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>).
