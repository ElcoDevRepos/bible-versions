The terms "labor" and "strive" suggest a continuous and strenuous effort, akin to an athlete training for a competition. This reflects the Apostle Paul's own ministry, characterized by hard work and perseverance (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>). The Greek word for "strive" (agonizomai) implies a struggle or fight, indicating the spiritual warfare believers face (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). The context of 1 Timothy is Paul's instruction to Timothy on leading the church, highlighting the need for diligence in teaching and upholding sound doctrine.<p><b>because we have set our hope on the living God</b><br>The phrase "living God" contrasts with the dead idols worshiped in the Greco-Roman world, affirming the active and dynamic nature of the God of Israel. This hope is not wishful thinking but a confident expectation based on God's faithfulness and promises (<a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>). The living God is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing His eternal existence and involvement in human affairs (<a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>, <a href="/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15</a>). This hope motivates believers to endure hardships, knowing their labor is not in vain (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).<p><b>who is the Savior of everyone</b><br>This statement underscores the universal scope of God's salvation. While not implying universalism, it reflects God's desire for all to be saved (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>) and the provision of salvation through Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). The term "Savior" is significant in the Roman context, where emperors were often hailed as saviors. Paul reaffirms that true salvation comes only from God, who offers redemption to all humanity (<a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11</a>).<p><b>and especially of those who believe</b><br>This clarifies that while salvation is available to all, it is effective specifically for those who have faith in Jesus Christ. Belief is the means by which individuals receive God's saving grace (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). This distinction highlights the necessity of personal faith and the transformative relationship between the believer and God. The phrase also reflects the biblical theme of the remnant, where a faithful group within a larger community experiences God's promises (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and personal conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, serving in Ephesus, who is the recipient of this epistle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was ministering, known for its diverse culture and challenges to Christian teaching.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/living_god.htm">Living God</a></b><br>A reference to the active and true God, contrasting with dead idols, emphasizing His ongoing relationship with believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those who have faith in Jesus Christ, receiving special emphasis in this verse as recipients of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_anchored_in_the_living_god.htm">Hope Anchored in the Living God</a></b><br>Our hope is not in temporal things but in the eternal, living God who actively works in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_offer_of_salvation.htm">Universal Offer of Salvation</a></b><br>While God is the Savior of all, salvation is particularly effective for those who believe, highlighting the necessity of faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/labor_and_striving_in_faith.htm">Labor and Striving in Faith</a></b><br>The Christian life involves active effort and perseverance, motivated by our hope in God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/special_relationship_with_believers.htm">Special Relationship with Believers</a></b><br>While God's salvation is available to all, believers enjoy a unique relationship with Him, marked by faith and trust.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_ministry.htm">Encouragement in Ministry</a></b><br>Like Timothy, we are called to labor and strive in our faith, knowing that our efforts are grounded in the hope of the living God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Timothy_4_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Timothy 4:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Tim_4_10_Why_trust_the_living_God.htm">How does 1 Timothy 4:10 encourage us to trust in the living God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_Savior_of_all_men.htm">What does "Savior of all men" mean in the context of 1 Timothy 4:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_labor_and_strive_daily.htm">How can we implement "labor and strive" in our daily Christian walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_Tim_4_10_John_3_16_on_salvation.htm">How does 1 Timothy 4:10 connect with John 3:16 about God's salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_hope_in_God_during_challenges.htm">How can we apply "hope in the living God" during challenging times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Timothy_4_10_Savior_of_all_people.htm">How does 1 Timothy 4:10 define "Savior of all people" in a Christian context?

We know that the promise made will be fulfilled, because the God on whom--as on a sure foundation--our hopes rest, is a <span class= "ital">living</span> God. "Living," in strong contrast to those dumb and lifeless idols shrined in the well-known Ephesian temples.<p><span class= "bld">Who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</span>--These words, like the assertion of <a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm" title="Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.">1Timothy 2:4</a>, have been often pressed into the service of that school of kindly, but mistaken, interpreters, who ignore, or explain away, the plain doctrine of Holy Scripture which tells us there are those whose destruction from the presence of the Lord shall be everlasting, whose portion shall be the "second death" (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;">2Thessalonians 1:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>). These interpreters prefer to substitute in place of this terrible, but <span class= "ital">repeated</span> declaration, their own perilous theories of universalism. Here the gracious words seem to affix a seal to the statement immediately preceding, which speaks of "the hope in the living God" as the source of all the labour and brave patience of the Lord's true servants. The <span class= "ital">living</span> God is also a <span class= "ital">loving</span> God, the Saviour of <span class= "ital">all, </span>if they would receive Him, and, undoubtedly, the Redeemer of those who accept His love and are faithful to His holy cause.<p>It must be borne in mind that there were many Hebrews still in every Christian congregation, many in every church, who still clung with passionate zeal to the old loved Hebrew thought, that Messiah's work of salvation was limited to the chosen race. This and similar sayings were specially meant to set aside for ever these narrow and selfish conceptions of the Redeemer's will; were intended to show these exclusive children of Israel that Christ's work would stretch over a greater and a grander platform than ever Israel could fill; were designed to tell out to all the churches how indeed "it was a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel." Still, with all these guarded considerations, which serve to warn us from entertaining any hopes of a universal redemption, such a saying as this seems to point to the blessed Atonement mystery as performing a work whose consequences reach far beyond the limits of human thought, or even of sober speculation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - To <span class="accented">this end</span> for <span class="accented">therefore</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">labor and strive</span> for <span class="accented">both labor and suffer reproach</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">have our hope set on</span> for <span class="accented">trust in</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">them</span> for <span class="accented">those</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">For to this end</span>; or, <span class="accented">with this in view</span>.

The sense of the T.R., "suffer reproach," seems preferable, and the expression more forcible, as conveying something more than mere labor - the bitter reproaches and persecutions which he endured (<a href="/2_timothy/3-11.htm">2 Timothy 3:11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-9.htm">1 Corinthians 4:9-13</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>); and all because of his firm trust in the promises of the living God. <span class="cmt_word">Our hope set on.</span> Rather a clumsy phrase, though it expresses accurately the <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>; but it was hardly worth altering the A.V., "we trust in the living God."
