This reflects the spiritual fatherhood Paul has over Timothy, who is his prot&#233;g&#233; in ministry. The use of "child" underscores the nurturing and guiding role Paul plays, similar to how God is often depicted as a father to His people (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>).<p><b>I entrust you with this command</b><br>Paul is passing on a significant responsibility to Timothy, emphasizing the trust and authority he places in him. This command likely refers to the instructions given earlier in the letter, particularly concerning the defense of sound doctrine and the refutation of false teachings (<a href="/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3-7</a>). The concept of entrusting is akin to a sacred deposit, a theme seen throughout the pastoral epistles (<a href="/2_timothy/1-14.htm">2 Timothy 1:14</a>).<p><b>in keeping with the previous prophecies about you</b><br>This phrase suggests that Timothy's role and mission were affirmed through prophetic words, possibly during his commissioning or ordination (<a href="/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>). Prophecy in the early church served as a means of divine guidance and confirmation of God's calling. This aligns with the Old Testament practice where prophets would anoint and confirm leaders (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12-13</a>).<p><b>so that by them you may fight the good fight</b><br>The imagery of warfare is used to describe the Christian life and ministry, highlighting the spiritual battle against false teachings and moral decay. This metaphor is consistent with Paul's other writings, such as <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where believers are urged to put on the full armor of God.

The sum of it was that men should put their whole trust in Him who came into the world to save sinners, and who alone was able to lead them into everlasting life. There is something very solemn in St. Paul's pressing home this charge to Timothy, and invoking the memory of the prophecies which went before on him. The charge was the last precious heritage, the priceless treasure which the old master, feeling that for him the end was not far distant, would leave to his favourite disciple--his own dear son in the faith. Anxious above measure for the loved group of Asian churches, of which Ephesus was the centre, foreseeing that the present perils and dangers from within and without would rapidly close round the congregations, and placing his greatest earthly hope on the steadfastness and knowledge of his own dear disciple whom he had left there as a shepherd to the sheep, he charges his son Timothy, by the memory of those strange prophetic utterances which, years before, had been made over him (<a href="/context/acts/17-1.htm" title="Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:">Acts 17:1-2</a>) in Lystra or Derbe, and which, perhaps, had first induced him to choose the young son of Eunice as his friend and companion, to hold fast the blessed doctrine which taught men to put their whole trust in Jesus Christ.<p><span class= "bld">According to the prophecies which went before on thee.</span>--These prophetic utterances seem to have been not unfrequent in the days of the Apostles, and were among the precious gifts which enriched and encouraged the Church of the first days.

Omitting the long digression in vers. 5-17, the sense runs clearly thus: "As I besought thee to tarry at Ephesus in order that thou mightest charge some not to teach a different doctrine, so now do I place this charge in thy hands, according to the prophecies which pointed to thee, that thou mayest war the good warfare according to the tenor of them." He thus adds that he entrusted this charge to Timothy, not <span class="accented">mero</span> <span class="accented">motu</span>, but according to direct indications of the Holy Ghost, through the prophets of the Church, which pointed out Timothy as the person who was to war that good warfare. The words, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, might possibly depend upon <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, meaning that those prophecies had this end in pointing to Timothy, viz. that he might war the good warfare, that he might be placed in the difficult post of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> follows rather more naturally in this case. But it is, perhaps, better to take them as dependent upon <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>By them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). Here <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> may be either the <span class="accented">causae efficiens</span>, indicating that by the influence of these prophecies Timothy would war the good warfare, or be equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>, "according to" (see Schleusner's 'Lexicon'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_timothy/1-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Timothy,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#953;&#956;&#972;&#952;&#949;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Timothee)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5095.htm">Strong's 5095: </a> </span><span class="str2">Timothy, a Christian of Lystra, helper of Paul.
