The Greek word for "eagerly expect" (apokaradokia) suggests an intense focus and longing. This expectation is rooted in faith, similar to the hope expressed in <a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>, where creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the children of God. Paul's hope is not wishful thinking but a firm assurance based on God's promises.<p><b>that I will in no way be ashamed</b><br>Paul's concern about being ashamed is tied to his desire to faithfully represent Christ. In the cultural context of honor and shame in the Greco-Roman world, being ashamed would mean failing to uphold the gospel's truth. This echoes <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, where Paul declares he is not ashamed of the gospel. His confidence is in God's power to sustain him, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12</a>.<p><b>but will have complete boldness</b><br>Boldness here refers to the courage to speak and act according to one's convictions. In <a href="/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29</a>, the early Christians prayed for boldness to proclaim the word despite persecution. Paul's boldness is a result of the Holy Spirit's work within him, enabling him to face trials without fear, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19-20</a>.<p><b>so that now as always</b><br>This phrase indicates consistency in Paul's life and ministry. His commitment to Christ is unwavering, regardless of circumstances. This consistency is a hallmark of Christian discipleship, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>, where believers are encouraged to be steadfast and immovable in their work for the Lord.<p><b>Christ will be exalted in my body</b><br>Paul's ultimate goal is to glorify Christ through his physical existence. This reflects the biblical theme of the body as a temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>). Whether through suffering or service, Paul's life is a testament to Christ's lordship, similar to how Jesus glorified the Father through His earthly ministry (<a href="/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>).<p><b>whether by life or by death</b><br>Paul acknowledges that exalting Christ may come through living or dying. This dual possibility highlights his readiness to serve Christ in any circumstance. <a href="/philippians/1-21.htm">Philippians 1:21</a> further explains this mindset: "For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain." This reflects the Christian belief in eternal life and the hope of resurrection, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, writing from prison, expressing his deep commitment to Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.

It implies an intense and almost painful longing for some crisis, a dulness of suspense lighted up with hope. The phrase is one of the many indications that the joyful and confident tone so often noticed in this Epistle came not from the absence of yearning for the freedom and activity of apostolic life, but from the victory over such longings through faith. Whatever the crisis might be, St. Paul looked eagerly for it.<p><span class= "bld">In nothing I shall be ashamed.</span>--The phrase is elsewhere used by St. Paul with especial reference to the shame which comes from hopes disappointed and professions unfulfilled. (See <a href="/2_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.">2Corinthians 7:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-4.htm" title="Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, you) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.">2Corinthians 9:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-8.htm" title="For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:">2Corinthians 10:8</a>. Compare also the quotation from <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a> in <a href="/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm" title="Why also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.">1Peter 2:6</a>.) For (he says) "hope (fulfilled) maketh not ashamed" (<a href="/romans/5-5.htm" title="And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.">Romans 5:5</a>). So probably here; he trusts that in the hour of trial the confidence which he has felt and professed of being "able to do all things through Christ who strengthenth him" (see <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm" title="I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.">Philippians 4:13</a>) may not come to shameful failure, but may "magnify Christ in all boldness of speech." There is a subtle touch of true Christian feeling in the fact that, when he speaks of the chance of failure, he uses the first person: "I shall be ashamed;" but when of triumph, it is "Christ shall be magnified" in me. If he fails, it must be through his own fault; if he triumphs, it will be through his Master's strength. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed</span>. The Greek word for "earnest expectation," which occurs also in <a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>, means literally, a watching with outstretched head, with the attention concentrated on one object, and turned away from all others. Neither his sufferings nor the opposition of the Judaizers will put him to shame. <span class="cmt_word">But that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</span> <span class="accented">After</span> " <span class="accented">boldness"</span> (<span class="accented">literally</span>, <span class="accented">boldness of speech</span>) we should expect the active form, "I shall magnify." St. Paul, in his humility, prefers the pasture, "Christ shall be magnified." Boldness of speech was to be his part, the glory should be Christ's. Whatever the issue might be, whether a life of Christian labor or a martyr's death, it would be well. The apostles were not omniscient, says Bengel, in relation to their own future lot; they lived in faith and hope. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/1-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(mou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
