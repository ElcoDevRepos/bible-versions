The "highest place" refers to the supreme position of authority and honor in the universe, seated at the right hand of God (<a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-21</a>).

This declaration is central to Christian confession and worship, as seen in <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>, where acknowledging Jesus as Lord is essential for salvation.

It raises Him to the throne of the Mediatorial kingdom, on which He entered by the Ascension, sitting at the right hand of God till He has put all enemies under His feet, and then ready "to deliver up the kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all." (See <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24-28</a>.) For it is the "Son of Man" who "cometh in the clouds of heaven" (<a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-64.htm" title="Jesus said to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.">Matthew 26:64</a>), and has "authority to execute judgment" (<a href="/john/5-27.htm" title="And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.">John 5:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Hath given him a name.</span>--Or, rather, <span class= "ital">the Name above every name.</span> "The Name" (for this seems to be the best reading) is clearly "the Name" of God. It is properly the name Jehovah, held in the extremest literal reverence by the Jews, and it came to signify (almost like "the Word") the revelation of the presence of God. See <a href="/context/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12-13</a>, where "the name which no man knew but Himself" is the "Word of God." This is, indeed, made clear by the following verse; for the adoration there described is in the original passage (<a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm" title="I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.">Isaiah 45:23</a>; comp. <a href="/romans/14-11.htm" title="For it is written, As I live, said the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.">Romans 14:11</a>), claimed as the sole due of God Himself. The name JESUS, "Jehovah the Saviour" (like "Jehovah our Righteousness," in <a href="/jeremiah/23-6.htm" title="In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.">Jeremiah 23:6</a>), does contain, as an integral element, the incommunicable name of God, while the addition of "Saviour" points to the true humanity. Therefore in that Name, of Him who is at once God and Man, "every knee is to bow" with direct worship to Him. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him</span>.

This seems to mean, not the name Jesus, which was given him at his circumcision, in accordance with the angel's message; but the name Lord or Jehovah (comp. Ver. 11), which was indeed his before his incarnation, but was given (comp. <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth") to Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son, God and Man in one Person. Or more probably, perhaps, the word "Name" is used here, as so often in the Hebrew Scriptures, for the majesty, glory, dignity, of the Godhead.

So Gesenius, in his Hebrew lexicon on the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> he explains the Name of the Lord as (b) Jehovah as being called on and praised by men; and (c) the Deity as being present with mortals (comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/2-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(Dio)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1352.htm">Strong's 1352: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wherefore, on which account, therefore.
