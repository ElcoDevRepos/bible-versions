This struggle refers to the trials and tribulations that come with living a faithful Christian life in a predominantly pagan society. The early church often faced hostility from both Jewish and Roman authorities, as well as from local populations who viewed the new faith as a threat to traditional religious practices. This struggle is a common theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>, which states that all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.<p><b>you saw I had</b><br>Paul is referring to the persecution he endured during his time in Philippi, as recorded in <a href="/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16-40</a>. He and Silas were imprisoned after casting a spirit of divination out of a slave girl, which angered her owners. This event led to their public beating and imprisonment, demonstrating the physical and social challenges faced by early Christians. The Philippians were eyewitnesses to these events, which served as a powerful testimony to the cost of discipleship and the reality of spiritual warfare.<p><b>and now hear that I still have</b><br>At the time of writing, Paul was imprisoned in Rome, as indicated in <a href="/philippians/1-13.htm">Philippians 1:13</a>. His ongoing struggles were well-known among the early Christian communities, serving as a testament to his unwavering commitment to the Gospel. This phrase highlights the continuity of Paul's trials, emphasizing that suffering for Christ is not a one-time event but an ongoing reality for believers. It also serves as an encouragement to the Philippians, showing that enduring hardship is part of the Christian journey, as echoed in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>,
