Timothy was a trusted companion and co-worker of Paul, often serving as his emissary. This reflects the close relationship between Paul and Timothy, as well as the trust Paul had in him to represent his teachings and care for the churches. The act of sending Timothy underscores the importance of personal communication and pastoral care in the early church.<p><b>as soon as I see what happens with me</b><br>Paul is writing from prison, likely in Rome, and is awaiting the outcome of his trial. This phrase indicates the uncertainty of his situation and his desire to ensure the Philippians are cared for regardless of his personal circumstances. It highlights the early Christian community's reliance on apostolic leadership and the challenges faced by the apostles. The phrase also reflects Paul's faith and patience, trusting in God's plan while being proactive in his ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Philippians.
