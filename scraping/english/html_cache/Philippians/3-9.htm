In the context of Philippians, Paul is expressing his desire to be intimately connected with Jesus. This union is a central theme in Pauline theology, as seen in <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, where Paul states, "I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me." The idea of being "found in Him" suggests a deep, abiding relationship that transcends mere external adherence to religious practices.<p><b>not having my own righteousness from the law</b><br>Paul contrasts the righteousness that comes from the law with the righteousness that comes through faith. Historically, the Jewish law was seen as a means to achieve righteousness, but Paul argues that true righteousness cannot be attained through human effort or adherence to the law. This reflects the broader New Testament teaching that the law serves to reveal sin (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>) but cannot save. Paul's own background as a Pharisee (<a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>) underscores his understanding of the limitations of the law.<p><b>but that which is through faith in Christ</b><br>Here, Paul introduces the concept of righteousness through faith, a cornerstone of Christian doctrine. This righteousness is not earned but is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ. This echoes the teaching in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which emphasizes salvation by grace through faith, not by works. The phrase underscores the transformative power of faith in Christ, which brings about a new standing before God.<p><b>the righteousness from God on the basis of faith</b><br>This final phrase encapsulates the doctrine of justification by faith. The righteousness that believers receive is not their own but is imputed to them by God. This is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, such as in <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>, where the suffering servant makes many righteous. The concept of imputed righteousness is further elaborated in <a href="/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a>, where Paul discusses Abraham's faith being credited as righteousness. This righteousness is a divine gift, highlighting God's grace and the believer's reliance on faith rather than works.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, Paul is writing from prison, expressing his deep theological insights and personal reflections on his relationship with Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.

It is a righteousness resulting from the works of the Law (<a href="/galatians/2-16.htm" title="Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.">Galatians 2:16</a>), earned by an obedience to the Law, which is "mine own"--"not of grace, but of debt" (<a href="/romans/4-4.htm" title="Now to him that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.">Romans 4:4</a>)--such as St. Paul declares (in <a href="/context/romans/10-3.htm" title="For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.">Romans 10:3-6</a>) to have been blindly sought by Israel, which he there defines as "life by doing the things of the Law." We have here, and in the following words, a remarkable link of connection with the earlier Epistles of the Judaising controversy, corresponding to <a href="/context/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>, but cast more nearly in the ancient mould. Yet it is, after all, only the last echo of the old controversy, which we trace so clearly in the Galatian and Roman Epistles. The battle is now virtually won, and it only needs to complete the victory.<p><span class= "bld">But . . . the righteousness which is of God by</span> (<span class= "ital">on condition of</span>) <span class= "bld">faith.</span>--This verse is notable, as describing the true righteousness; first imperfectly, as coming "through faith of Jesus Christ," a description which discloses to us only its means, and not its origin; next, completely, as "a righteousness coming from God on the sole condition of faith"--faith being here viewed not as the means, but as the condition, of receiving the divine gift (as in <a href="/acts/3-16.htm" title="And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know: yes, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.">Acts 3:16</a>). It may be noted that in the Epistle to the Romans, we have righteousness "through faith," "from faith," "of faith;" for there it was needful to bring out in various forms the importance of faith. Here, now that the urgent necessity has passed, we have the stress laid simply on the opposition of the gift of God through Christ to the merit of the works of the Law; and faith occupies a less prominent, though not less indispensable, position. (See <a href="/context/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>, and Note thereon.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And be found in him; now, at the last day, always</span>. <span class="accented">In Christ</span>; a member, that is, of his body, a living branch of the true Vine. <span class="cmt_word">Not having mine own righteousness, which is of the Law</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">not harding a righteousness of mine</span> own, <span class="accented">even that which is of the Law.

Greek, "upon faith," based upon faith, or on condition of faith. St. Paul speaks of "having" this righteousness. Then it is his; yet it is not any righteousness of his own, "Not by works of righteousness which we have done;" but a righteousness of God given to him, merited, not by his works, but by the perfect obedience and the precious death of Christ, and granted unto all who are found in Christ. It comes from God, the one only Giver of all good things; it is obtained through faith as the instrument or means; and it is given on that faith - on condition, that is, of a living faith abiding in the soul. Thus St. Paul states incidentally, but simply and forcibly, the great doctrine of justification by faith. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/3-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">be found</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#949;&#952;&#8182;</span> <span class="translit">(heureth&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Subjunctive Passive - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2147.htm">Strong's 2147: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary heuro, which heureo is used for it in all the tenses except the present and imperfect to find.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
