Paul often uses "brothers" to address fellow believers, emphasizing the familial bond within the Christian community. This reflects the early church's emphasis on unity and mutual support, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>.<p><b>Whatever is true</b><br>Truth is a central theme in Scripture, with Jesus Himself declaring, "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). In a world filled with deception, believers are called to focus on what aligns with God's truth, as revealed in His Word. This echoes the call to discernment found in 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>.<p><b>Whatever is honorable</b><br>Honor involves integrity and respectability. In the Greco-Roman world, honor was a key social value, often associated with public reputation. For Christians, true honor is rooted in living a life that reflects God's character, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-21.htm">Proverbs 21:21</a>.<p><b>Whatever is right</b><br>Righteousness is a foundational biblical principle, often linked with justice and moral integrity. The call to think on what is right aligns with the biblical mandate to pursue justice and righteousness, as highlighted in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>.<p><b>Whatever is pure</b><br>Purity, both moral and spiritual, is a recurring theme in Scripture. It involves being free from sin and corruption. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God," emphasizing the importance of inner purity.<p><b>Whatever is lovely</b><br>The term "lovely" refers to that which is pleasing and beautiful, often associated with God's creation and His attributes. This reflects the biblical appreciation for beauty, as seen in the Psalms, where creation's beauty points to the Creator (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>).<p><b>Whatever is admirable</b><br>Admirable qualities are those worthy of respect and commendation. This aligns with the biblical call to live lives that are above reproach, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, where leaders are called to be "above reproach."<p><b>If anything is excellent or praiseworthy</b><br>Excellence and praiseworthiness are attributes that reflect God's nature. Believers are encouraged to pursue excellence in all things, as seen in <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>, "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord."<p><b>Think on these things</b><br>The call to meditate on these virtues emphasizes the importance of the mind in spiritual growth. This aligns with <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, which urges believers to be transformed by the renewing of their minds, highlighting the transformative power of focusing on godly virtues.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, writing from prison to encourage and instruct the believers in Philippi.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia, where the first European church was established by Paul.

The exhortation is marked by the reiteration of affectionate earnestness, in which, however, we may (as always) trace an underlying method. In each pair of epithets there seems to be reference both to an inner reality and to the outward development, by which it is at once manifested and perfected. In both St. Paul would have them grow up to perfection.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">True . . .</span> <span class= "bld">honest</span> (better, <span class= "ital">venerable;</span> see margin).--Truth is the inherent likeness to God, who is Truth.

"Lovely" is that which deserves love. The phrase "of good report" represents a Greek word which is commonly used for "fair-sounding," or "auspicious" and "acceptable." It is therefore the outward expression of what is "lovely," winning the acceptance which loveliness deserves.<p><span class= "bld">If there be any virtue, and . . . praise.</span>--Still there is the same antithesis--"virtue" is the inherent quality; "praise" is virtue's due. But the word "virtue," so frequent in human morality, is hardly ever used in Scripture. In fact, the only other case of application to man is in <a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5</a>, where it stands between "faith" and "knowledge," and seems specially to signify the energy of practice by which faith grows into knowledge. The reason of this is clear. To the very name of "virtue" clings the idea of self-reliance--such self-reliance as the Stoic philosophy (then the only dominant system of Roman opinion which had any nobleness in it) made its essential characteristic; and that idea is, of course, foreign to the whole conception of Christian morality. The occurrence, therefore, here of an appeal to "virtue" and to "praise" seems strange. We notice, however, that it is introduced by a new phrase of mere hypothesis ("if there be," &c.), which may be taken to mark it as an outlying consideration, occupying a less firm and important ground. Probably, therefore, it is an appeal to the lower conceptions of the society, so characteristically Roman, around them: "Nay, even if there be any truth in the virtue and praise of mere human morality," &c. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true</span>. He repeats the "finally" of <a href="/philippians/2-1.htm">Philippians 2:1</a>, He again and again prepares to close his Epistle, but cannot at once bid farewell to his beloved Philippians. He urges them to fill their thoughts with things good and holy. Christ is the Truth: all that is true comes from him; the false, the vain, is of the earth, earthy. Perhaps the verb (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>) may be emphatic. Sceptics may deny the existence of absolute truth; men may scoffingly ask, "What is truth?" Truth is real, and it is found in Christ, the Truth. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever things are honest</span>. The word (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span>) occurs only here and four times in the pastoral Epistles. It is a word difficult translate. "Honourable" or" reverend" (the renderings of the R.V.) are better equivalents than "honest." It points to a Christian decorum, a Christian self-respect, which is quite consistent with true humility, for it is a reverence for the temple of God. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever things are just</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">righteous</span>, in the widest meaning. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever things are pure</span>; not only chaste, but free from stain or defilement of any sort. The word used here (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> not common in the New Testament. The adverb occurs in <a href="/philippians/1-16.htm">Philippians 1:16</a>, where it is rendered "sincerely," and implies purity of motive. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever things are lovely</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;</span>); not beautiful, but pleasing, lovable; whatsoever things would attract the love of holy souls. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever things are of good report</span>. The word (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) means "well-speaking" (not "well spoken of"), and so "gracious," "attractive;" in classical Greek it means "auspicious," "of good omen." Of these six heads, the first two describe the subjects of devout thought as they are in themselves; the second pair relate to practical life; the third pair to the moral approbation which the contemplation of a holy life excites in good men. <span class="cmt_word">If there be any virtue</span>. This word, so very common in the Greek moralists, occurs nowhere else in St. Paul. Nor does any other of the New Testament writers use it except St. Peter (l Peter 2:9 (in the Greek); <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3, 5</a>). Bishop Lightfoot says, "The strangeness of the word, combined with the change of expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, will suggest another explanation: 'Whatever value may reside in your old heathen conception of virtue, whatever consideration is due to the praise of men; ' as if the apostle were anxious not to omit any possible ground of appeal." <span class="cmt_word">And if there be any praise</span>; comp. <a href="/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/8-21.htm">2 Corinthians 8:21</a>, where St. Paul bids us "provide for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men." Nevertheless, in the highest point of view, the praise of the true Israelite is not of man, but of God. <span class="cmt_word">Think on these things</span>; or, as in the margin of R.V., <span class="accented">take account of.</span> Let these be the considerations which guide your thoughts and direct your motives. The apostle implies that we have the power of governing our thoughts, and so are responsible for them. If the thoughts are ordered well, the outward life will follow. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Finally,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#959;&#953;&#960;&#972;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(loipon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3063.htm">Strong's 3063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Finally, from now on, henceforth, beyond that.
