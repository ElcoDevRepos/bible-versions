This phrase reflects the Christian understanding that sanctification is a lifelong process. Paul, despite his significant contributions to the early church, admits he has not yet reached spiritual perfection. This humility is a model for believers, reminding them that no one is beyond the need for growth and transformation. The "all this" refers to the resurrection and complete transformation into Christ's likeness, as discussed earlier in <a href="/philippians/3.htm">Philippians 3</a>.<p><b>or have already been made perfect</b><br>The concept of perfection here is about spiritual maturity and completeness in Christ. In the Greco-Roman world, perfection often implied a state of completeness or fulfillment of purpose. Paul contrasts this with the Christian journey, which is ongoing. Theologically, this aligns with the doctrine of sanctification, where believers are progressively conformed to the image of Christ. This phrase also counters any notion of spiritual elitism, emphasizing that even apostles are on a journey toward holiness.<p><b>but I press on</b><br>Paul uses athletic imagery, common in his writings, to describe the Christian life as a race or pursuit. The Greek word for "press on" suggests vigorous and determined effort. This reflects the cultural context of the Isthmian Games, similar to the Olympics, which were familiar to his audience. The Christian life requires perseverance and dedication, akin to an athlete striving for victory. This imagery is also found in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>, where Paul speaks of running the race to win the prize.<p><b>to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me</b><br>This phrase highlights the reciprocal nature of the Christian calling. Christ's initiative in "taking hold" of Paul refers to his conversion experience on the road to Damascus (Acts 9). It underscores the idea of divine election and purpose. Believers are called to actively pursue the purpose for which they were saved, which is to become like Christ and fulfill God's will. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and human responsibility working together in the process of salvation and sanctification.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Philippians.

The verse calls every believer to the same humble honesty, relentless pursuit, and grace-grounded confidence until the day we stand complete in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/philippians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Not as though . . .</span>--The tenses are here varied. <span class= "ital">Not as though I ever yet attained, or have been already made perfect.</span> To "attain," or <span class= "ital">receive</span> (probably the prize, see <a href="/philippians/3-14.htm" title="I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.">Philippians 3:14</a>), is a single act; "to be perfected" a continuous process. Clearly St. Paul has no belief, either in any indefectible grasp of salvation, or in any attainment of full spiritual perfection on this side of the grave. We may note our Lord's use of the word "to be perfected" to signify His death (<a href="/luke/13-32.htm" title="And he said to them, Go you, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.">Luke 13:32</a>), and a similar application of the word to Him in <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-9.htm" title="And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him;">Hebrews 5:9</a>; also the use of the words "made perfect" to signify the condition of the glorified (<a href="/hebrews/11-40.htm" title="God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.">Hebrews 11:40</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-23.htm" title="To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,">Hebrews 12:23</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not as though I had already. attained, either were already perfect</span>; the R.V. renders this clause more accurately, <span class="accented">not that</span> (1<span class="accented">. do not say that</span>) <span class="accented">I have already obtained.</span> The verb is not the same with that translated "attain" in ver. 11; it means to get, to win a prize, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>. The tense is aorist: "I say not that I did at once win the prize;" that is, at the time of his conversion. Compare the tenses used in ver. 8, "I suffered the loss of all things;" and ver. 12, "I was apprehended;" which both refer to the same time. The prize was gained in a moment; it needs the continued effort of a lifetime. St. Paul proceeds, using now the perfect tense, "Nor have I been already made perfect." He has not even now reached perfection; he is still working out his own salvation. There may be here a delicate allusion to the spiritual pride which seems to have disturbed the unity of the Philippians (see <a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2-4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But I follow after</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">pursue</span>, <span class="accented">I press</span> on. <span class="cmt_word">If that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus</span>.
