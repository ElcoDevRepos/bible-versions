This familiarity underscores the deep relationship Paul had with this congregation, which was founded during his second missionary journey.<p><b>in the early days of the gospel</b><br>This phrase refers to the initial spread of the Christian message in Europe. The "early days" highlight the pioneering efforts of Paul and his companions in establishing the church in Philippi. It was a time of significant growth and challenges, as the gospel was being introduced to new regions and cultures.<p><b>when I left Macedonia</b><br>Macedonia was a Roman province in northern Greece, and Philippi was one of its leading cities. After founding the church in Philippi, Paul continued his missionary journey, leaving Macedonia to spread the gospel further. This departure is documented in <a href="/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>, where Paul travels to Thessalonica and Berea.<p><b>no church but you partnered with me</b><br>The Philippians were unique in their support of Paul's ministry. Despite the existence of other churches, only the Philippians consistently provided financial and material assistance. This partnership reflects a deep commitment to the mission of spreading the gospel and a strong bond with Paul.<p><b>in the matter of giving and receiving</b><br>This phrase highlights the reciprocal nature of the relationship between Paul and the Philippians. Their giving was not just financial but also spiritual, as they shared in the blessings and challenges of Paul's ministry.

By doing so, he highlights their firsthand awareness of how God used them. Their knowledge isn&#8217;t abstract&#8212;it&#8217;s relational, rooted in lived experience with Paul from the start (compare <a href="/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the early days of the gospel</b><p>These &#8220;early days&#8221; point back to the church&#8217;s infancy recorded in <a href="/acts/16-12.htm">Acts 16:12-40</a>. Lydia&#8217;s conversion, the jailer&#8217;s household, and the swift growth of that small assembly mark the dawn of gospel light in Europe. Paul underscores that their generosity began when resources were scarce and persecution was real (<a href="/acts/17-1.htm">Acts 17:1-9</a>), emphasizing the authenticity of their faith (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when I left Macedonia</b><p>After Philippi, Paul traveled to Thessalonica and Berea, still within Macedonia (<a href="/acts/17-1.htm">Acts 17:1-14</a>). Eventually he moved on to Achaia (<a href="/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1</a>). Each step was bathed in the Philippians&#8217; practical support. Their aid followed him beyond their own region, showing mission-minded vision before he even reached Corinth (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-9.htm">2 Corinthians 11:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>no church but you partnered with me</b><p>&#8220;Partnered&#8221; recalls their koinonia&#8212;deep fellowship (<a href="/philippians/1-7.htm">Philippians 1:7</a>). Other congregations existed, yet none shared financially at that moment. The Philippians stood out like the widow with two mites (<a href="/luke/21-1.htm">Luke 21:1-4</a>).

It is probably to this gift that reference is made; though it is of course possible that some contribution may have reached him at the time of his actual departure in haste after the persecution at Ber?a. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel when I departed from Macedonia</span>.

Chrysostom understands this of giving worldly things and receiving spiritual things (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/9-11.htm">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>). But the context seems to restrict the meaning to temporal gifts: the Philippians gave, St. Paul received.
