This reflects his radical transformation from a Pharisee who valued the law and his heritage (<a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5-6</a>) to a follower of Christ who sees these as insignificant. The Greek word for "loss" (&#950;&#951;&#956;&#943;&#945;) can also mean damage or detriment, indicating that anything apart from Christ is not just less valuable but potentially harmful to spiritual growth.<p><b>compared to the surpassing excellence of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord</b><br>The phrase highlights the supreme value of a personal relationship with Christ. "Knowing" here implies an intimate, experiential knowledge rather than mere intellectual assent. This echoes <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>, where knowing God is presented as the ultimate boast. The use of "my Lord" underscores Paul's personal devotion and submission to Christ's authority, a significant shift from his previous life under the law.<p><b>for whom I have lost all things</b><br>Paul's statement is both literal and metaphorical. He gave up his status, reputation, and possibly material wealth for the sake of Christ. This mirrors the call of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-26</a>, where followers are urged to deny themselves and take up their cross. Historically, early Christians often faced persecution and loss of social standing, making Paul's words resonate deeply with his audience.<p><b>I consider them rubbish</b><br>The term "rubbish" (&#963;&#954;&#973;&#946;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#957;) is a strong word that can mean refuse or dung. Paul uses this vivid language to express the worthlessness of his former gains compared to Christ. This reflects a radical re-evaluation of values, akin to the parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl of great price in <a href="/matthew/13-44.htm">Matthew 13:44-46</a>, where everything is sold to gain something of far greater worth.<p><b>that I may gain Christ</b><br>Paul's ultimate goal is to gain Christ, which involves a deep, abiding relationship and union with Him. This is not about earning salvation but about prioritizing Christ above all else. The concept of "gaining" Christ ties into the idea of being found in Him (<a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>) and reflects the eschatological hope of eternal life with Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a> and <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, Paul is writing from prison, expressing his deep commitment to Christ and the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where Paul established a church.

Paul models a heart that gladly trades temporary gain for eternal treasure, proving that the only true profit in life is to &#8220;gain Christ.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/philippians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">For the excellency of the knowledge.</span>--The word "excellency" is here strictly used to indicate (as in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/3-9.htm" title="For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.">2Corinthians 3:9-11</a>) that the knowledge of Christ so surpasses all other knowledge, and, indeed, all other blessings whatever, as to make them less nothing. As Chrysostom says here, "When the sun hath appeared, it is loss to sit by a candle." The light of the candle in the sunlight actually casts a shadow. How that knowledge is gained we learn in <a href="/context/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17-18</a>, "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith: that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may . . . know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge."<p><span class= "bld">Dung.</span>--The word appears to mean "refuse" of any kind. The sense adopted in our version is common. Dr. Lightfoot, however, quotes instances of its use for the fragments from a feast, and remarks on the old derivation of the word from that which is "thrown to dogs," which, however etymologically questionable, shows the idea attached to the word. This use would suit well enough with the ideas suggested by the retort of the name "dogs" on the Judaisers.<p><span class= "bld">I suffered the loss of all things.</span>--There seems to be here a play on words. These things were (he has said) loss; he suffered the loss of them: and the loss of a loss is a "gain."<p><span class= "bld">That I may win</span> (properly, <span class= "ital">gain</span>) <span class= "bld">Christ, and be found in him.</span>--The line of thought in these two clauses is like that of <a href="/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>, "Now that ye have known God, or rather are known of God." The first idea suggested by the context is that of "gaining Christ," finding Him and laying hold of Him by faith; but this, if taken alone, is unsatisfactory, as resting too much on the action of man. Hence St. Paul adds, and "be found (of God) in Him," drawn into union with Him by the grace of God, so that we may "dwell in Him, and He in us," and be "found" abiding in Him in each day of God's visitation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss</span>. He holds fast the truth which he once learned; he still counts all things as loss in comparison with the one thing needful. The particles used here (see Winer, sect. liii.) correct and strengthen the assertion of the last verse, both as to time, "I count," and as to extent, "all things," not only the privileges mentioned above<span class="cmt_word">. For the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord</span>. The preposition may be rendered "for the sake of," as in ver. 7, or "because of." The knowledge of Christ is a blessing so surpassing and transcendent that nothing else is worthy to be called good in comparison with that one highest good. Its glory, like the rising sun, overwhelms and hides all lesser lights. <span class="accented">My Lord.</span> The pronoun expresses the warmth of his affection, the close personal communion between the apostle and the Savior (see ch. 1:3). <span class="cmt_word">For whom I have suffered the loss of all things</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I suffered the loss of</span>; literally, I was fined or <span class="accented">mulcted</span>; the aorist refers to the time of his conversion. <span class="accented">All things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>); all that I had in the world, my all, all things together (comp. <a href="/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>). He lost his all for Christ, for the sake of possessing Christ: with Christ God will freely give him all things (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> again<span class="cmt_word">). And do count them but dung, that I may win Christ</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> (also in Ecclus. 27:4); dung, or perhaps refuse, dogs' meat; comp. <a href="/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26, 27</a>. There the Jews were the children, the Gentiles dogs. St. Paul here, as in ver. 2, reverses the terms of the comparison; the legal privileges of the Jew nee but as crumbs thrown to dogs in comparison with the rich blessings of the gospel. Comp. also <a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>, where our Lord uses the same verbs, to lose and to gain; the whole world is but loss, the Savior says, compared with the never-dying soul. The loss of one's all in this world (St. Paul echoes the sacred words) is as nothing; all things put together are but as dung, compared with the one thing which St. Paul so longed to gain, Christ himself - his presence in the soul, spiritual union with the Lord. "To gain Christ is to lay fast hold upon him, to receive him inwardly into our bosoms, and so to make him ours and ourselves his, that we may be joined to him as our Head, espoused to him as our Husband, incorporated into him as our Nourishment, engrafted in him as our Stock, and laid upon him as a sure Foundation" (Bishop Hall, ' Christ Mystical,' ch. 6, quoted by Bishop EIlicott). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/3-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">More than that,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
