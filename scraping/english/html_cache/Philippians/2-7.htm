It signifies Christ's voluntary renunciation of His divine privileges and glory, not His divine nature. This self-emptying is a profound act of humility and love, aligning with the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. It reflects the willingness of Jesus to set aside His heavenly status to fulfill God's redemptive plan. This act is a model of selflessness and obedience, emphasizing the importance of humility in the Christian life.<p><b>taking the form of a servant</b><br>Here, "form" translates from the Greek "morphe," indicating the essence or nature. Jesus did not merely appear as a servant; He truly became one. This aligns with the cultural context of servanthood in the ancient world, where servants had no rights or status. Jesus' servanthood is a fulfillment of the messianic prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>, where the Messiah is depicted as God's servant. This act of taking on servanthood is a type of Christ's role as the ultimate servant leader, exemplified in His earthly ministry and sacrificial death.<p><b>being made in human likeness</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the incarnation, where the eternal Son of God took on human flesh. "Likeness" suggests that while Jesus was fully human, He was also without sin, distinguishing Him from fallen humanity. This concept is central to the doctrine of the hypostatic union, where Jesus is both fully God and fully man. The historical context of the Greco-Roman world, with its pantheon of gods, contrasts sharply with the Christian claim of God becoming man. This incarnation fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which speaks of Immanuel, "God with us." Jesus' humanity allowed Him to empathize with human weaknesses and ultimately provide salvation through His death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, who exemplifies humility and servanthood by emptying Himself and taking on human form.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>The city where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.

Of this He stripped Himself in the Incarnation, taking on Him the "form (or, <span class= "ital">nature</span>) of a servant" of God. He resumed it for a moment in the Transfiguration; He was crowned with it anew at the Ascension.<p><span class= "bld">Made in the likeness of man.</span>--This clause, at first sight, seems to weaken the previous clause, for it does not distinctly express our Lord's true humanity. But we note that the phrase is "the likeness of men," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of men in general, men as they actually are. Hence the key to the meaning is to be found in such passages as <a href="/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>, God sent His own Son in "the likeness of sinful flesh;" or <a href="/hebrews/2-17.htm" title="Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.">Hebrews 2:17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a>, "It behoved Him to be made like unto His brethren," "in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin." It would have been an infinite humiliation to have assumed humanity, even in unique and visible glory; but our Lord went beyond this, by deigning to seem like other men in all things, one only of the multitude, and that, too, in a station, which confused Him with the commoner types of mankind. The truth of His humanity is expressed in the phrase "form of a servant;" its unique and ideal character is glanced at when it is said to have worn only the "likeness of men." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But made himself of no reputation</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">but emptied himself</span>; not, he indeed, of the Godhead, which could not be, but of its manifestation, its glory. This he did once for all, as the aorist implies, at the Incarnation. The word "emptied' involves a previous fullness, "a precedent plenitude" (Pearson on the Creed, 2:25). The Divine majesty of which he emptied himself was his own, his own rightful prerogative; and his humiliation was his own voluntary <span class="accented">act - he</span> emptied <span class="accented">himself.</span> "He used his equality with God as an opportunity, not for self-exaltation, but for self-abasement" (Alford). "<span class="accented">Manebat plenus</span>, <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, et tureen perinde se gessit ac si esset" (Bengel). And took upon him the form of a servant; rather, as R.V., taking the form. The two clauses refer to the same act of self-humiliation regarded from its two sides. He emptied himself of his glory, taking at the same time the form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> as in Ver. 6, the essential attributes) of a servant, literally, of a slave. Observe, he was originally (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) in the form of God; he took (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>) the form of a slave. The Godhead was his by right, the manhood by his own voluntary act: both are equally real; he is perfect God and perfect Man. Isaiah prophesied of Christ (<a href="/isaiah/49.htm">Isaiah 49</a> and Isaiah 52; comp. <a href="/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>, in the Greek or R.V.) as the Servant of Jehovah; he came to do the Father's will, submitting his own will in all things: "Not as I will, but as thou wilt" (comp. <a href="/matthew/20-27.htm">Matthew 20:27, 28</a>; <a href="/mark/10-44.htm">Mark 10:44, 45</a><span class="cmt_word">).

This clause is another description of the one act of the Incarnation he <span class="accented">was</span> God, he <span class="accented">became</span> man. Form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>) asserts the reality of our Lord's human nature. Likeness (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) refers only to external appearance: this word, of course, does not imply that our Lord was not truly man, but, as Chrysostom says ('Hom.,' 8:247), he was more. than man; "We are soul and body, but he is God and soul and body." <span class="accented">The likeness of men</span>; because Christ is the Representative of humanity: he took upon him, not a human person, but human nature.
