This reflects his pastoral concern and the need for vigilance against false teachings. The repetition also suggests that the issue was ongoing and required constant attention. Paul&#8217;s frequent warnings are consistent with his role as a shepherd to the early church, ensuring that the believers remain steadfast in their faith.<p><b>and now say again even with tears:</b><br>Paul&#8217;s emotional response underscores the seriousness of the situation. His tears reflect his deep love and concern for the Philippians and the potential spiritual danger they face. This emotional appeal highlights the gravity of turning away from the true gospel. It is reminiscent of other instances where Paul expresses deep sorrow for those who are lost or led astray, such as in <a href="/romans/9-2.htm">Romans 9:2-3</a>.<p><b>Many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.</b><br>This phrase identifies a specific group whose lifestyle and beliefs are contrary to the message of the cross. The "enemies of the cross" likely refers to those who reject the sacrificial nature of Christ&#8217;s death and the call to live a life of self-denial. This could include Judaizers who insisted on adherence to the law for salvation or antinomians who abused grace as a license for sin. The cross symbolizes the core of Christian faith, and to oppose it is to oppose the essence of the gospel. This warning is echoed in other Pauline letters, such as <a href="/galatians/6-12.htm">Galatians 6:12-14</a>, where Paul contrasts boasting in the flesh with boasting in the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, Paul is writing to the church in Philippi with deep concern and emotion, warning them about those who oppose the message of the cross.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where Paul established a church.

The Judaising tenets were, indeed, in a true sense, an enmity to that cross, which was "to the Jews a stumbling-block," because, as St. Paul shows at large in the Galatian and Roman Epistles, they trenched upon faith in the all-sufficient atonement, and so (as he expresses it with startling emphasis) made Christ to "be dead in vain." But the doctrine of the Cross has two parts, distinct, yet inseparable. There is the cross which He alone bore for us, of which it is our comfort to know that we need only believe in it, and cannot share it. There is also the cross which we are "to take up and follow Him" (<a href="/matthew/10-38.htm" title="And he that takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me.">Matthew 10:38</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm" title="Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.">Matthew 16:24</a>), in the "fellowship of His sufferings and conformity to His death," described above (<a href="/context/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Philippians 3:10-11</a>). St. Paul unites both in the striking passage which closes his Galatian Epistle (<a href="/galatians/6-14.htm" title="But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.">Galatians 6:14</a>). He says, "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ!" but he adds, "whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I to the world." Under cover, perhaps, of absolute acceptance of the one form of this great doctrine, the Antinomian party, "continuing in sin that grace might abound," were, in respect of the other, "enemies of the cross of Christ." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ</span>; rather, I <span class="accented">used to tell you</span>; the tense is imperfect. He used to speak thus of them when he was at Philippi; now, during his absence, the evil has increased, and he repeats his warning with tears. "Paul weeps," says Chrysostom, "for those at whom others laugh; so true is his sympathy, so deep his care for all men." He seems to be speaking here, not of the Jews, but of nominal Christians, who used their liberty for a cloke of licentiousness. Such are enemies of the cross; they hate sell-denial, they will not take up their cross. By their evil lives they bring shame upon the religion of the cross. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/3-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
