This echoes the theme of God's provision seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, where the Lord is described as a shepherd who provides all needs. Paul's statement also aligns with the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>, where believers are encouraged not to worry about material needs.<p><b>now that I have received your gifts from Epaphroditus</b><br>Epaphroditus was a member of the Philippian church who delivered their gifts to Paul. This act of service highlights the early Christian practice of supporting missionaries and leaders, as seen in <a href="/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29-30</a>. The Philippians' generosity is a practical demonstration of fellowship and partnership in the gospel (<a href="/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>). Epaphroditus's role underscores the importance of personal sacrifice and commitment in the service of the church.<p><b>They are a fragrant offering</b><br>This phrase draws on Old Testament sacrificial language, particularly from Leviticus, where offerings are described as "a pleasing aroma" to God (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9, 13, 17</a>). It signifies that the Philippians' gifts are not merely material but have spiritual significance, akin to worship. This concept is further developed in <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>, where Christ's sacrifice is described as a fragrant offering, indicating that acts of love and generosity are reflections of Christ's own sacrifice.<p><b>an acceptable sacrifice</b><br>The idea of an acceptable sacrifice is rooted in the Old Testament, where offerings had to meet specific criteria to be pleasing to God (<a href="/leviticus/22-19.htm">Leviticus 22:19-20</a>). In the New Testament, the focus shifts to spiritual sacrifices, such as those mentioned in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to offer their bodies as living sacrifices. The Philippians' gifts are seen as acceptable because they are given with the right heart and intention, aligning with the principle that God values the giver's heart (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<p><b>well-pleasing to God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the Philippians' actions align with God's will and bring Him joy. It reflects the biblical teaching that God delights in obedience and generosity (<a href="/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>). The concept of pleasing God is central to Christian living, as seen in <a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>, where believers are encouraged to live in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to Him. The Philippians' generosity is a tangible expression of their faith and love, which is ultimately pleasing to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Philippians while imprisoned.

Yet not content with this, he adds, "I am full," thoroughly complete in all things. The exuberance of courtesy and gratitude is strongly marked.<p><span class= "bld">An odour of a sweet smell.</span>--See <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm" title="And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling smell.">Ephesians 5:2</a>, and Note there. Here St. Paul adds at once an explanation of the meaning of this metaphorical phrase, in the words, "a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God." Comp. <a href="/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>, "a sacrifice holy, acceptable to God." The word "sacrifice" used in both cases is the one which properly signifies a "bloody sacrifice," and in relation to such sacrifices the idea of propitiation naturally occurs to our minds; since we know that "without shedding of blood is no remission." But it is clear that here it belongs to the class of Eucharistic or free-will offerings; for it is simply an offering made freely, in grateful love to God and man; and exactly in this sense we find, in <a href="/hebrews/13-16.htm" title="But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.">Hebrews 13:16</a> (in close connection with "we have an altar"), "To do good, and to communicate forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased." In the Epistle to the Romans it is, on the other hand, used for that which the burnt offering typified--the absolute self-dedication of the sacrificer, body and soul, to God. (See Note on <a href="/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>.) To <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a>, where all Christians are called "a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God in Jesus Christ," both senses may be fairly applied. It may be noted that most superstitions in the Church as to the spiritual value of either of these forms of sacrifice, have come from confusion between them and the true or propitiatory sacrifice. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I have all, and abound: am full</span>.
