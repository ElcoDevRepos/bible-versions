The term "mind" here refers to a way of thinking or a disposition. In the context of Philippians, Paul is addressing a community that he encourages to live in unity and humility. This exhortation is consistent with the broader biblical theme of transformation through the renewal of the mind, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>. The call to have a Christ-like mindset is foundational to Christian discipleship, emphasizing the importance of internal transformation that leads to external actions.<p><b>which was also in Christ Jesus:</b><br>The mindset that believers are to adopt is exemplified by Christ Himself. This phrase introduces the Christological hymn that follows in <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-11</a>, which describes the humility and exaltation of Jesus. Historically, this passage is significant as it reflects early Christian beliefs about the nature and work of Christ. Theologically, it underscores the incarnation, where Jesus, though fully divine, took on human form and lived a life of obedience and humility. This serves as the ultimate model for believers, highlighting themes of selflessness and servanthood. The reference to Christ's mindset connects to other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>, where Jesus describes Himself as "gentle and humble in heart," and <a href="/john/13-14.htm">John 13:14-15</a>, where He washes the disciples' feet, demonstrating servant leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, writing to encourage and instruct the church in Philippi.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A Roman colony in Macedonia, where Paul established a church during his second missionary journey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ_jesus.htm">Christ Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose mindset and example are the focus of this passage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_mind_of_christ.htm">The Mind of Christ</a></b><br>Emulate Christ's humility, selflessness, and obedience.<br><br>Understand that having the mind of Christ involves a radical transformation of our thoughts and attitudes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_and_service.htm">Humility and Service</a></b><br>Christ's mindset was characterized by humility and a willingness to serve others, even to the point of death.<br><br>We are called to adopt this same attitude in our interactions with others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_body_of_christ.htm">Unity in the Body of Christ</a></b><br>Having the mind of Christ fosters unity among believers, as it leads to putting others' needs above our own.<br><br>This unity is essential for the effective witness of the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_will.htm">Obedience to God's Will</a></b><br>Christ's life was marked by obedience to the Father, even when it led to suffering.<br><br>We are encouraged to follow His example, trusting in God's plan for our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Philippians_2_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Philippians 2:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Adopt_Christ_s_mindset_from_Philippians_2_5.htm">How can we adopt the mindset of Christ as described in Philippians 2:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_Christ_s_attitude_daily.htm">What does "attitude of Christ Jesus" mean in practical daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Phil_2_5_Rom_12_2_Mind_renewal_link.htm">How does Philippians 2:5 relate to Romans 12:2 about renewing the mind?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_mirror_Christ_s_humility_in_bonds.htm">In what ways can we emulate Christ's humility in our relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Philippians_2_5_s_role_in_church_unity.htm">How can Philippians 2:5 guide our interactions within the church community?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Philippians_2_5_Christ_s_mindset_today.htm">How does Philippians 2:5 define the mindset of Christ for believers today?

In this he marks out, first, the Incarnation, in which, "being in the form of God, He took on Him the form of a servant," assuming a sinless but finite humanity; and next, the Passion, which was made needful by the sins of men, and in which His human nature was humiliated to the shame and agony of the cross. Inseparable in themselves, these two great acts of His self-sacrificing love must be distinguished. Ancient speculation delighted to suggest that the first might have been, even if humanity had remained sinless, while the second was added because of the fall and its consequences. Such speculations are, indeed, thoroughly precarious and unsubstantial--for we cannot ask what might have been in a different dispensation from our own; and, moreover, we read of our Lord as "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" (<a href="/revelation/13-8.htm" title="And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.">Revelation 13:8</a>; see also <a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19</a>)--but they at least point to a true distinction. As "the Word of God" manifested in the Incarnation, our Lord is the treasure of all humanity as such; as the Saviour through death, He is the especial treasure of us as sinners. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus</span>; literally, according to the reading of the best manuscripts, <span class="accented">mind this in you which was also</span> (<span class="accented">minded</span>) <span class="accented">in Christ Jesus.</span> Many manuscripts take the words "every man" (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) of Ver. 4 with Ver. 5: "All of you mind this." The words, "in Christ Jesus," show that the corresponding words, "in you," cannot mean "among you," but in yourselves, in your heart. The apostle refers us to the supreme example of unselfishness and humility, the Lord Jesus Christ. He bids us mind (comp. <a href="/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5</a>) the things which the Lord Jesus minded, to love what he loved, to hate what he hated; the thoughts, desires, motives, of the Christian should be the thoughts, desires, motives, which filled the sacred heart of Jesus Christ our Lord. We must strive to imitate him, to reproduce his image, not only in the outward, but even in the inner life. Especially here we are biddcn to follow his unselfishness and humility. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philippians/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Let this mind be</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(phroneite)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5426.htm">Strong's 5426: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I think, (b) I think, judge, (c) I direct the mind to, seek for, (d) I observe, (e) I care for. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
