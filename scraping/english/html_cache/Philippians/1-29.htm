The word "granted" suggests a gift or privilege, indicating that what follows is not merely a duty but a grace bestowed by God. In the context of Philippians, Paul writes to a church he deeply loves, and he often speaks of the joy and privilege of serving Christ. The idea of being granted something "on behalf of Christ" underscores the believer's union with Christ, a central theme in Pauline theology (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>). This union means that believers participate in both the blessings and the sufferings of Christ.<p><b>not only to believe in Him</b><br>Belief in Christ is presented as a gift, not merely a human decision. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching that faith itself is a work of God (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The Philippian church, located in a Roman colony, would have faced pressure to conform to the imperial cult and pagan practices. Believing in Christ set them apart, marking them as citizens of a heavenly kingdom (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>). This belief is not passive but involves trust and allegiance to Jesus as Lord, a radical declaration in a context where Caesar was proclaimed as lord.<p><b>but also to suffer for Him</b><br>Suffering for Christ is portrayed as a continuation of the believer's identification with Him. In the early church, suffering was often seen as a mark of true discipleship (<a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>). The Philippians, like many early Christians, faced persecution and hardship for their faith. Paul himself was writing from prison, exemplifying the reality of suffering for the gospel. This suffering is not without purpose; it serves to advance the gospel and refine the believer's faith (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>). Theologically, it connects to the concept of sharing in Christ's sufferings, which leads to sharing in His glory (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Philippians.

The fearlessness of the Christian is a gift of God, not an inherent stoic self-sufficiency. It rests indeed upon the sense that it is a privilege to suffer (see <a href="/acts/5-41.htm" title="And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.">Acts 5:41</a>) in the cause of truth, yet still more on the belief that such suffering is for no abstract principle, but on behalf of Christ and with Christ. (See <a href="/context/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Philippians 2:17-18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Not only to believe . . .</span>--The original shows that St. Paul speaks as if he originally intended simply to say "it is given on behalf of Christ to suffer."
