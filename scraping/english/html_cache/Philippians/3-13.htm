This reflects the early Christian community's emphasis on unity and mutual support. The phrase "I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it" shows Paul's humility and acknowledgment of his ongoing spiritual journey. Despite his significant contributions to the early Church, Paul admits he has not yet achieved complete spiritual maturity or perfection. This humility is consistent with his teachings in other letters, such as <a href="/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18-25</a>, where he discusses the struggle with sin. The "it" Paul refers to is the ultimate goal of knowing Christ fully and attaining the resurrection from the dead, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10-11</a>.<p><b>But one thing I do:</b><br>Paul emphasizes focus and determination with the phrase "one thing I do." This singular focus is reminiscent of Jesus' teaching in <a href="/luke/10-42.htm">Luke 10:42</a>, where He tells Martha that only one thing is necessary, highlighting the importance of prioritizing spiritual matters. Paul's concentrated effort is a call to believers to prioritize their relationship with Christ above all else, avoiding distractions that can lead them away from their spiritual goals.<p><b>Forgetting what is behind</b><br>"Forgetting what is behind" suggests a deliberate choice to let go of past achievements, failures, and experiences that could hinder spiritual progress. In the context of Philippians, Paul had previously listed his credentials and accomplishments in Judaism (<a href="/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-6</a>), but he now considers them as loss for the sake of Christ (<a href="/philippians/3-7.htm">Philippians 3:7-8</a>). This act of forgetting is not about erasing memories but rather not allowing them to dictate one's present and future actions. It aligns with <a href="/isaiah/43-18.htm">Isaiah 43:18-19</a>, where God encourages His people to forget former things and embrace the new work He is doing.<p><b>and straining toward what is ahead,</b><br>The imagery of "straining" suggests an athlete in a race, exerting maximum effort to reach the finish line. This metaphor is consistent with Paul's use of athletic imagery in other epistles, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>, where he compares the Christian life to a race requiring discipline and perseverance. "What is ahead" refers to the future hope and promises of God, including the resurrection and eternal life with Christ. This forward-looking perspective encourages believers to remain steadfast in their faith, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1-2</a>, where Christians are urged to run with endurance, fixing their eyes on Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Philippians, Paul is writing from prison, encouraging the believers in Philippi to pursue spiritual maturity and joy in Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where Paul established a church.

His words mirror <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>, where he urges believers to &#8220;run in such a way as to take the prize,&#8221; and <a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>, where he admits he still sees &#8220;in a mirror dimly.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s humility illustrates that salvation&#8217;s past reality (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>) leads to an ongoing process of growth (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12-13</a>). The finish line will be crossed only when Christ &#8220;transforms our lowly bodies&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>). Until then, we stay teachable, alert to the Spirit&#8217;s refining work (<a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But one thing I do</b><p>Paul narrows life&#8217;s clutter to a single, ruling pursuit&#8212;similar to Mary choosing &#8220;the one thing&#8221; that mattered in <a href="/luke/10-42.htm">Luke 10:42</a> and David longing for &#8220;one thing&#8221; in <a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>. Multi-tasking discipleship soon fragments focus; single-minded devotion simplifies it.

(See <a href="/philippians/3-15.htm" title="Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.">Philippians 3:15</a>.) Not only does St. Paul refuse to count that he has ever yet "attained;" he will not allow that he is yet in a position even to grasp at the prize. (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/9-27.htm" title="But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.">1Corinthians 9:27</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Forgetting those things which are behind . . .</span>--The precept is absolutely general, applying to past blessings, past achievements, even past sins. The ineradicable instinct of hope, which the wisdom of the world (not unreasonably if this life be all) holds to be a delusion, or at best a condescension to weakness, is sanctioned in the gospel as an anticipation of immortality. Accordingly hope is made a rational principle, and is always declared to be, not only a privilege, but a high Christian duty, co-ordinate with faith and love (as in <a href="/1_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="And now stays faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.">1Corinthians 13:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm" title="There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;">Ephesians 4:4</a>). St. Paul does not scruple to say that, if we have it not, for the next life as well as this, we Christians are "of all men most miserable" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-19.htm" title="If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.">1Corinthians 15:19</a>). Hence past blessing is but an earnest of the future; past achievements of good are stepping-stones to greater things; past sins are viewed in that true repentance which differs from remorse--"the sorrow of this world which worketh death" (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world works death.">2Corinthians 7:10</a>)--in having a sure and certain hope of the final conquest of all sin. The "eternal life" in Christ is a present gift, but one test of its reality in the present is its possession of the promise of the future. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">I reckon.</span> Two of the best manuscripts read "not yet" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span>).

St. Paul concentrates all his thoughts and all his energies on the one great end of life, the one thing needful.
