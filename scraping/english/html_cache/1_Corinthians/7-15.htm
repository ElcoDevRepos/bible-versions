The phrase "if the unbeliever leaves" acknowledges the reality of mixed-faith marriages in the early church, a situation that arose as individuals converted to Christianity while their spouses did not. The instruction to "let him go" reflects a recognition of the unbeliever's autonomy and the believer's freedom from the obligation to maintain the marriage at all costs. This aligns with the broader biblical principle of peace and freedom in Christ, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>, where believers are called to stand firm in their freedom.<p><b>The believing brother or sister is not bound in such cases.</b><br>This phrase indicates that the believer is not under the bondage of the marital covenant if the unbelieving spouse chooses to depart. The term "not bound" suggests a release from the marital obligations, which is consistent with the Jewish understanding of marriage as a covenant that can be dissolved under certain conditions. This reflects the cultural and legal practices of the time, where marriage was both a personal and social contract. Theologically, this release underscores the priority of one's relationship with God over human relationships, echoing Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a> about the primacy of allegiance to Him.<p><b>God has called you to live in peace.</b><br>The call to "live in peace" serves as a guiding principle for the believer's conduct in all relationships, including marriage. This reflects the biblical theme of peace as a hallmark of the Christian life, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>, where believers are urged to live peaceably with all. The peace mentioned here is not merely the absence of conflict but a holistic sense of well-being and harmony that comes from God. This peace is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) and is central to the believer's witness in a world often marked by division and strife. The call to peace also aligns with the prophetic vision of the Messianic kingdom, where peace reigns supreme (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing issues within the Corinthian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled early Christian community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believing_spouse.htm">Believing Spouse</a></b><br>A Christian married to a non-believer, facing challenges in their marriage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/unbelieving_spouse.htm">Unbelieving Spouse</a></b><br>A non-Christian partner who may choose to leave the marriage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_call_to_peace.htm">God's Call to Peace</a></b><br>The divine principle guiding the believer's response to marital discord.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_marital_boundaries.htm">Understanding Marital Boundaries</a></b><br>The verse acknowledges the reality of mixed-faith marriages and the potential for conflict.

Paul&#8217;s earlier counsel urged staying together if the unbeliever is willing (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm">1 Corinthians 7:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; The release is pastoral: it spares the believer from perpetual uncertainty and grants liberty to pursue God&#8217;s purposes without bondage to a broken covenant (<a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God has called you to live in peace</b><p>&#8226; Peace (shalom) is God&#8217;s design for every believer&#8217;s life and relationships (<a href="/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Forcing an unbelieving spouse to stay could ignite greater strife, contradicting God&#8217;s peace-filled calling (<a href="/proverbs/17-14.htm">Proverbs 17:14</a>).<p>&#8226; When separation occurs, the believer can still walk in peace&#8212;peace with God (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>), peace with self (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>), and as far as possible, peace with others (<a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>).<p>&#8226; This peace is more than the absence of conflict; it is the presence of God&#8217;s wholeness and order, even in painful circumstances (<a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15</a> affirms that if an unbelieving spouse insists on leaving, the believer must release them without harassment.

The verse safeguards the believer, respects the unbeliever&#8217;s choice, and upholds God&#8217;s desire that His children live in the peace He provides.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">But if the unbelieving depart.</span>--Supposing, however, the desire for separation arises from the unbelieving partner, how is the Christian partner to act? If the married life, for example, be made intolerable by the unbeliever urging the believer to join in such religious acts as conscience cannot approve, the Apostle's previous commands for continued union do not hold good: a brother or a sister, in such cases, is not bound to insist upon the continuation of the union. "Let the unbeliever, if he so desire, depart."<p>This permission is in no way contrary to our Lord's permission of divorce on only one ground, for the Apostle has carefully reminded his readers that our Lord's command does not apply to the case of a marriage between a believer and a heathen. In ouch cases we have no command from Him.<p><span class= "bld">A brother or a sister.</span>--That is, a Christian. In such cases, when the unbelieving partner wishes to depart, let him or her do so. The Christian partner is not, under such circumstances, bound by the marriage to continue together.

Milton, in his 'Tetrachordon,' quotes Maimonides to the effect that "divorce was permitted by Moses to preserve peace in marriage and quiet in the family." Similarly, a voluntary separation might be the only possible means of preserving moral peace where the union was between souls separated from each other by so vast a gulf as those of a pagan and a Christian. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
