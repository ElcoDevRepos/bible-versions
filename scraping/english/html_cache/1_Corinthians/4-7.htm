In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul addresses divisions and arrogance within the church. The rhetorical question implies that any perceived superiority is not self-derived but granted by God. This echoes the biblical theme that God is the source of all authority and gifts (<a href="/romans/12-3.htm">Romans 12:3</a>). Historically, Corinth was a wealthy and influential city, which may have contributed to the believers' sense of superiority. The question serves to remind them of their dependence on God, aligning with the biblical principle that all human boasting is futile without acknowledging God's sovereignty (<a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>).<p><b>What do you have that you did not receive?</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the concept of grace and the unmerited nature of God's gifts. In the broader biblical narrative, everything believers possess&#8212;spiritual gifts, salvation, and even life itself&#8212;is received from God (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). The historical context of Corinth, a city known for its commerce and wealth, may have led the church members to forget the source of their blessings. This question serves as a humbling reminder that all talents and resources are entrusted by God, aligning with the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where servants are stewards of what they have been given.<p><b>And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?</b><br>This phrase addresses the issue of boasting and pride. Paul points out the inconsistency in boasting about gifts that are received rather than earned. This aligns with the biblical teaching that boasting should be in the Lord alone (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>). The cultural context of Corinth, with its emphasis on status and achievement, may have influenced the church's behavior. This rhetorical question serves to correct their attitude, reminding them of the humility exemplified by Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>). It underscores the biblical principle that all glory belongs to God, as seen in the doxology of <a href="/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with a focus on humility and the recognition of God's grace in their lives.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and diversity, but also for its moral and spiritual challenges.

In the church, positions of influence&#8212;whether teaching, leading, or serving&#8212;are granted by the Lord, not self-earned (<a href="/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Pride forgets that each believer is part of one body where &#8220;the eye cannot say to the hand, &#8216;I do not need you&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-21.htm">1 Corinthians 12:21</a>).<p>&#8226; True greatness is gauged by faithfulness, not status (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p>When we remember that Christ is the head (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>), any notion of personal supremacy fades.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What do you have that you did not receive?</b><p>The next question tightens the argument: every good thing is a gift. &#8220;Every good and perfect gift is from above&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>Consider what the Corinthians&#8212;and we&#8212;have received:<p>&#8226; Salvation: &#8220;By grace you have been saved through faith&#8230; it is the gift of God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual gifts: &#8220;To each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Daily provision: &#8220;He Himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Ministry opportunities: &#8220;A man can receive only what is given him from heaven&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-27.htm">John 3:27</a>).<p>The list leaves no room for self-congratulation; everything traces back to the open hand of our generous Father (<a href="/psalms/145-16.htm">Psalm 145:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?</b><p>Boasting pretends we are self-made.
