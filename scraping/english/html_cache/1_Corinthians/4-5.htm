In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul addresses divisions within the church and the premature judgments being made by its members. The "appointed time" refers to God's ultimate judgment, which aligns with the eschatological theme found throughout the New Testament, such as in <a href="/matthew/7.htm">Matthew 7:1-2</a>, where Jesus warns against judging others. This reflects the understanding that human judgment is limited and often flawed, while God's judgment is perfect and all-knowing.<p><b>wait until the Lord comes.</b><br>The return of the Lord, or the Second Coming of Christ, is a central tenet of Christian eschatology. This phrase encourages believers to be patient and trust in God's timing. The anticipation of Christ's return is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>. The early church lived with the expectation of Christ's imminent return, which served as a motivation for holy living and perseverance in faith.<p><b>He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness</b><br>This phrase speaks to God's omniscience and the eventual revelation of all things. The imagery of light and darkness is common in Scripture, symbolizing truth and falsehood, or good and evil. In <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, the light of Christ shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. This assurance that God will reveal hidden truths provides comfort to believers who face injustice or misunderstanding, knowing that God's justice will ultimately prevail.<p><b>and will expose the motives of men&#8217;s hearts.</b><br>God's ability to discern the true intentions of the heart is a theme found throughout the Bible. In <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, God tells Samuel that He looks at the heart, not outward appearances. This phrase underscores the idea that human judgment is often superficial, while God's judgment penetrates to the core of one's being. It serves as a reminder for believers to examine their own hearts and motives, aligning them with God's will.<p><b>At that time each will receive his praise from God.</b><br>This final phrase offers hope and encouragement, promising that God will reward those who are faithful. The concept of divine reward is echoed in passages like <a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>, where the faithful servant is commended by the master. This assurance of praise from God serves as motivation for believers to live righteously and remain steadfast in their faith, knowing that their efforts are not in vain and will be recognized by God in His perfect timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, providing guidance on spiritual maturity and judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and moral challenges, where the early church faced issues of division and immorality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Jesus Christ)</a></b><br>The one who will come again to judge the living and the dead, bringing to light the hidden things and revealing the true motives of the heart.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/avoid_premature_judgment.htm">Avoid Premature Judgment</a></b><br>We are cautioned against making judgments before the appointed time.

The word used for "until" (<span class="accented">heos an</span>) points to a time entirely indefinite. <span class="cmt_word">Both</span>; rather, <span class="accented">also</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> among other things. <span class="cmt_word">The hidden things of darkness.</span> "All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>; comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>).

But St. Paul says "praise" for two reasons - partly because he is thinking of faithful teachers like Cephas, Apollos, and himself, who were depreciated by rival factions; and partly because he, like other apostles, shows an invariable tendency to allude to the bright rather than to the dark side of judgment. The "praise from God" - the "Well done, good and faithful servant" - is so infinitely precious that it reduces to insignificance the comparative value of human praise or blame. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8045;&#963;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#333;ste)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5620.htm">Strong's 5620: </a> </span><span class="str2">So that, therefore, so then, so as to.
