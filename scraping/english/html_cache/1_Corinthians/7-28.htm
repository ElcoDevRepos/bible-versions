Here, he reassures believers that choosing to marry is not sinful. This aligns with the biblical view that marriage is a God-ordained institution (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). Paul acknowledges the legitimacy and sanctity of marriage, countering any ascetic beliefs that might suggest celibacy is the only holy path. This reflects the cultural context of Corinth, where diverse views on marriage existed, influenced by both Jewish and Greco-Roman traditions.<p><b>And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned.</b><br>Paul extends his assurance to virgins, emphasizing that entering into marriage is not a sin. In the first-century context, a "virgin" typically referred to an unmarried woman. This statement supports the idea that marriage is honorable for all, as echoed in <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>. It also addresses potential concerns among early Christians who might have felt pressured to remain single due to the imminent return of Christ or societal pressures.<p><b>But those who marry will face troubles in this life,</b><br>Paul candidly acknowledges the practical challenges of marriage. The "troubles" refer to the everyday difficulties and responsibilities that come with married life, such as financial pressures, relational conflicts, and family obligations. This realistic perspective is consistent with the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as Proverbs, which often discusses the complexities of human relationships. Paul's statement serves as a reminder that while marriage is a blessing, it also requires commitment and sacrifice.<p><b>and I want to spare you this.</b><br>Paul's pastoral concern is evident as he expresses a desire to spare believers from additional burdens. His advice is not a prohibition against marriage but a consideration of the present circumstances, possibly including persecution or the "present distress" mentioned earlier in the chapter (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>). This reflects Paul's broader eschatological perspective, where he encourages believers to live with an eternal focus, as seen in his other writings like <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>. His guidance is rooted in a desire for believers to serve the Lord without distraction, whether married or single.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on marriage and singleness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and moral challenges, where the early Christian church faced various issues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, dealing with questions about marriage, celibacy, and Christian living.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/married_couples.htm">Married Couples</a></b><br>Those who have entered into the covenant of marriage, facing unique challenges and responsibilities.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/virgins.htm">Virgins</a></b><br>In this context, referring to unmarried individuals, particularly those who have not engaged in sexual relations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/marriage_is_honorable_but_challenging.htm">Marriage is Honorable but Challenging</a></b><br>Paul affirms that marriage is not sinful, yet he acknowledges the inherent challenges it brings.

Paul encourages freedom: accept marriage joyfully if God leads, remain single confidently if He enables. In every case, believers honor the Lord by trusting His Word, embracing His design, and walking faithfully in the calling they have received (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-24.htm">1 Corinthians 7:24</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">But and if thou marry.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">If, however, thou hast married.</span> The teaching here is not for some who will, after this advice, persist in marrying, but the reference is still to those who are actually married, and a further and clearer statement to them that the question is not one of sin, but merely of desirability.<p><span class= "bld">If a virgin marry.</span>--In the original it is emphatically "If <span class= "ital">the</span> virgin have married." It is possible that in the letter from Corinth some particular case was referred to in which a Christian parent had scruples as to allowing his daughter to marry, and while dealing, in reply, with the subject generally, the Apostle refers immediately here to the particular case which had given rise to the inquiry. He says that if she have married she will have committed no sin; but that she and those who, like her, have married, will have troubles in the flesh, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> earthly troubles. It is not a spiritual question.<p><span class= "bld">But I spare you.</span>--This might, at first sight, seem to imply that he does not desire to harass them by any detail of their troubles just referred to; but the true meaning, however, is that the Apostle states his desire in giving this advice is to spare them their troubles.

Common experience shows that in days of "trouble and rebuke and blasphemy" the cares and anxieties of those who have to bear the burden of many besides themselves, and those dearer to them than their own selves, are far the most trying. Perhaps St. Paul was thinking of the "Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days," of our Lord (<a href="/luke/21-23.htm">Luke 21:23</a>). But I spare you. I desire to spare you from adding to the inevitable distress which will fall upon you in "the great tribulation" - "the travail throes of the Messiah," which we all expect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/7-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#8048;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ean)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1437.htm">Strong's 1437: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
