In the Greco-Roman world, crucifixion was a shameful and brutal form of execution reserved for the worst criminals. The idea that salvation could come through such a means was countercultural and offensive to many. This message is central to Christian doctrine, emphasizing that through Christ's sacrifice, humanity can be reconciled to God. The cross symbolizes both the suffering and the victory of Jesus, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant.<p><b>is foolishness to those who are perishing</b><br>To the unbelieving world, the concept of salvation through a crucified Messiah seemed absurd and irrational. The Greek word for "foolishness" is "moria," from which the English word "moron" is derived, indicating something perceived as nonsensical. Those "who are perishing" refers to individuals who reject the gospel and are on a path to spiritual destruction. This dichotomy between the wisdom of the world and the wisdom of God is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, highlighting the spiritual blindness of those who rely solely on human wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p><b>but to us who are being saved</b><br>The phrase "being saved" indicates an ongoing process of salvation. In Christian theology, salvation is often understood in three tenses: past (justification), present (sanctification), and future (glorification). Believers are justified by faith, are being sanctified through the work of the Holy Spirit, and will be glorified in eternity. This process underscores the transformative power of the gospel in the lives of believers, as they are continually conformed to the image of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>).<p><b>it is the power of God</b><br>The "power of God" refers to the divine ability to bring about salvation through the cross. This power is not just a concept but is actively at work in the lives of believers, enabling them to overcome sin and live in righteousness. The cross, which appears as weakness to the world, is the ultimate demonstration of God's power and wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>). This power is also evident in the resurrection of Jesus, which is the cornerstone of Christian faith and the assurance of eternal life for believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, a city known for its diversity and moral challenges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A Christian community in a cosmopolitan city, struggling with divisions and the influence of secular philosophies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>Central to Christian faith, representing the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the means of salvation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_are_perishing.htm">Those Who Are Perishing</a></b><br>Refers to individuals who reject the gospel and are on a path to spiritual destruction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_are_being_saved.htm">Those Who Are Being Saved</a></b><br>Believers who accept the gospel and experience the transformative power of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_paradox_of_the_cross.htm">The Paradox of the Cross</a></b><br>The cross is a symbol of shame and defeat to the world but represents victory and salvation to believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god.htm">The Power of God</a></b><br>The message of the cross is not just a historical event but an ongoing source of divine power for transformation and salvation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worldly_wisdom_vs._divine_wisdom.htm">Worldly Wisdom vs. Divine Wisdom</a></b><br>Human wisdom often fails to comprehend God's ways, which are revealed through the seemingly foolish message of the cross.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Believers find their identity and purpose in the power of the cross, which shapes their worldview and actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/evangelism_and_witness.htm">Evangelism and Witness</a></b><br>Understanding the cross as the power of God encourages believers to share the gospel boldly, despite it being perceived as foolishness by some.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_1_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 1:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/What_is_the_cross_s_message_to_believers.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 1:18 define the message of the cross for believers?

The cross is either dismissed as nonsense by those in spiritual decay or embraced as God&#8217;s life-giving power by those being saved. The difference is not in the message but in the heart that hears it. To see the cross as God&#8217;s power is to step from perishing into salvation; to regard it as foolishness is to remain under judgment.

It shows the heroic character of the faith of St. Paul that he deliberately preached the doctrine of the cross because he felt that therein lay the conversion and salvation of the world, although he was well aware that he could preach no truth so certain at first to revolt the unregenerate hearts of his hearers. To the Jews "the cross" was the tree of shame and horror; and a crucified person was "accursed of God" (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). To the Greeks the cross was the gibbet of a slave's infamy and a murderer's punishment. There was not a single association connected with it except those of shame and agony. The thought of "a crucified Messiah" seemed to the Jews a revolting folly; the worship of a crucified malefactor seemed to the Greeks "an execrable superstition" (Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 15:44; Pliny, 'Epp.' 10:97); yet so little did St. Paul seek for popularity or immediate success, that this was the very doctrine which he put in the forefront, even at a city so refined and so voluptuous as Corinth. And the result proved his inspired wisdom. That very cross became the recognized badge of Christianity, and when three centuries had elapsed it was woven in gold upon the banners and set in jewels on the diadems of the Roman empire. For had not Christ prophesied, And I, <span class="accented">if I be lifted up</span>, will draw all men unto me"? <span class="cmt_word">Unto us which are being saved;</span> who are on the way of salvation. The same present participle is used in <a href="/luke/13-23.htm">Luke 13:23</a>; <a href="/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>. It is the power of God. Because the cross is at the heart of that gospel which is "the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth" (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>), though many were tempted to be ashamed of it. It could never be a carnal weapon of warfare, and yet was mighty for every purpose (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4, 5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
