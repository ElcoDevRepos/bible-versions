The Apostle Paul is addressing the believers in Corinth, a city known for its diversity and cultural complexity. The church was experiencing issues with spiritual gifts, particularly the misuse of speaking in tongues. Paul uses this phrase to draw a parallel between the need for clear communication in the church and the broader principle of edification.<p><b>Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue,</b><br>Paul stresses the necessity of using language that can be understood by others. In the context of the Corinthian church, speaking in tongues had become a point of pride and division. The Greek word for "intelligible" implies clarity and understanding, which is essential for teaching and edification. This aligns with the broader biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a>, which highlights the value of wise and clear speech.<p><b>how will anyone know what you are saying?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the futility of speaking in a manner that others cannot comprehend. The purpose of spiritual gifts, including speaking in tongues, is to build up the church. Without understanding, the message is lost, and the gift becomes ineffective. This reflects the teaching in <a href="/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a>, which encourages believers to pursue what leads to peace and mutual edification.<p><b>You will just be speaking into the air.</b><br>Paul uses this metaphor to illustrate the pointlessness of unintelligible speech. The phrase "speaking into the air" suggests that words without understanding are as ineffective as sound waves dissipating into the atmosphere. This imagery is consistent with the biblical theme of the power and purpose of words, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word is described as accomplishing what He desires. In contrast, words without meaning fail to achieve their intended purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.
