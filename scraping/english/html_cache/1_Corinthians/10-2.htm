Baptism signifies identification and union. In this context, it represents the Israelites' identification with Moses as their leader and deliverer. This prefigures Christian baptism, which signifies identification with Christ. The concept of baptism as a form of initiation or passage is consistent with Jewish purification rituals and the New Testament understanding of baptism as a symbol of spiritual cleansing and commitment.<p><b>into Moses</b><br>Moses is a type of Christ, serving as a mediator between God and His people. The Israelites' baptism "into Moses" signifies their acceptance of his leadership and the covenant relationship established through him. This parallels the Christian's baptism into Christ, signifying a new covenant relationship. Moses' role as a deliverer and lawgiver foreshadows Christ's role as the ultimate Deliverer and the fulfillment of the Law.<p><b>in the cloud</b><br>The cloud represents God's presence and guidance. During the Exodus, the cloud led the Israelites by day, symbolizing divine protection and direction. This is reminiscent of the Holy Spirit's role in guiding and protecting believers. The cloud also signifies God's glory and holiness, as seen in other biblical instances where God's presence is manifested in a cloud, such as the Transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>).<p><b>and in the sea</b><br>The crossing of the Red Sea is a pivotal event in Israel's history, symbolizing deliverance from slavery and the beginning of a new life. This event is a type of salvation, prefiguring the believer's deliverance from sin through Christ. The sea, a symbol of chaos and danger, becomes a pathway to freedom, illustrating God's power to transform obstacles into opportunities for salvation. This event is echoed in the New Testament as a symbol of baptism, representing the believer's passage from death to life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.
