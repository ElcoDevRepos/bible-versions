Slaves had limited rights and were considered the property of their masters. When Paul writes to the Corinthians, he acknowledges the social reality of slavery but emphasizes a spiritual transformation. Being "called by the Lord" refers to the moment of conversion and acceptance of the Christian faith. This calling transcends earthly status, indicating that one's spiritual identity in Christ is paramount. The concept of being called by God is echoed in passages like <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>, where those whom God predestines, He also calls.<p><b>is the Lord&#8217;s freedman.</b><br>This phrase highlights the paradox of Christian freedom. While a person may be a slave in societal terms, in Christ, they are free. This freedom is not about social liberation but spiritual emancipation from sin and death, as seen in <a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>, "So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed." The term "freedman" would resonate with the audience, as freedmen in Roman society were former slaves who had been granted freedom and certain rights. Spiritually, this signifies liberation from the bondage of sin and the law, as discussed in <a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>.<p><b>Conversely, he who was a free man when he was called</b><br>Paul addresses those who were not slaves at the time of their calling. In the Roman context, free men had more privileges and autonomy. However, Paul reminds them that their earthly freedom does not exempt them from spiritual servitude. This serves as a leveling message, indicating that all believers, regardless of social status, are equal before God. The idea of being called is consistent with the notion of divine election and purpose, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>, where believers are called to hope and inheritance.<p><b>is Christ&#8217;s slave.</b><br>This phrase underscores the concept of willing servitude to Christ, a theme prevalent in Paul's writings. The term "slave" (doulos in Greek) implies total devotion and submission to the will of Christ. This is a voluntary and joyful servitude, contrasting with the involuntary nature of earthly slavery. In <a href="/romans/6-22.htm">Romans 6:22</a>, Paul explains that being a slave to God leads to holiness and eternal life. The imagery of being Christ's slave reflects the believer's commitment to live according to His teachings and commands, as seen in <a href="/philippians/1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>, where Paul refers to himself as a servant of Christ Jesus. This servitude is a type of Christ's own servanthood, as He came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul was writing to the church in Corinth to address various issues and questions they had about Christian living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and cosmopolitan congregation in the city of Corinth, which was known for its wealth and moral challenges.

Though they remained under human masters, their ultimate identity changed the moment they trusted Christ.<p>&#8226; In Christ they possess a freedom no chains can touch&#8212;freedom from sin&#8217;s penalty and power. &#8220;So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<p>&#8226; That liberty includes:<p>&#8211; The right to call God &#8220;Abba, Father&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>).<p>&#8211; Bold access to God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p>&#8211; Assurance of eternal inheritance (<a href="/galatians/4-7.htm">Galatians 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Earthly status becomes secondary.
