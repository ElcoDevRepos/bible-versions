In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/16.htm">1 Corinthians 16</a>, Paul is referring to the household of Stephanas, who were among the first converts in Achaia and had devoted themselves to serving the saints. Submission here implies a willing acknowledgment of their leadership and dedication. Biblically, submission is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>, which instructs believers to obey their leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over their souls. This submission is not about blind obedience but about mutual respect and cooperation in the work of the Gospel. Historically, the early church was structured with leaders who were often chosen based on their spiritual maturity and service, reflecting the need for order and guidance in the growing Christian communities.<p><b>and to every fellow worker and laborer</b><br>This part of the verse broadens the scope of respect and cooperation to include all who are actively involved in the ministry. The terms "fellow worker" and "laborer" highlight the collaborative nature of the early church's mission. Paul often used these terms to describe his co-laborers in the Gospel, such as Timothy, Titus, and others who traveled with him or led local congregations. This reflects the communal aspect of the church, where each member has a role to play, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>, which discusses the body of Christ and the diversity of gifts. The call to honor and support fellow workers aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized servanthood and teamwork among His disciples. Culturally, this would have been a countercultural message in a society that often valued status and hierarchy, underscoring the radical nature of Christian community and service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with instructions and encouragement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled early Christian community in the city of Corinth, known for its challenges with unity and moral issues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephanas_and_his_household.htm">Stephanas and His Household</a></b><br>Mentioned in the preceding verse (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-15.htm">1 Corinthians 16:15</a>), they were the first converts in Achaia and devoted themselves to serving the saints.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fellow_workers_and_laborers.htm">Fellow Workers and Laborers</a></b><br>Refers to those who are actively involved in the ministry and work of the church, supporting its mission and growth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/achaia.htm">Achaia</a></b><br>A region in Greece where Corinth is located, significant in the spread of early Christianity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_submission_in_the_church.htm">The Importance of Submission in the Church</a></b><br>Submission to church leaders and fellow workers is crucial for maintaining order and unity within the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_and_honoring_service.htm">Recognizing and Honoring Service</a></b><br>Acknowledge and appreciate the dedication of those who serve in various capacities within the church, as their work is vital to the community's spiritual health.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_humility_in_christian_life.htm">The Role of Humility in Christian Life</a></b><br>Embrace humility by willingly submitting to those who lead and serve, recognizing that all are working towards the common goal of glorifying God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_for_active_participation.htm">Encouragement for Active Participation</a></b><br>Encourage every believer to find their role in the church, whether as a leader or a supporter, contributing to the mission of spreading the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/building_a_supportive_community.htm">Building a Supportive Community</a></b><br>Foster a church environment where mutual respect and support are prioritized, ensuring that all members feel valued and empowered to serve.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_16_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 16:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_do_we_support_them_in_church_today.htm">How can we "submit to such as these" in our church community today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Qualities_for_submission_in_1_Cor_16_16.htm">What qualities make someone worthy of submission according to 1 Corinthians 16:16?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Hebrews_13_17_1_Cor_Submission_link.htm">How does Hebrews 13:17 relate to the call for submission in 1 Corinthians?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_value_and_support_your_workers.htm">Why is it important to recognize and support those who "labor among you"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Inspire_others_to_serve_devotedly.htm">How can we encourage others to follow the example of devoted service?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_submit_to_such_as_these.htm">What does 1 Corinthians 16:16 mean by "submit to such as these"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_16_16_s_link_to_church_authority.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 16:16 relate to church leadership and authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_submission_in_1_Cor_16_16.htm">Why is submission emphasized in 1 Corinthians 16:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_corinthians_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Corinthians 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_baptism_essential_for_salvation.htm">Is baptism necessary for salvation?
