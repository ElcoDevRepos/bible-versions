The term "sanctified" here does not imply salvation but rather a setting apart for a special purpose. In a mixed-faith marriage, the believing spouse brings a sanctifying influence to the household. This reflects the Old Testament principle where the presence of the righteous can bring blessings to others, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18-26.htm">Genesis 18:26-32</a> with Abraham's intercession for Sodom. The believing spouse's faith and conduct can serve as a witness to the unbelieving partner, potentially leading them to faith in Christ.<p><b>and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband</b><br>This phrase mirrors the previous one, emphasizing the mutual influence spouses have on each other. In the Greco-Roman world, the husband's faith often dictated the family's religious practices. However, Paul acknowledges the spiritual agency of both spouses, regardless of gender. This egalitarian view was countercultural at the time, highlighting the transformative power of the Gospel in breaking down societal norms. The sanctification here is relational and communal, not individual salvation, aligning with the broader biblical theme of God's people being a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p><b>Otherwise your children would be unclean</b><br>In Jewish tradition, "unclean" often referred to ceremonial impurity, which could hinder one's participation in religious life. Paul reassures the Corinthian believers that their children are not spiritually disadvantaged by having one unbelieving parent. This reflects the covenantal understanding seen in the Old Testament, where the faith of the parents impacts the spiritual status of the children, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>. The presence of a believing parent ensures that the children are raised in an environment where they can learn about God and His ways.<p><b>but now they are holy</b><br>The term "holy" signifies being set apart for God. In this context, it means that the children of a mixed-faith marriage are included in the covenant community and are under the spiritual care and influence of the believing parent. This echoes the promise of <a href="/acts/2-39.htm">Acts 2:39</a>, where the promise of salvation is extended to believers and their children. The holiness here is not inherent but relational, indicating that the children are part of the Christian community and have access to its spiritual blessings and teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on marriage and family life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and moral challenges, where the early church faced issues of integrating Christian faith with daily life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believing_spouse.htm">Believing Spouse</a></b><br>A Christian husband or wife whose faith impacts their family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/unbelieving_spouse.htm">Unbelieving Spouse</a></b><br>A non-Christian partner in a marriage, who is influenced by the believing spouse's faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_mixed-faith_marriages.htm">Children of Mixed-Faith Marriages</a></b><br>Offspring of a marriage where one parent is a believer and the other is not, considered "holy" due to the believing parent's influence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sanctification_through_influence.htm">Sanctification Through Influence</a></b><br>The presence of a believing spouse brings a sanctifying influence to the entire household, setting it apart for God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_of_children.htm">Holiness of Children</a></b><br>Children in mixed-faith marriages are considered holy, meaning they are set apart and have a special place in God's plan due to the faith of one parent.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith's_transformative_power.htm">Faith's Transformative Power</a></b><br>The faith of one family member can have a profound impact on the spiritual environment of the home, potentially leading others to Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/marriage_as_a_mission_field.htm">Marriage as a Mission Field</a></b><br>Believers in mixed-faith marriages are called to live out their faith authentically, serving as a witness to their spouse and children.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_family_dynamics.htm">God's Sovereignty in Family Dynamics</a></b><br>Trust in God's ability to work through complex family situations, using the faith of one to bless and influence the whole.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_7_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 7:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_7_14_on_mixed-faith_marriage_sanctity.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 7:14 affirm the sanctity of a mixed-faith marriage?

In contrast to that other union in which the connection is defiling (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="What? know you not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, said he, shall be one flesh.">1Corinthians 6:16</a>), the purity of the believing partner in this union, being a lawful one, as it were, entirely overweighs the impurity of the unbeliever, it being not a moral, but a kind of ceremonial impurity. The children of such marriages were considered to be Christian children; and the fruit being holy, so must we regard as holy the tree from which it springs. It must be remembered that the "sanctification" and "holiness" here spoken of is not that inward sanctification which springs from the action of the Holy Spirit in the individual heart, but that consecration which arises from being in the body of Christ, which is the Christian Church (<a href="/romans/9-16.htm" title="So then it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy.">Romans 9:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is sanctified;</span> literally, <span class="accented">has been sanctified</span>, the status has been rendered (so to speak) theoretically clean. <span class="cmt_word">By the wife;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the wife</span>.
