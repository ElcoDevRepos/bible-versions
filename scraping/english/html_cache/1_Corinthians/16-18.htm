The individuals Paul refers to are likely Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, who brought news and support from the Corinthian church. The term "refreshed" suggests a renewal or revitalization, akin to a spiritual rejuvenation. This reflects the biblical principle of mutual edification found in passages like <a href="/romans/15-32.htm">Romans 15:32</a> and <a href="/philemon/1-7.htm">Philemon 1:7</a>, where believers are encouraged to uplift one another. The communal aspect of faith is emphasized, showing that the early church valued personal connections and support, which were crucial for maintaining spiritual vitality in a challenging cultural environment.<p><b>Show your appreciation, therefore, to such men.</b><br>Paul instructs the Corinthians to recognize and honor those who serve and support the church. This directive aligns with the biblical theme of honoring those who labor in the Lord's work, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12-13</a> and <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>. The call to "show your appreciation" underscores the importance of gratitude and acknowledgment within the body of Christ. It reflects a broader biblical principle of honoring those who lead and serve, which is rooted in the understanding that such service is ultimately unto the Lord. This also serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of the church, where each member's contribution is vital to the health and growth of the community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, writing to the church in Corinth.

Scripture shows how God uses people to renew His servants:<p>&#8226; <a href="/philemon/1-7.htm">Philemon 1:7</a>: &#8220;Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_timothy/1-16.htm">2 Timothy 1:16</a>: Onesiphorus &#8220;often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.&#8221;<p>Such refreshment is more than polite kindness; it is Spirit-empowered ministry that revives zeal, steadies faith, and reminds the worker that the labor is not in vain (<a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and yours as well</b><p>Paul points out that the same men who encouraged him also strengthened the entire Corinthian church. Spiritual refreshment is never a private blessing; it spills over to others.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-13.htm">2 Corinthians 7:13</a> records a similar chain reaction: &#8220;His spirit has been refreshed by all of you. For this reason we are encouraged.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a> promises, &#8220;He who refreshes others will himself be refreshed.&#8221;<p>When believers build up one another, the whole body grows in unity and joy (<a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Show your appreciation, therefore</b><p>Gratitude is the proper response to servants who pour themselves out.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12-13</a> urges, &#8220;Recognize those who labor among you&#8230; and esteem them very highly in love because of their work.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a> adds the practical side: yielding to godly leadership &#8220;so that their work will be a joy, not a burden.&#8221;<p>Appreciation can be expressed through words of thanks, practical help, and eager cooperation with their ministry goals.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to such men</b><p>Paul is not advocating favoritism; he is highlighting a pattern worth honoring. Those who self-sacrificially serve the saints deserve visible respect. Other examples confirm the principle:<p>&#8226; <a href="/philippians/2-29.htm">Philippians 2:29-30</a>: &#8220;Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor men like him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-15.htm">1 Corinthians 16:15-16</a> mentions the household of Stephanas &#8220;devoted to the service of the saints,&#8221; calling the church to &#8220;submit to such as these.&#8221;<p>Honoring faithful workers encourages more believers to follow their example, fostering a culture where service is esteemed above status.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s words spotlight the God-given refreshment that dedicated believers bring to weary hearts. Because such ministry blesses leaders and congregations alike, Scripture calls us to notice, appreciate, and honor those who labor selflessly.
