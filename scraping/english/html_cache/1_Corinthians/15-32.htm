Ephesus was a major city in Asia Minor, known for its large amphitheater and the worship of the goddess Artemis. The phrase likely symbolizes the intense opposition and persecution Paul faced from hostile crowds or adversaries in Ephesus, as described in <a href="/acts/19.htm">Acts 19</a>. The use of "wild beasts" could also allude to the spiritual and moral challenges he encountered, emphasizing the severity of his struggles. The mention of "human motives" suggests that if his efforts were purely for earthly gain or recognition, they would be futile, highlighting the importance of eternal perspective in Christian ministry.<p><b>what did I gain?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the futility of enduring hardships for mere temporal rewards. Paul emphasizes that without the hope of resurrection, any suffering or sacrifice for the sake of the gospel would be meaningless. This reflects the broader biblical theme that true gain is found in eternal life and the promises of God, rather than in earthly achievements or comforts. It echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a> about the value of one's soul over worldly gain.<p><b>If the dead are not raised</b><br>The resurrection of the dead is a central tenet of Christian faith, affirming the victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ. Paul argues that if there is no resurrection, the entire foundation of Christian hope collapses. This statement is part of a larger discourse in <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>, where Paul defends the reality of the resurrection, both Christ's and that of believers. The resurrection is prophesied in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a> and <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, and fulfilled in the New Testament, serving as a cornerstone of Christian eschatology.<p><b>&#8220;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a quotation from <a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>, reflecting a hedonistic worldview that prioritizes immediate pleasure in the absence of belief in an afterlife. Paul uses it to illustrate the logical conclusion of denying the resurrection: if there is no future hope, then indulgence in earthly pleasures becomes the only rational pursuit. This contrasts sharply with the Christian call to live with an eternal perspective, valuing spiritual growth and obedience to God over temporary satisfaction. The phrase also serves as a warning against the dangers of adopting a secular mindset that dismisses the significance of eternal truths.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

What is the advantage or necessity of my incurring daily risks, if I am merely a human being, with a life limited by what we see, and no immortality and resurrection awaiting me?<p><span class= "bld">I have fought with beasts at Ephesus.</span>--The question here arises, Are these words to be taken literally or figuratively? Does St. Paul refer to some actual contest in the arena with beasts, or to his conflict with the opponents at Ephesus, whom he thus designates beasts? It is scarcely possible to accept the former interpretation. There is no mention to be found of it in the Acts, and, moreover, his Roman citizenship would have legally protected him against such treatment. We must therefore conclude that the Ephesians themselves are spoken of as "beasts." Both Hebrew and Greek literature would have made such a form of expression familiar to the Apostle and to his readers. In the Psalms (see <a href="/context/psalms/22-12.htm" title="Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.">Psalm 22:12-13</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/22-20.htm" title="Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.">Psalm 22:20-21</a>) the opponents of God are similarly spoken of. The Cretans are called "evil beasts" by the poet Epimenides, whom St. Paul quotes in <a href="/titus/1-12.htm" title="One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.">Titus 1:12</a>. Heraclitus calls the Ephesians "beasts"--the same word as St. Paul uses here; and St. Ignatius (<span class= "ital">Epis. ad Rom.</span>) speaks of "fighting with beasts by land and sea," and having been bound to 'ten leopards,' that is a band of soldiers."<p>Although the Greek verb implies that reference is made, not to general or prolonged opposition, but to some one outburst of rage on the part of his opponents, we must not take it as indicating the scene described in <a href="/context/acts/19-23.htm" title="And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.">Acts 19:23-34</a>, which had probably not taken place when this was written; but no doubt the "many adversaries" (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm" title="For a great door and effectual is opened to me, and there are many adversaries.">1Corinthians 16:9</a>) at Ephesus had already availed themselves of some opportunity of venting their rage on the Apostle after the manner of wild beasts (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After the manner of men.</span> The phrase is a qualification of the strong metaphor, "I fought with beasts." It is equivalent to "humanly speaking." This is Chrysostom's view. It is the most reasonable, and accords with the use of the phrase in <a href="/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-15.htm">Galatians 3:15</a>. Meyer, however, explains it to mean "with mere human motives." <span class="cmt_word">I have fought with beasts.</span> Not literally, for in that case he would have mentioned it in <a href="/2_corinthians/11.htm">2 Corinthians 11</a>. as one of his deadliest perils, and it must have been recorded by St. Luke in his full account of St. Paul's life at Ephesus. A Roman citizen was legally exempt from this mode of punishment. The word points to some special peril incurred in resisting the hostility of the worshippers of Artemis (<a href="/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>), but not to the tumult in the theatre, which did not happen till after this letter was despatched (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-8.htm">1 Corinthians 16:8, 9</a>). The metaphor is not uncommon. Thus in <a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a> St. Paul alludes to Nero (probably) as "the lion." David often compares his enemies to wild beasts (<a href="/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a>, etc.). When his jailor informed Agrippa of the death of Tiberius, he did so in the words, "The lion is dead." St. Ignatius writes of the ten soldiers who were conducting him to Rome as "ten leopards." Epimenides, in the line quoted by St. Paul in <a href="/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a>, spoke of the Cretans as "evil wild beasts," and the pseudo-Heraclitus gives this same uncomplimentary title to these very Ephesians. <span class="cmt_word">Let as eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.</span> Perhaps the "if the dead are not raised" belongs to this clause. He means that such an Epicurean maxim, if never <span class="accented">excusable</span>, would at least be <span class="accented">natural</span>, if men could only look to life in the present. The sentiment is found on the lips of the despairing and the sensual alike in <a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>, and in the writings of the heathen (Horace, 'Od.,' 1:4, 13-17, etc.). St. Paul would be all the more familiar with it because it formed the infamous epitaph of a statue of Sardauapalus, which he must have often seen in his boyhood at Anchiale, near Tarsus. It represented the debased king as snapping his fingers, and using almost these very words. It is strange that similar passages should be found even in the Talmud. Shemuel said to Rav Yehudah, "Seize and eat, seize and drink; for the world is like a wedding feast (soon over)" ('Eiruvin,' fol. 54, 1). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/15-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
