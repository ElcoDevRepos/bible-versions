Paul addresses the Corinthian church, which was a diverse group with varying levels of spiritual maturity. Some believers understood the theological truth that idols have no real existence, while others, particularly those who had recently converted from paganism, struggled with this concept. This highlights the importance of sensitivity and patience within the Christian community, recognizing that not all members have reached the same level of spiritual insight.<p><b>Some people are still so accustomed to idols</b><br>Corinth was a city steeped in idolatry, with numerous temples and a culture that revolved around pagan worship. Many converts to Christianity came from this background and retained strong associations with their former practices. The phrase indicates the lingering influence of past beliefs and the difficulty some believers faced in fully embracing the monotheistic faith. This cultural context underscores the challenge of transitioning from a polytheistic worldview to the exclusive worship of the one true God.<p><b>that they eat such food as if it were sacrificed to an idol.</b><br>In ancient Corinth, meat sold in the marketplace often came from animals sacrificed in pagan temples. For some believers, eating such meat was tantamount to participating in idol worship. This reflects the struggle between newfound Christian convictions and ingrained cultural practices. The issue was not merely dietary but deeply spiritual, as it involved the conscience and the perception of participating in idolatry. This situation required discernment and a careful approach to avoid causing others to stumble in their faith.<p><b>And since their conscience is weak,</b><br>A "weak conscience" refers to a lack of confidence in one's understanding of Christian liberty and the implications of faith. These believers were not yet fully assured of their freedom in Christ and were easily troubled by actions they perceived as sinful. The concept of a weak conscience is significant in understanding the pastoral care needed within the church, emphasizing the need for stronger believers to act with love and consideration for those who are still growing in their faith.<p><b>it is defiled.</b><br>The defilement of the conscience occurs when a believer acts against their convictions, even if the action is not inherently sinful. For those with a weak conscience, eating food associated with idols violated their sense of right and wrong, leading to spiritual distress. This highlights the principle that actions must be guided by faith and a clear conscience, as anything done without faith is sin (<a href="/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a>). The defilement underscores the importance of nurturing a clear and informed conscience through the study of Scripture and reliance on the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth regarding issues of conscience and knowledge.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece known for its diverse population and prevalent idol worship, which influenced the local church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship in pagan religions, significant in Corinthian society, leading to conflicts for new Christians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>A diverse group of believers struggling with issues of conscience, knowledge, and cultural practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/food_sacrificed_to_idols.htm">Food Sacrificed to Idols</a></b><br>A common practice in Corinth, creating a dilemma for Christians about whether eating such food was permissible.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_knowledge_and_conscience.htm">Understanding Knowledge and Conscience</a></b><br>Knowledge must be tempered with love and consideration for others' consciences.<br><br>A strong conscience is informed by a mature understanding of Christian liberty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respecting_weaker_brethren.htm">Respecting Weaker Brethren</a></b><br>Christians should be sensitive to the consciences of those who are weaker in faith.<br><br>Avoid actions that might lead others to sin or feel defiled.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_idolatry_in_christian_life.htm">The Role of Idolatry in Christian Life</a></b><br>Recognize the pervasive influence of idolatry in society and its potential impact on believers.<br><br>Maintain a clear distinction between cultural practices and Christian beliefs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/building_up_the_church_community.htm">Building Up the Church Community</a></b><br>Encourage unity and edification within the church by prioritizing the spiritual well-being of others.<br><br>Use personal freedom responsibly to foster a supportive and loving community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_out_christian_liberty.htm">Living Out Christian Liberty</a></b><br>Exercise freedom in Christ with a focus on glorifying God and serving others.<br><br>Balance personal convictions with the collective conscience of the church body.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_8_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 8:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_8_7_on_weak_faith_consciences.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 8:7 address the issue of weak consciences in faith?

True maturity willingly limits personal freedom for the sake of another&#8217;s holiness, following the Savior who laid down His rights to lift us up (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge.</span>--The Apostle had admitted that in theory all have knowledge which should render the eating of things offered to idols a matter beyond question; but there are some who, as a matter of fact, are not fully grown--have not practically attained that knowledge.<p><span class= "bld">Some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">some, through their familiarity with the idol, even up to this time eat it as offered to an idol.</span><p>The weight of MSS. evidence is in favour of the word "familiarity" instead of the word "conscience," and joins "even up to this time," not with "eat," but with the previous words. Thus the allusion is to heathen converts who, from their previous lifelong belief in the reality of the idol as representing a god, have not been able fully to realise the non-existence of the person thus represented, though they have come to believe that it is not God; and therefore, they regard the meat as offered to some kind of reality, even though it be a demon. (See <a href="/context/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1Corinthians 10:20-21</a>.)

St Paul admits that this was the sign of a conscience intellectually weak; but the weakness was the result of past habit and imperfect enlightenment, and it was entitled to forbearance and respect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#955;&#955;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(All&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
