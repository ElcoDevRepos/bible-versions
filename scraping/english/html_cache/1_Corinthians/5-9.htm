This suggests that Paul's correspondence with the Corinthians was ongoing and that he was addressing specific issues within the church. The existence of this earlier letter highlights the importance of understanding the context and the ongoing relationship between Paul and the Corinthian believers. It also underscores the pastoral care Paul had for the churches he established, as he continued to guide them even from a distance.<p><b>not to associate</b><br>The term "associate" implies a level of fellowship or close relationship. In the context of the early church, association would have included sharing meals, worship, and communal activities. The instruction not to associate is a call for the church to maintain purity and holiness, reflecting the call to be separate from sin. This echoes Old Testament principles where Israel was instructed to be distinct from the surrounding nations (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>). The idea is not to completely isolate from the world but to avoid intimate connections that could lead to moral compromise.<p><b>with sexually immoral people</b><br>Sexual immorality, or "porneia" in Greek, encompasses a range of illicit sexual behaviors outside the bounds of biblical marriage. In the Greco-Roman world, sexual immorality was rampant and often intertwined with pagan religious practices. The Corinthian church, situated in a city known for its moral laxity, faced significant challenges in maintaining sexual purity. This instruction aligns with the broader biblical teaching on sexual ethics, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</a> and <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>. It also reflects the call to holiness found throughout Scripture, where believers are urged to live lives that honor God, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the church in Corinth.

In his authoritative, Spirit-inspired letter, he instructs believers to withdraw close fellowship from anyone inside the church who persists in sexual immorality. The purpose is twofold: to maintain the church&#8217;s purity and to prompt the sinner to repent and be restored. This timeless standard, rooted in love and holiness, continues to safeguard Christ&#8217;s community and uphold the truth of the gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">I wrote unto you in an epistle.</span>--These words have given rise to some controversy as to whether the Apostle here refers to some former Epistle addressed to the Corinthian Church, and which has not been preserved, or whether the reference is not to this Epistle itself. It has been suggested by some who adopt the latter view that these words may have been added as an interpolation after the completion of the Epistle, and be intended to intensify the remarks made by the Apostle on this subject in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?">1Corinthians 5:6-8</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,">1Corinthians 6:9-20</a>. Such an interpretation, however, seems rather strained. It is more natural to suppose that the reference is to an Epistle written to the Corinthians, probably from Ephesus, after a visit paid to Corinth of which we have no record, for in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-14.htm" title="Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.">2Corinthians 12:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.">2Corinthians 13:1</a>, we read of a third visit being contemplated, whereas only one previous one is recorded. (See also <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) The condition of the Church which caused the Apostle that "heaviness," which he connects with this visit in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.">2Corinthians 2:1</a>, would naturally have given rise to an Epistle containing the kind of direction here referred to.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-13.</span> - <span class="accented">Correction of a mistaken inference which they had deduced from a former letter of St. Paul's.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In an Epistle;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in</span> the <span class="accented">Epistle</span>; <span class="accented">in</span> some former letter to the Church, which is no longer extant (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>).

The notion that "the Epistle" intended is <span class="accented">this</span> Epistle is an absurdity invented in the interests of the same fiction.
