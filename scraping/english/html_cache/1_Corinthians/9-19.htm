As an apostle, he is not bound by human authority or traditions. This freedom is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, emphasizing the believer's liberation from the law (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). Historically, Corinth was a city known for its diverse population and cultural influences, which may have pressured individuals to conform. Paul&#8217;s statement highlights his independence from these societal expectations.<p><b>I make myself a slave to everyone</b><br>Despite his freedom, Paul chooses to become a servant to all. This reflects the example of Jesus, who, though divine, took on the form of a servant (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>). In the Greco-Roman world, slavery was a common institution, and Paul's use of this metaphor would have been powerful, illustrating total commitment and humility. This voluntary servitude is a strategic choice to connect with people across different cultural and social backgrounds.<p><b>to win as many as possible</b><br>Paul's ultimate goal is evangelism, driven by a desire to bring others to Christ. This mission aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and reflects the heart of God, who desires all to be saved (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). The phrase underscores the urgency and importance of spreading the Gospel, as well as Paul's willingness to adapt his approach to reach diverse groups, whether Jews, Gentiles, or those under the law (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20-22</a>). This adaptability is not compromise but a strategic effort to remove barriers to the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and extensive writings.

Paul literally stands before God with no earthly master, echoing &#8220;You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-23.htm">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>).<p>&#8226; He reminds us that believers, redeemed by Christ, are unshackled from every human demand that would hinder obedience to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I make myself a slave to everyone</b><p>&#8220;I make myself a slave to everyone&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19</a>)<p>&#8226; Out of that very freedom Paul voluntarily bends low for others&#8217; good, modeling the Savior who &#8220;emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This is a choice, not coercion.

"For" though an Apostle, I became a slave of all that I might gain the greater number.
