Paul addresses the problem of factions forming around different leaders, which is contrary to the unity that should characterize the body of Christ. The emphasis here is on preventing any claims that could lead to further division. This reflects the broader biblical theme of unity in the church, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3-6</a>, which calls for maintaining the unity of the Spirit.<p><b>that you were baptized</b><br>Baptism in the early church was a significant rite of initiation, symbolizing the believer's identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>). In the context of Corinth, a city known for its diverse religious practices, baptism marked a clear break from pagan traditions and a commitment to the Christian faith. The act of baptism was not just a personal declaration but a public testimony of faith in Christ.<p><b>into my name</b><br>Paul is concerned that the Corinthians might mistakenly attribute their spiritual allegiance to him rather than to Christ. In the Greco-Roman world, names held significant power and identity, often associated with authority and allegiance. By emphasizing that baptism should not be in his name, Paul underscores the centrality of Christ in the believer's life. This aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands baptism in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, highlighting the Trinitarian foundation of Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Corinthians, addressing issues within the church at Corinth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>A diverse and divided early Christian community in the city of Corinth, known for its moral and spiritual challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/baptism.htm">Baptism</a></b><br>A Christian sacrament of initiation and purification, symbolizing the believer's faith in Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/chloe's_household.htm">Chloe's Household</a></b><br>Mentioned earlier in the chapter as the source of information about the divisions in the Corinthian church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/apollos_and_cephas.htm">Apollos and Cephas (Peter)</a></b><br>Other leaders in the early church mentioned in the broader context of the chapter, representing different factions within the Corinthian church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_christ.htm">Unity in Christ</a></b><br>The focus of baptism is on Christ, not on the individual performing it.
