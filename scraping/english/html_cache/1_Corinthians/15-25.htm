It reflects the fulfillment of God's sovereign plan, as prophesied in the Old Testament. <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a> is a key reference, where David speaks of the Messiah sitting at God's right hand until His enemies are made a footstool. The reign of Christ is both a present reality and a future hope, as He currently reigns in the hearts of believers and will ultimately reign over all creation. This reign is part of the divine order established by God, underscoring the certainty and authority of Christ's kingship.<p><b>until He has put all His enemies</b><br>The phrase indicates a process and a timeline in God's redemptive plan. The enemies of Christ include sin, death, and all spiritual forces opposed to God's kingdom. This reflects the ongoing spiritual battle described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where believers are called to stand against the powers of darkness. Historically, this struggle has been evident in the persecution of the church and the resistance to the gospel. The ultimate defeat of these enemies is assured, as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>, where the Son of Man is given dominion over all nations.<p><b>under His feet.</b><br>This imagery of subjugation is drawn from ancient Near Eastern practices, where a victorious king would place his foot on the neck of a defeated enemy, symbolizing total conquest. Biblically, it signifies Christ's complete victory over all opposition. This is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/2-8.htm">Hebrews 2:8</a>, which speaks of everything being subjected to Christ, though we do not yet see everything in subjection. The phrase also connects to <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, the protoevangelium, where the seed of the woman is promised to crush the serpent's head, foreshadowing Christ's ultimate triumph over Satan and evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, who is reigning and will ultimately defeat all His enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Refers to all forces opposed to Christ, including sin, death, and spiritual adversaries.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth about the resurrection and the ultimate victory of Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>The city where the church Paul is addressing is located, known for its diverse culture and challenges to Christian living.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection.htm">Resurrection</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>, focusing on the resurrection of Christ and its implications for believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_sovereign_reign.htm">Christ's Sovereign Reign</a></b><br>Jesus is currently reigning, and His authority is supreme.
