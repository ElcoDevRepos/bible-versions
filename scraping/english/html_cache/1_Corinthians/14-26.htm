The term "brothers" indicates a familial relationship among believers, emphasizing unity and shared faith. Paul often uses this term to address the church, highlighting the importance of community and mutual respect within the body of Christ.<p><b>When you come together,</b><br>The early Christian church placed a strong emphasis on gathering together for worship and fellowship. This phrase underscores the communal aspect of early Christian worship, which was often held in homes or small gatherings. The act of coming together was central to the practice of faith, reflecting the teachings of Jesus about the importance of community (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>).<p><b>everyone has a psalm or a teaching,</b><br>In the early church, worship was participatory, with each member contributing to the service. A "psalm" refers to a song or hymn, often from the Book of Psalms, used in worship. A "teaching" involves instruction or sharing of doctrine, reflecting the Jewish tradition of teaching in synagogues. This practice aligns with the Jewish roots of Christianity, where learning and singing were integral to worship.<p><b>a revelation,</b><br>Revelation here refers to a divine insight or message given by the Holy Spirit. In the early church, prophecy and revelations were common as the New Testament was not yet fully compiled. This reflects the dynamic nature of early Christian worship, where the Holy Spirit actively guided the congregation (<a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17-18</a>).<p><b>a tongue, or an interpretation.</b><br>Speaking in tongues, or glossolalia, was a spiritual gift where believers spoke in languages unknown to them. Interpretation was necessary for the edification of the church, ensuring that the message was understood by all. This practice is rooted in the events of Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4-11</a>) and highlights the diversity and unity of the early church.<p><b>All of these must be done to build up the church.</b><br>The ultimate purpose of these spiritual gifts and practices was the edification of the church. Paul emphasizes that all activities within the church should contribute to its growth and strengthening. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of building up the body of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-13</a>), ensuring that all actions serve the common good and reflect the love and unity taught by Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on orderly worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and spiritually gifted congregation facing issues of disorder and division in their gatherings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_gifts.htm">Spiritual Gifts</a></b><br>Various gifts such as hymns, teachings, revelations, tongues, and interpretations mentioned as part of the worship service.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its cultural diversity and moral challenges, influencing the church's dynamics.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_worship.htm">Early Christian Worship</a></b><br>The context in which believers gathered, bringing different contributions to the communal worship experience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/order_in_worship.htm">Order in Worship</a></b><br>Worship should be conducted in an orderly manner to ensure that all contributions serve the purpose of edification.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/diversity_of_gifts.htm">Diversity of Gifts</a></b><br>Each believer has unique gifts to contribute, and these should be used to build up the church, not for personal glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_of_gathering.htm">Purpose of Gathering</a></b><br>The primary goal of coming together as a church is mutual edification and spiritual growth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_participation.htm">Active Participation</a></b><br>Every member is encouraged to participate actively in worship, bringing their gifts to benefit the whole congregation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/focus_on_edification.htm">Focus on Edification</a></b><br>All activities within the church service should aim to strengthen and encourage the faith of the community.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_14_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 14:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ensure_gatherings_edify_per_1_Cor_14_26.htm">How can we ensure our gatherings are for "edification" as in 1 Corinthians 14:26?

Diversity of gifts, expressed in love and clarity, leads to a gathering where Christ is glorified and His people are built up together.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">How is it then, brethren?</span>--From a discussion as to the relative value of the gift of tongue and that of prophecy, the Apostle now turns to practical instructions as to the method of their employment in public church assemblies. He first gives directions regarding the tongues (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-27.htm" title="If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.">1Corinthians 14:27-28</a>), then regarding prophecy (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-29.htm" title="Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.">1Corinthians 14:29-36</a>), and the concluding verses of this chapter contain a summing up and brief repetition of what has been already laid down. In this verse he introduces the practical application of the truths which he has been enforcing, by the question, "How is it, then?"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> what should follow from all these arguments?--and, instead of answering the question directly, he first recalls the existing state of confusion in their public assemblies, which had rendered necessary the teaching of the previous verses, and which is to be remedied by the practical instructions which now follow.<p><span class= "bld">When ye come together, every one of you hath . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">when ye are assembling together each one of you hath a psalm, &c.</span> The uppermost thought in each mind as you are assembling for public worship is the individual gift which he possesses. One had the gift of pouring forth a psalm of praise; another could deliver a doctrinal discourse; another could speak to God in a tongue; another had some deep insight into the spiritual world; another could interpret the tongue. If these varied gifts were employed by each for his own gratification, or even for his own spiritual advancement, they would not be used worthy of the occasion. In public these gifts were to be exercised not by each one for himself, but for the building up of the whole Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-33.</span> - <span class="accented">Rules to check disorderly self-assertion in Christian assemblies.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How is it then?</span> The same phrase as in ver. 15. <span class="cmt_word">Every one of you hath a psalm,</span> etc. We see here a somewhat melancholy picture of the struggling self assertion of rival claimants to attention. <span class="cmt_word">A doctrine;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a teaching</span>, The glossolaly had probably been promoted by Syrian enthusiasts, perhaps of the Petrine party; the egotism of oratory and itch of teaching now described (<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>) may have been developed in the Apollonian party. <span class="cmt_word">Unto edifying.</span> The object is moral improvement, not idle self display, not the ostentation of individual gifts (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7, 8, 10</a>).
