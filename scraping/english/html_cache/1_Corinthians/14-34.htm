The early church often met in homes, and the structure of these gatherings was influenced by Jewish synagogue practices, where women traditionally did not speak. This instruction aligns with the broader biblical theme of order and propriety in worship settings, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11-12</a>, which also emphasizes quietness and submission for women in the church.<p><b>They are not permitted to speak,</b><br>This phrase underscores the idea of maintaining order during worship services. In the Greco-Roman world, public speaking was a significant aspect of leadership and authority, and this restriction may have been intended to prevent disorder or confusion during church meetings. The emphasis on silence can be seen as a way to uphold the unity and focus of the congregation, ensuring that worship remains centered on God rather than individual expression.<p><b>but must be in submission,</b><br>Submission here is often interpreted as a reflection of the created order, as outlined in passages like <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>, where wives are called to submit to their husbands as the church submits to Christ. This concept of submission is not about inferiority but about fulfilling God-given roles within the church and family. It is a call to respect and uphold the leadership structure established within the church community.<p><b>as the law says.</b><br>This reference to "the law" likely points to the Old Testament, where principles of order and roles within the community are established. <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>, which speaks of the consequences of the Fall, is often cited in discussions of gender roles, as well as the broader Mosaic Law, which set guidelines for community conduct.
