This shift highlights the new covenant and the significance of the resurrection in Christian worship. The first day of the week became a time for communal worship and reflection on the risen Christ, as seen in <a href="/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>.<p><b>each of you should set aside a portion of his income</b><br>Paul emphasizes personal responsibility in giving, suggesting that every believer, regardless of their financial status, should participate in supporting the church and its mission. This practice reflects the principle of stewardship found throughout Scripture, where believers are called to manage their resources for God's glory (<a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>). The act of setting aside a portion also mirrors the Old Testament practice of tithing, though it is not a legalistic requirement but a voluntary act of worship and gratitude.<p><b>saving it up</b><br>This phrase suggests intentionality and planning in giving. It implies that believers should be thoughtful and deliberate in their financial contributions, ensuring that they are prepared to give when the need arises. This approach contrasts with impulsive or sporadic giving and aligns with the biblical principle of being a cheerful giver (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<p><b>so that when I come no collections will be needed</b><br>Paul's instruction here is practical, aiming to ensure that the collection for the Jerusalem church is ready upon his arrival, avoiding last-minute efforts. This reflects Paul's organizational skills and his desire for orderly worship and administration within the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>). It also underscores the importance of supporting fellow believers, as the collection was intended to aid the impoverished church in Jerusalem, fostering unity and mutual care within the body of Christ (<a href="/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, providing guidance to the Corinthian church on orderly giving.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and dynamic early Christian community in Corinth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_church.htm">Jerusalem Church</a></b><br>The intended beneficiaries of the collection, experiencing poverty and in need of support.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/first_day_of_the_week.htm">First Day of the Week</a></b><br>Sunday, significant as the day of Christ's resurrection and the early Christian gathering for worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/collection_for_the_saints.htm">Collection for the Saints</a></b><br>A financial offering intended to support the believers in Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/regular_and_intentional_giving.htm">Regular and Intentional Giving</a></b><br>Paul instructs believers to set aside a portion of their income regularly.

Already the day of the week on which Christ had risen had become noted as a suitable day for distinctively Christian work and Christian worship. It does not yet seem to have been designated by the phrase by which it became subsequently universally known in Christendom--"the Lord's Day;" that name occurs first in <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>. This would be a convenient as well as a suitable day for each one to set aside, as he had proposed, something, storing it up until the Apostle's arrival; for this was already the usual day for Christians assembling themselves together (<a href="/acts/20-7.htm" title="And on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.">Acts 20:7</a>). I cannot think with Stanley and others that the Apostle means that each was to lay by "in his own house," and not in some general treasury. The object of this direction is expressly stated to be that the money should all be ready in bulk-sum when the Apostle came, so that his time and that of the Christian community during his visit might not be occupied with this, but with more profitable matters, which result would not have been accomplished if the offering had then to be gathered from each Christian home.<p><span class= "bld">As God hath prospered him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">whatsoever he may be prospered in.</span> These words do not imply that only in cases of exceptional prosperity was a man to contribute, but every man was to give out of whatever fruits he had from his labour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon the first day of the week.</span> <span class="accented">This</span> verse can hardly be said to imply any religious observance of the Sunday, which rests rather on <a href="/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>; <a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19, 26</a>.
