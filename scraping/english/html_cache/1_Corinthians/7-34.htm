In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/7.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>, Paul addresses the challenges faced by those who are married, as their attention is split between serving God and fulfilling marital responsibilities. This division is not inherently negative but reflects the practical realities of married life. The concept of divided interests can be seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>, where Jesus speaks about the cost of discipleship and the need for prioritizing Him above all else.<p><b>The unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the work of the Lord,</b><br>Paul emphasizes the advantage of singleness in terms of undivided devotion to God. In the early church, unmarried women often played significant roles in ministry, as seen in <a href="/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a>, where Philip's four unmarried daughters prophesied. The cultural context of the time placed high value on marriage, yet Paul presents singleness as a viable and even preferable option for those called to serve God without distraction.<p><b>how she can be holy in both body and spirit.</b><br>Holiness in body and spirit reflects a comprehensive dedication to God, encompassing both physical actions and spiritual devotion. This dual focus on body and spirit aligns with the holistic view of human nature found in scripture, such as in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to present their bodies as living sacrifices. The call to holiness is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, emphasizing purity and dedication to God's service.<p><b>But the married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world,</b><br>Paul acknowledges the legitimate concerns of married life, which include managing household responsibilities and nurturing family relationships. These "affairs of this world" are not sinful but are part of the God-ordained structure of marriage. The historical context of the Greco-Roman world placed significant expectations on women to manage domestic affairs, which could limit their ability to engage in ministry activities.<p><b>how she can please her husband.</b><br>The focus on pleasing one's husband reflects the biblical teaching on the roles within marriage, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>, where wives are instructed to submit to their husbands as to the Lord. This submission is part of the mutual love and respect that characterizes a Christian marriage. The cultural context of the time emphasized the importance of harmony and duty within the household, which Paul acknowledges while also highlighting the potential for divided focus in serving God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on marriage and singleness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/unmarried_woman/virgin.htm">Unmarried Woman/Virgin</a></b><br>Refers to women who are not married, highlighting their potential focus on spiritual matters.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/married_woman.htm">Married Woman</a></b><br>Represents women who are married, emphasizing their responsibilities towards their husbands.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and moral challenges, where the early church faced various issues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, the central figure of Christian faith, whom believers are encouraged to serve wholeheartedly.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/singleness_as_a_gift.htm">Singleness as a Gift</a></b><br>Recognize singleness as an opportunity to devote oneself fully to the Lord without the divided interests that marriage may bring.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_body_and_spirit.htm">Holiness in Body and Spirit</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of maintaining purity and spiritual focus, whether married or unmarried.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_responsibilities.htm">Balancing Responsibilities</a></b><br>For married individuals, balance the responsibilities of marriage with a commitment to serving God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contentment_in_one's_season.htm">Contentment in One's Season</a></b><br>Encourage contentment and faithfulness in whatever season of life one is in, trusting God's plan and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pleasing_god_first.htm">Pleasing God First</a></b><br>Prioritize pleasing God above all, whether in singleness or marriage, ensuring that earthly relationships do not overshadow one's relationship with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_7_34_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 7:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_7_34_Unmarried_woman_s_focus.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 7:34 define the focus of an unmarried woman?

The principle is simple: when two legitimate callings compete for time, focus is necessarily &#8220;divided.&#8221; Jesus warned Martha about being &#8220;worried and upset about many things&#8221; while Mary chose the &#8220;one thing&#8221; that mattered most (<a href="/luke/10-41.htm">Luke 10:41-42</a>). In the same way, <a href="/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15-17</a> cautions us not to let even good earthly responsibilities crowd out devotion to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the affairs of the Lord</b><p>An unmarried believer enjoys a freedom that allows single-minded service&#8212;much like Anna, who &#8220;never left the temple but worshiped night and day&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36-37</a>), or Philip&#8217;s four unmarried daughters who &#8220;prophesied&#8221; (<a href="/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a>).

Paul&#8217;s goal is that every believer &#8220;present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>; see also <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>). The single woman may channel her energies toward spiritual growth, stewardship of her body, and wholehearted worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world</b><p>Marriage is God-ordained (<a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18-24</a>) and good, yet it introduces unavoidable earthly tasks: budgeting, cooking, child-rearing, relational maintenance. Scripture commends these roles (<a href="/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27</a>; <a href="/titus/2-4.htm">Titus 2:4-5</a>), but they demand time and mental bandwidth that might otherwise be available for direct ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How she can please her husband</b><p>A godly wife rightly seeks to bless her husband (<a href="/ephesians/5-33.htm">Ephesians 5:33</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a>). Meeting his emotional, physical, and spiritual needs is a holy calling, yet Paul points out that it limits the hours she can devote exclusively to overt ministry pursuits. The issue is priority, not piety&#8212;marriage shifts some focus horizontally without negating vertical devotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/7-34.htm">1 Corinthians 7:34</a> contrasts the life-situations of single and married women to show why singleness can offer undivided attention to the Lord. Paul does not elevate one status over the other; he simply observes that earthly responsibilities differ. Singles may leverage freedom for intensified service and holiness, while married believers glorify God by faithfully caring for spouse and home. Both callings are honorable; each has its own set of God-given priorities.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is difference also,</span> etc. The reading, punctuation, and exact sense are surrounded with uncertainty, which does not, however, affect the general meaning. This is probably given correctly in our English Version. He implies that the married woman must of necessity be more of a Martha than a Mary. Nevertheless, two things are certain: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that God intended marriage to be the normal lot; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that marriage is by no means incompatible with the most absolute saintliness. <p>It is probable that most, if not all, of the apostles were married men (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>). The spirit of St. Paul's advice - the avoidance of distraction, and the determination that our duty to God shall not be impaired by earthly relationships - remains eternally significant. Another common way of punctuating the words is, "The married man cares.., how he may please his wife, <span class="accented">and is divided</span> [in interests]." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/7-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[his interests] are divided.</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#956;&#941;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(memeristai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3307.htm">Strong's 3307: </a> </span><span class="str2">From meros; to part, i.e. to apportion, bestow, share, or to disunite, differ.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
