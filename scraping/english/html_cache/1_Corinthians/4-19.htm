This reflects his pastoral care and desire to address issues personally. The phrase indicates urgency and a direct approach to resolving conflicts. Paul's travels were extensive, and his missionary journeys are well-documented in Acts, showing his commitment to the churches he established.<p><b>if the Lord is willing</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's sovereignty over human plans, echoing <a href="/james/4-15.htm">James 4:15</a>, which advises believers to say, "If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that." It reflects a deep trust in God's providence and a recognition that all plans are subject to His divine will.<p><b>and then I will find out not only what these arrogant people are saying</b><br>Paul addresses the issue of arrogance within the Corinthian church. The term "arrogant" suggests a prideful attitude that contradicts the humility taught by Christ. This echoes the broader theme in 1 Corinthians of addressing divisions and pride within the church. Paul intends to confront these individuals directly, emphasizing the importance of truth and accountability.<p><b>but what power they have</b><br>Paul contrasts mere words with true spiritual power, reminiscent of <a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>, where he speaks of his message coming with a demonstration of the Spirit's power.
