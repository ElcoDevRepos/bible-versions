In the early church, many converts came from pagan backgrounds and struggled with the remnants of their former beliefs. The "weak conscience" indicates a sensitivity to practices that might seem idolatrous, even if they are not inherently sinful. <a href="/romans/14.htm">Romans 14:1-2</a> also addresses the issue of differing levels of faith and understanding among believers.<p><b>sees you who are well informed</b><br>The "well informed" are those who possess a mature understanding of Christian freedom and the knowledge that idols have no real existence (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>). This knowledge, however, must be tempered with love and consideration for others (<a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>). The mature believer understands that eating food offered to idols is not inherently wrong, but must consider the impact on others.<p><b>eating in an idol&#8217;s temple</b><br>In Corinth, temples were central to social and religious life, often serving as venues for communal meals. Archaeological findings reveal that these temples were not only places of worship but also social hubs. Eating in such a setting could be seen as participating in idol worship, which was a significant concern for early Christians trying to distance themselves from pagan practices (<a href="/acts/15-29.htm">Acts 15:29</a>).<p><b>will he not be encouraged to eat food sacrificed to idols?</b><br>The concern here is that the actions of the knowledgeable believer might lead the weaker brother to violate his conscience, thinking that such participation is acceptable. This could cause spiritual harm, as acting against one's conscience is considered sinful (<a href="/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a>).

It was indeed a "bowing in the house of Rimmon" which could hardly fail to be misunderstood. The very word "idoleum" should have warned them. It was a word not used by Gentiles, and invented by believers in the one God, to avoid the use of "temple" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) in connection with idols. The Greeks spoke of the "Athenaeum," or "Apolloneum," or "Posideum;" but Jews only of an "idoleum" - a word which (like other Jewish designations of heathen forms of worship) involved a bitter taunt. For the very word <span class="accented">eidolon</span> meant a shadowy, fleeting, unreal image. Perhaps the Corinthian Christians might excuse their boldness by pleading that all the most important feasts and social gatherings of the ancients were held in temples (comp. 1 Macc. 1:47 1 Macc. 10:83). <span class="cmt_word">Be emboldened;</span> rather, <span class="accented">be edified.</span> The expression is a very bold paronomasia. This "edification of ruin" would be all the more likely to ensue because self interest would plead powerfully in the same direction. A little compromise and complicity, a little suppression of opinion and avoidance of antagonism to things evil, a little immoral acquiescence, would have gone very far in those days to save Christians from incessant persecution. Yet no Christian could be "edified" into a more dangerous course than that of defying and defiling his own tender conscience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/8-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#940;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
