In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>, Paul addresses the diversity of spiritual gifts within the church, underscoring that despite the variety, they all originate from the same Spirit. This reflects the monotheistic belief central to Christianity, where the Holy Spirit is part of the Trinity. The Spirit's work is seen throughout Scripture, from the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> to the empowering of believers in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>. The unity of the Spirit is a call for harmony within the church, as all gifts serve the common good and the edification of the body of Christ.<p><b>who apportions them to each one</b><br>The distribution of gifts is not random but intentional, as the Spirit apportions them to each believer. This highlights the sovereignty of God in the administration of spiritual gifts. The term "apportions" suggests a deliberate and purposeful allocation, ensuring that each member of the body of Christ has a role to play. This concept is mirrored in <a href="/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6-8</a>, where Paul speaks of differing gifts according to the grace given to each. The individual distribution underscores the personal relationship between the believer and the Holy Spirit, as well as the unique contribution each person is meant to make to the church.<p><b>as He determines</b><br>The Spirit's determination in the distribution of gifts points to divine wisdom and purpose. This phrase assures believers that their gifts are not a result of human merit or effort but are given according to the Spirit's will. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/4-7.htm">Ephesians 4:7</a>, where grace is given according to the measure of Christ's gift. The Spirit's determination ensures that the church functions effectively, with each member contributing to the whole. It also serves as a reminder of the Spirit's omniscience and omnipotence, knowing what is best for the church and each individual within it. This divine determination calls for trust and humility among believers, recognizing that the Spirit's plan is perfect and purposeful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostle_paul.htm">Apostle Paul</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul was writing to the church in Corinth to address various issues, including spiritual gifts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and cultural influences, which also affected the church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_spirit.htm">Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who is responsible for distributing spiritual gifts to believers according to His will.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a diverse group of believers struggling with issues of unity and spiritual maturity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_gifts.htm">Spiritual Gifts</a></b><br>Special abilities given by the Holy Spirit to believers for the purpose of building up the church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_the_spirit.htm">The Sovereignty of the Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is sovereign in distributing gifts.
