The concept of a "believing wife" emphasizes the importance of shared faith in marriage, aligning with teachings in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a> about being equally yoked. The early church valued the support and partnership of a spouse in ministry, reflecting the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a> where God provides a helper suitable for Adam. This also counters any ascetic views that might suggest celibacy as a superior spiritual state, affirming the sanctity and purpose of marriage.<p><b>as do the other apostles</b><br>Paul references the practices of other apostles to establish a precedent for his argument. This implies that it was common for apostles to be married and for their wives to accompany them, suggesting a model of family involvement in ministry. The apostles, as foundational leaders of the church, set examples for Christian living, including the integration of family life and ministry. This practice is consistent with Jewish customs of the time, where rabbis and religious leaders often had families.<p><b>and the Lord&#8217;s brothers</b><br>The mention of the Lord&#8217;s brothers, likely referring to James, Jude, and others, indicates that Jesus' own family members were involved in early church leadership and were married. This highlights the normalcy of marriage among early Christian leaders and counters any claims that celibacy was a requirement for spiritual leadership. It also underscores the transformation of Jesus' brothers from skeptics (<a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>) to leaders in the church (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>), demonstrating the power of the resurrection and the Holy Spirit in changing lives.<p><b>and Cephas?</b><br>Cephas, also known as Peter, is specifically mentioned, emphasizing his prominent role among the apostles. Peter's marriage is noted in the Gospels, as Jesus healed his mother-in-law (<a href="/matthew/8-14.htm">Matthew 8:14-15</a>). This reference to Peter reinforces the argument that marriage and ministry are compatible and that key leaders in the early church, including those closest to Jesus, were married. Peter's leadership and his marital status serve as a model for balancing family responsibilities with spiritual duties, reflecting the holistic approach to life and ministry in the early church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle writing this letter to the Corinthians, defending his rights as an apostle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/other_apostles.htm">Other Apostles</a></b><br>Refers to the other leaders in the early Christian church who were recognized as apostles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_brothers.htm">The Lord&#8217;s Brothers</a></b><br>Likely refers to James, Jude, and possibly other siblings of Jesus who were involved in the early church.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cephas.htm">Cephas</a></b><br>Another name for Peter, one of the leading apostles and a key figure in the early church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>The city where the church Paul is addressing is located, known for its diverse and often morally lax culture.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/apostolic_rights_and_responsibilities.htm">Apostolic Rights and Responsibilities</a></b><br>Paul asserts his rights as an apostle, including the right to marry and have a family.

In the immediate context he says, &#8220;Don&#8217;t we have the right to food and drink?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-4.htm">1 Corinthians 9:4</a>). The next verse adds the matter of family support.<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;right&#8221; highlights that this is not a luxury but a legitimate claim. Paul later affirms, &#8220;In the same way, the Lord has prescribed that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-14.htm">1 Corinthians 9:14</a>; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a> applied in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-9.htm">1 Corinthians 9:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Although Paul often surrenders his rights for the sake of the gospel (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12, 18</a>), he insists the right itself is real and scriptural.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To take along a believing wife</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Believing&#8221; shows the spiritual harmony expected in Christian marriage (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-39.htm">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Take along&#8221; implies travel in ministry. Maintaining marriage and family life on the road was not selfish; it honored God&#8217;s design that &#8220;the two shall become one flesh&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/19-5.htm">Matthew 19:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse also answers any suggestion that serving Christ demands celibacy. Marriage is good, and apostles may embrace it without apology, just as Peter reminds husbands to honor their wives (<a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As do the other apostles</b><p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s appeal to &#8220;the other apostles&#8221; shows his practice was not abnormal; it was the norm.<p>&#8226; We see apostles ministering with family or close kin: e.g., &#8220;When Jesus came into Peter&#8217;s house, He saw Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law sick with fever&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-14.htm">Matthew 8:14</a>), revealing Peter&#8217;s marriage and household life.<p>&#8226; Apostolic example sets a precedent: workers deserve support not only for themselves but also for dependents (cf. <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the Lord&#8217;s brothers</b><p>&#8226; James, Jude, and the rest of Jesus&#8217; brothers became key leaders (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>). Their marriages were apparently recognized and supported during itinerant ministry.<p>&#8226; By naming them, Paul reminds the church that even those physically related to Christ did not claim super-spiritual status through celibacy; they lived ordinary family lives while serving in extraordinary callings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Cephas</b><p>&#8226; Cephas (Peter) is singled out because Corinthian believers held him in high regard (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>). If he traveled with his wife, how could anyone deny the same privilege to Paul and Barnabas?<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s marriage is confirmed in the Gospels (<a href="/mark/1-30.htm">Mark 1:30</a>), and Church history indicates his wife accompanied him in ministry.<p>&#8226; By invoking Peter, Paul leverages a respected example to reinforce his argument: consistent practice across trusted leaders confirms the principle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s simple question exposes an inconsistency in the Corinthians&#8217; thinking. If other recognized apostles&#8212;Peter, the Lord&#8217;s brothers, and the wider missionary band&#8212;received support for their families on mission trips, then Paul and his co-workers possessed the same God-given right. The verse teaches that marriage is honorable, family needs matter, and churches should willingly provide for those who labor in the gospel, freeing them to serve without distraction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">To lead about a sister, a wife</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to take with us on our journeys a Christian woman as a wife. Roman divines have interpreted this as referring to "the custom of Christian matrons attending as sisters upon the Apostles." But as the Apostle illustrates his meaning by a reference to Peter, who we know had a wife, such an interpretation is inadmissible. St. Paul, in this verse, carries his statement of apostolic right to support one step further. Not only had he a right to be supported himself, but the support of the married Apostles and their wives by the Church implied the same right on the part of all. A practice which grew out of a misapprehension of the real meaning of this passage, led to grave scandal, and was finally condemned by the first Council of Nicaea (A.D. 325).<span class= "bld"><p>The brethren of the Lord, and Cephas.</span>--These are mentioned specially, not as distinct from the Apostles (for Cephas, of course, was one), but as examples which would have great weight with the particular Jewish faction to whom this argument was adduced. James was Bishop of Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/15-13.htm" title="And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brothers, listen to me:">Acts 15:13</a>; <a href="/acts/21-18.htm" title="And the day following Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.">Acts 21:18</a>). The other brethren of our Lord were Joses, Simon, and Judas (<a href="/matthew/13-55.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?">Matthew 13:55</a>). They were not of the twelve Apostles, even after their conversion being mentioned as distinct from the Twelve (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm" title="These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.">Acts 1:14</a>), although James subsequently occupied an apostolic position (<a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>). Various and ingenious suggestions have been made as to who these "brethren of the Lord" were; amongst others, that they were cousins, or that they were children of Joseph by a former marriage. These views grew out of a desire to establish the perpetual virginity of Mary. The natural conclusion from a study of the mention of their names in the Gospels, without preconceived prejudice, would be that Joseph and Mary lived together after the miraculous birth of Christ, and that these were their children. This, too, is supported by the use of the word <span class= "ital">"first-born"</span> in reference to our Lord (<a href="/matthew/1-25.htm" title="And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.">Matthew 1:25</a>; <a href="/luke/2-7.htm" title="And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.">Luke 2:7</a>), and the word "till" (<a href="/matthew/1-25.htm" title="And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.">Matthew 1:25</a>), and "before they came together" (<a href="/matthew/1-18.htm" title="Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.">Matthew 1:18</a>), and the repeated mention of them as brethren in connection with His mother Mary. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/12-46.htm" title="While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him.">Matthew 12:46</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To lead about a sister, a wife.</span> There can be no doubt that this represents the true reading, and that the meaning is, "We have power to lead about, that is, to travel in company with, some Christian sister to whom we are married, and who is supported at the expense of the Church." This plain meaning, however, involving the assertion that the apostles and desposyni ("the Lord's brethren") were married men, was so distasteful to the morbid asceticism which held celibacy in a sort of Manichaean reverence, that the scribes of the fourth, fifth, and later centuries freely tampered with the text, in the happily fruitless attempt to get rid of this meaning. They endeavoured, by putting the word in the plural or by omitting "wife," to suggest that the women whom the apostles travelled with were "deaconesses." Augustine, Tertullian, Ambrose, and others explain the verse of "ministering women" (<a href="/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2, 3</a>). The false interpretation avenged itself on the bias which led to it. Valla adopts the wilful invention that the apostles, though married, travelled with their wives only as sisters. Such subterfuges have eaten away the heart of honest exegesis from many passages of Scripture, and originated the taunt that it is a "nose of wax," which readers can twist as they like. It was the cause of such shameful abuses and misrepresentations that at last the practice of travelling about with unmarried women, who went under the name of "sisters," "beloved," "companions," was distinctly forbidden by the third canon of the first Council of Nice. Simon Magus might unblushingly carry about with him a Tyrian woman named Helena; but apostles and true Christians would never have been guilty of any conduct which could give a handle to base suspicions. They travelled only with their wives. <span class="accented">A</span> <span class="accented">sister.</span> A Christian woman (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>; <a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15</a>, etc.). <span class="accented">A wife</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a wife. <span class="cmt_word">Other apostles.</span> This is a positive mistranslation for "<span class="accented">the rest of the</span> apostles." It might be too much to infer positively from this that <span class="accented">every one</span> of the apostles and desposyni were married; but there is independent evidence and tradition to show that at any rate most of them were. <span class="cmt_word">The brethren of the Lord.</span> They are clearly and undeniably <span class="accented">distinguished from</span> the apostles. According to the Helvidian theory (to which the plain language of the Gospels seems to point), they were sons of Joseph and Mary. This is the view of St. Clement of Alexandria in ancient times, and writers so different from each other as De Wette, Neander, Osiander, Meyer, Ewald, and Alford, in modern. The theory of Jerome, that they were cousins of Jesus, being sons of Alphseus and Mary, a sister of the Virgin, is on every ground absolutely untenable, and it was half dropped even by St. Jerome himself, when it had served his controversial purpose. The theory of Epiphanius, that they were sons of Joseph by a previous marriage, is possible, but incapable of proof. It comes from a tainted source - the apocryphal Gospels (see my 'Early Days of Christianity,' 2). <span class="cmt_word">Cephas</span>. St. Paul also uses the Aramaic name in <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>.
