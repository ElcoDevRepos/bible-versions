Throughout history, humanity has faced similar trials, as seen in the temptations of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3) and the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 16-17). The Greek word for "temptation" can also mean "testing," suggesting that these experiences are part of the human condition. This aligns with the biblical narrative that all have sinned (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>) and that temptation is a common experience for all people.<p><b>And God is faithful;</b><br>The faithfulness of God is a central theme throughout Scripture, underscoring His unchanging nature and reliability. In the Old Testament, God's faithfulness is demonstrated in His covenant with Abraham (Genesis 15) and His steadfast love for Israel despite their rebellion (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). In the New Testament, this faithfulness is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's promises (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>). This assurance of God's faithfulness provides believers with confidence that He will support them through trials.<p><b>He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.</b><br>This promise assures believers that God, in His sovereignty, sets limits on the trials they face. The idea is that God knows each person's capacity and will not allow them to be overwhelmed. This is reminiscent of Job's story, where God permitted Satan to test Job but set boundaries on the extent of his suffering (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12, 2</a>:6). It reflects the belief that God is in control and that His grace is sufficient for any challenge (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><b>But when you are tempted,</b><br>The inevitability of temptation is acknowledged here, suggesting that it is not a matter of if but when. This aligns with Jesus' teachings, where He instructs His disciples to pray for deliverance from temptation (<a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>). The presence of temptation is a reality in the Christian life, but it is also an opportunity for spiritual growth and reliance on God.<p><b>He will also provide an escape,</b><br>God's provision of an escape route highlights His active involvement in the believer's life. This escape is not necessarily the removal of the temptation but the ability to endure it without succumbing. The concept of escape can be seen in the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt (Exodus 14) and the protection of Daniel in the lion's den (Daniel 6). It underscores the idea that God provides a way out, often through His Word, prayer, and the support of the Christian community.<p><b>so that you can stand up under it.</b><br>The purpose of the escape is not merely to avoid temptation but to endure it and emerge stronger. This endurance is a recurring theme in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to persevere in faith (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, <a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3-5</a>). The imagery of standing up under temptation suggests resilience and victory, echoing the triumph of Christ over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>). It encourages believers to rely on God's strength and promises to overcome challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance and encouragement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece known for its diverse culture and moral challenges, where the early Christian church faced various temptations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, struggling with issues of idolatry, immorality, and division.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The faithful provider of strength and escape in times of temptation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/temptation.htm">Temptation</a></b><br>The trials and challenges common to all humans, which the Corinthian believers were experiencing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_temptation.htm">Understanding Temptation</a></b><br>Recognize that temptation is a common experience for all believers.

When the pressure hits, we are not singled out. <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a> reminds us that even our Lord &#8220;has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet was without sin,&#8221; underscoring that shared experience.<p>&#8226; Knowing temptation is &#8220;common&#8221; exposes one of the enemy&#8217;s favorite lies&#8212;that our struggle is unique and therefore hopeless. First Peter 5:9 urges us to &#8220;stand firm, knowing that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Because temptation is part of the human condition (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2&#8211;3</a>), we can face it with humility rather than surprise, and with solidarity rather than isolation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And God is faithful</b><p>&#8226; The safety net in every trial is not our resolve but God&#8217;s character. <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a> rejoices that &#8220;His compassions never fail; they are new every morning.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Faithful&#8221; means He always keeps covenant (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). Second Timothy 2:13 says that even &#8220;if we are faithless, He remains faithful.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This faithfulness guarantees that the next two promises are trustworthy&#8212;He limits temptation and provides escape.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear</b><p>&#8226; God stands as a sovereign gatekeeper. Like He did with Job (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>), He sets the boundary lines on every test.<p>&#8226; The phrase does not teach sinless perfection; it teaches sufficient grace. <a href="/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a> comforts us that &#8220;He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s Prayer models dependence on this promise: &#8220;Lead us not into temptation&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>). We pray it because He truly governs what reaches us.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: when a temptation feels overwhelming, the feeling is lying to you. God&#8217;s Word, which cannot lie (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>), says it is not greater than the grace allotted to you.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But when you are tempted, He will also provide an escape, so that you can stand up under it</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Escape&#8221; is not always a dramatic exit; it may be the strength to endure. <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a> depicts God&#8217;s people passing through fire without being consumed.<p>&#8226; Common avenues of escape:<p>&#8211; Fleeing the scene (<a href="/genesis/39-12.htm">Genesis 39:12</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>)<p>&#8211; Resisting by submitting to God (<a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>)<p>&#8211; Replacing lies with truth stored in the heart (<a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>)<p>&#8211; Walking by the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>)<p>&#8211; Putting on the full armor of God (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-17</a>)<p>&#8211; Staying alert in prayer (<a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>)<p>&#8226; The goal is not mere survival but victory&#8212;&#8220;so that you can stand up under it.&#8221; Standing means we emerge with faith intact and testimony strengthened (<a href="/2_peter/2-9.htm">2 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Temptation is universal, but so is God&#8217;s faithfulness. He personally limits every test and builds in an escape route, enabling us to remain standing. Trust His character, use His provided means of escape, and walk in the assurance that no temptation can overpower the grace He supplies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">There hath no temptation taken you.</span>--What is meant by a "temptation common to man" (or rather, <span class= "ital">suited to man</span>) is explained further on as a temptation which one is "able to bear." From the warning and exhortation of the previous verse the Apostle passes on to words of encouragement, "You need not be hopeless or despairing." God permits the temptation by allowing the circumstances which create temptation to arise, but He takes care that no Fate bars the path of retreat. With each temptation he makes a way to escape from it. And that is so, must be so, because God is faithful. The state of salvation to which God has called us would be a delusion if there were an insuperable difficulty to our continuing in it. We have in this verse, perhaps, the most practical and therefore the clearest exposition to be found of the doctrine of free-will in relation to God's overruling power. God makes an open road, but then man himself must <span class= "ital">walk</span> in it. God controls circumstances, but man uses them. That is where <span class= "ital">his</span> responsibility lies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But such as is common to man;</span> rather, <span class="accented">except such as is human</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> such as man can bear. The last verse was a warning; this is an encouragement. Having just heard what efforts even St. Paul had to make to run in the Christian race, and how terribly their fathers in the wilderness had failed to meet the requirements of God, they might be inclined to throw up every effort in despair. St. Paul, therefore, reminds them that these temptations were not superhuman, but were such as men <span class="accented">had</span> resisted, and such as <span class="accented">they</span> could resist. God is faithful He had called them (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>), and since he knew "how to deliver the godly out of temptations" (<a href="/2_peter/2-9.htm">2 Peter 2:9</a>), he would surely perform his side of the covenant, and, if they did their parts, would stablish and keep them from evil (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>). Also. The mode of deliverance shall be ready simultaneously with the temptation. Away to escape; rather, <span class="accented">the way to escape.</span> The way to escape is different in different temptations, but for each temptation God would provide the <span class="accented">special</span> means of escaping it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(ouk)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
