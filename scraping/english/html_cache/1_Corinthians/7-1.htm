The Corinthian church was dealing with various issues, and they sought Paul's guidance. This reflects the early church's practice of seeking apostolic authority for doctrinal and practical matters. The phrase suggests a dialogical relationship between Paul and the church, emphasizing the importance of addressing real-life issues within the Christian community.<p><b>It is good to abstain from sexual relations.</b><br>Paul's statement here must be understood within the cultural and historical context of Corinth, a city known for its sexual immorality and pagan practices. The phrase "it is good" suggests a commendable or beneficial choice, not a command. Paul acknowledges the value of celibacy, especially in light of the "present distress" (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>), which may refer to persecution or other challenges facing the church. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/19-12.htm">Matthew 19:12</a> about those who choose celibacy for the sake of the kingdom. However, Paul later clarifies that marriage is also honorable and that each person has their own gift from God (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7</a>).

Paul begins by affirming that celibacy is indeed &#8220;good,&#8221; but the verses that follow clarify that it is not mandated for everyone.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Good&#8221; points to moral value, not a universal command; celibacy can foster undistracted devotion to the Lord (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-32.htm">1 Corinthians 7:32-35</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-11.htm">Matthew 19:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Marriage is also declared good in Scripture (<a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>).

The guiding principle is wholehearted devotion to the Lord, expressed through purity in singleness or faithfulness in marriage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-40.</span> - <span class="accented">Answers to the inquiries of the Corinthians respecting marriage.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">lawfulness of marriage, and its duties.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now concerning.</span> This refers to questions of the Corinthians (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-25.htm">1 Corinthians 7:25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>). It is <span class="cmt_word">good for a man not to touch a woman.</span> The word used is not <span class="accented">agathon</span>, good, but <span class="accented">kalon</span>, fair; "an excellent thing." In ver. 26 he limits the word by the clause, "good <span class="accented">for the present necessity."</span> There is no limitation here, and it is probable that St. Paul is quoting the actual words of the letter which he had received from Corinth. There had sprung up among them some antinomians, who, perhaps by perverting his own teaching or that of Apollos, had made liberty a cloak of lasciviousness. In indignant reaction against such laxity, others, perhaps, with Essene proclivities, had been led to disparage matrimony as involving an inevitable stain. Gnosticism, and the spirit which led to it, oscillated between the two extremes of asceticism and uncleanness. Both extremes were grounded on the assertion that matter is inherently evil. Ascetic Gnostics, therefore, strove to destroy by severity every carnal impulse; antinomian Gnostics argued that the life of the spirit was so utterly independent of the flesh that what the flesh did was of no consequence. We find the <span class="accented">germs</span> of Gnostic heresy long before the name appeared. Theoretically, St. Paul inclines to the ascetic view, not in the abstract, but in view of the near advent of Christ, and of the cares, distractions, and even trials which marriage involved in days of struggle and persecution. Yet his wisdom is shown in the cautious moderation with which he expresses himself. The tone of the letter written by Gregory the Great to Augustine with reference to similar inquiries about Saxon converts is very different. The example of St. Paul should have shown the mediaeval moralists and even the later Fathers how wrong it is "to give themselves airs of certainty on points where certainty is not to be had." <span class="accented">Not to touch a woman.</span> St. Paul means generally "not to marry" (comp. <a href="/genesis/20-4.htm">Genesis 20:4</a> [LXX.]). Celibacy under the then existing conditions of the Christian world is, he admits, in itself an honourable and morally salutary thing, though, for the majority, marriage may be a positive duty. He is not dreaming of the <span class="accented">nominal</span> marriages of mediaeval ascetics, for he assumes and directs that all who marry should live in conjugal union. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/7-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Peri)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4012.htm">Strong's 4012: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of peran; properly, through, i.e. Around; figuratively with respect to; used in various applications, of place, cause or time.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the matters</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8039;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Genitive Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you wrote about:</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#968;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(egrapsate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1125.htm">Strong's 1125: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; to 'grave', especially to write; figuratively, to describe.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[It is] good</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#955;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(kalon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2570.htm">Strong's 2570: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, beautiful, but chiefly good, i.e. Valuable or virtuous.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to abstain from sexual relations.</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7941;&#960;&#964;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(haptesthai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Infinitive Middle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_680.htm">Strong's 680: </a> </span><span class="str2">Prop: I fasten to; I lay hold of, touch, know carnally.
