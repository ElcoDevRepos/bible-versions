These historical events serve as moral and spiritual lessons for believers. The Apostle Paul uses the failures of the Israelites to warn the Corinthian church against similar pitfalls. The concept of using past events as examples is a common biblical theme, emphasizing the importance of learning from history to avoid repeating mistakes. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that God&#8217;s dealings with Israel serve as a pattern for His dealings with the church.<p><b>to keep us from craving evil things</b><br>The phrase highlights the human tendency to desire what is contrary to God&#8217;s will. In the context of the Israelites, this refers to their longing for the comforts of Egypt and their subsequent idolatry and immorality. The term "craving" suggests a strong, uncontrolled desire, which in biblical terms often leads to sin. This warning is relevant to the Corinthian church, which faced temptations related to idolatry and immorality in their own culture. The admonition is timeless, reminding believers to guard their hearts against desires that lead away from God.<p><b>as they did</b><br>This refers specifically to the Israelites during their wilderness journey. Their craving for evil things led to various acts of disobedience, such as the worship of the golden calf (Exodus 32) and the rebellion at Kadesh Barnea (Numbers 14). These acts resulted in severe consequences, including God&#8217;s judgment and the death of many. The phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of yielding to sinful desires. It underscores the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God, drawing a parallel between the experiences of the Israelites and the potential pitfalls facing the Corinthian believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites_in_the_wilderness.htm">The Israelites in the Wilderness</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a> refers to the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt and their subsequent wanderings in the wilderness.

All this material suffering on their part will not be in vain if it teaches us the spiritual lesson which God would have us learn from it.<p><span class= "bld">We should not lust after evil things.</span>--The Apostle now sets forth the causes with which the majority of the Israelities neutralised the great advantages in which all had shared. The lusting after evil things must be taken as applying to their general conduct (evidenced especially in the circumstances mentioned in <a href="/numbers/11-4.htm" title="And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?">Numbers 11:4</a>; <a href="/numbers/11-18.htm" title="And say you to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and you shall eat flesh: for you have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and you shall eat.">Numbers 11:18</a>). "As they also" directly connects the sins which the Corinthians were in danger of with the sins which led to the overthrow of the Israelites. The idolatry and eating and drinking and committing fornication all refer to kinds of sin which the Corinthians were liable to commit if they did not keep themselves perfectly distinct from the heathen. (See <a href="/1_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.">1Corinthians 6:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things were our examples.</span> If this rendering be adopted, perhaps "examples" is the best equivalent of the original <span class="accented">tupoi</span>, as in <a href="/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>, "Walk so as ye have us for an example (<span class="accented">tupelo</span>)<span class="accented">."</span> It may, however, mean "types," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> foreshadowing symbols, as in <a href="/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>, where Adam is the "figure" (<span class="accented">tupos</span>) of Christ.
