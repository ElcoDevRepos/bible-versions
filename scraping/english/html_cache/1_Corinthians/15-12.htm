The resurrection is a foundational doctrine in Christianity, affirming Jesus as the Son of God and validating His victory over sin and death. The preaching of Christ's resurrection was central to the apostolic message (<a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>). Historically, the resurrection was a well-attested event, with multiple eyewitness accounts (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5-8</a>). Theologically, it fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>, which speak of the Messiah's triumph over death.<p><b>how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</b><br>This phrase addresses a specific issue within the Corinthian church, where some members doubted the general resurrection of the dead. In the Greco-Roman world, many philosophical systems, such as Platonism, viewed the physical body as inferior to the spirit, leading to skepticism about bodily resurrection. Paul counters this by affirming that Christ's resurrection is the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>), indicating that believers will also be raised. This belief is consistent with Jewish eschatology, which anticipated a future resurrection (<a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>). The denial of the resurrection undermines the entire Christian faith, as Paul later argues that if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised, and faith is futile (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-13.htm">1 Corinthians 15:13-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

Yet it comes with something of a shock on our paralyzed sense of astonishment to read that some of these Christians actually denied a resurrection!
