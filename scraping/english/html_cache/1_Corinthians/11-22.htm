In the early church, the Lord's Supper was often part of a larger communal meal, known as the "love feast." Paul is reprimanding those who were treating this sacred gathering as a common meal, indulging in food and drink without regard for others. The rhetorical question implies that such behavior is inappropriate for a church setting, emphasizing the need for reverence and unity. The home is suggested as the proper place for satisfying personal hunger and thirst, not the communal gathering meant for worship and remembrance of Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing?</b><br>Here, Paul highlights the social divisions within the Corinthian church. The wealthier members were eating and drinking excessively, while the poorer members were left with nothing. This behavior not only disrespects the church as a sacred institution but also humiliates those who are less fortunate. The church is meant to be a place of equality and love, reflecting the body of Christ where all members are valued. This phrase underscores the importance of unity and care for one another, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/james/2.htm">James 2:1-9</a>, which warns against showing favoritism.<p><b>What can I say to you?</b><br>Paul's rhetorical question expresses his frustration and disappointment with the Corinthians' behavior. It indicates that their actions are indefensible and contrary to the teachings of Christ. This phrase serves as a pause for reflection, urging the Corinthians to consider the gravity of their actions and the need for repentance. It echoes the tone of a fatherly rebuke, aiming to correct and guide the church back to proper conduct.<p><b>Shall I praise you for this?</b><br>This question further emphasizes Paul's disapproval. Praise is reserved for actions that align with Christian values and the teachings of Jesus. By questioning whether he should commend them, Paul highlights the stark contrast between their behavior and what is expected of believers. This phrase serves as a call to self-examination, encouraging the Corinthians to assess their actions in light of their faith.<p><b>No, I will not!</b><br>Paul's firm response leaves no room for ambiguity. His refusal to praise the Corinthians underscores the seriousness of their misconduct. This definitive statement serves as a corrective measure, aiming to realign the church with the principles of love, unity, and respect that are central to the Christian faith. It reflects the apostolic authority Paul holds and his commitment to maintaining the integrity of the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the Corinthian church with authority and pastoral concern.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often divided congregation in the city of Corinth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_supper.htm">The Lord's Supper</a></b><br>The event being discussed, where the Corinthians were misusing the communal meal meant to commemorate Jesus' sacrifice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_in_the_church.htm">The Poor in the Church</a></b><br>Those who were being humiliated and marginalized during the communal meals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_of_god.htm">The Church of God</a></b><br>The broader community of believers, which Paul emphasizes should be respected and honored.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_the_church_community.htm">Respect for the Church Community</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes the importance of honoring the church as the body of Christ.

Paul insists that ordinary hunger be met at home, that the gathered church be revered, and that every believer&#8212;rich or poor&#8212;be honored. Anything less dishonors Christ and cannot receive apostolic praise or divine approval.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">What? have ye not houses</span> <span class= "bld">. . .?</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Surely it is not that you have no houses to eat and</span> <span class= "ital">drink in?</span> This cannot be the explanation of their conduct, for they have houses in which they can enjoy their proper meals. Hunger and thirst, which can be satisfied at home, therefore, cannot be the explanation of their conduct at the charity-feasts. The only other alternative explanation, therefore, is that they despise an assembly which is the Church of God; and they put to shame those poor members, who, no doubt, were the majority, who have not houses in which to eat and drink, and have come together in this common assembly of Christians to share in the food which the wealthier members ought to contribute.<p>The shame which a poor man will feel when the rich come to these feasts bringing supplies for their own private use, and not for general distribution, will arise both from the striking contrast which will come out all the more vividly from his poverty being brought into such direct contact with the wealth of the rich, and from the evident dislike of the rich to partake of a common meal with the poor. Thus those assemblies will, through the misconduct of the wealthier Christians, have precisely the opposite result from that which they were intended to accomplish. It will be an assembly in one place, but not to partake of one supper--even that which is dedicated to the Lord. The Apostle asks indignantly whether such conduct can be included in the catalogue (see <a href="/1_corinthians/11-17.htm" title="Now in this that I declare to you I praise you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.">1Corinthians 11:17</a>) of those things for which he can praise them, and then in the following verses shows how such conduct cannot be worthy of praise, inasmuch as it is entirely at variance with the solemn and sacred circumstances in which the Lord's Supper originated.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To eat and to drink in.</span> The object of the <span class="accented">agape</span> was something higher than the mere gratification of appetite. Though not a sacrament, it was an accompaniment of the Lord's Supper, and was itself intended to be a symbolical and sacred meal. <span class="cmt_word">Despise ye the Church of God!</span> The congregation of your fellow Christians.

But the commentators found it difficult to suppose that any of the Corinthians had not "houses to eat and to drink in." Hence most commentators give to the phrase its classic sense, in which "those who have" means the rich, and "those who have not," the poor. They seem, however, to have forgotten that slaves at any rate could hardly be said to have "houses of their own," and it is certain that not a few of the Corinthian Christians were slaves. <span class="cmt_word">I praise you not.</span> As in ver. 17, this is an instance of what is called <span class="accented">litotes</span>, a mild expression, suggesting a meaning much stronger than the words themselves. <span class="cmt_word">For</span>.
