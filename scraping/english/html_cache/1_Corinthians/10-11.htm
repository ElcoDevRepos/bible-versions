These events serve as moral and spiritual lessons for believers. The Israelites' journey, including their disobedience and God's subsequent judgments, are meant to instruct and caution the church. The Apostle Paul uses these historical accounts to illustrate the consequences of idolatry, immorality, and unbelief. The concept of using past events as examples is consistent with the biblical principle that history is a teacher, as seen in <a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>, where it is stated that everything written in the past was written to teach us.<p><b>and were written down as warnings for us</b><br>The documentation of these events in Scripture serves a dual purpose: to preserve the historical record and to provide a moral and spiritual warning to future generations. The warnings are intended to prevent believers from repeating the same mistakes. This reflects the broader biblical theme of Scripture being divinely inspired and useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). The written word acts as a safeguard, reminding believers of the consequences of straying from God's commandments.<p><b>on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come</b><br>This phrase indicates that the recipients of Paul's letter, and by extension all believers, are living in a significant era in salvation history. The "fulfillment of the ages" refers to the culmination of God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ. With Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension, the promises and prophecies of the Old Testament find their fulfillment. This eschatological perspective emphasizes the urgency and responsibility of living faithfully in light of the completed work of Christ. The phrase echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>, where it is stated that God has spoken to us by His Son in these last days, highlighting the significance of the current age in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites_in_the_wilderness.htm">Israelites in the Wilderness</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/bsb/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10</a> refers to the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt and their subsequent wanderings in the wilderness.

The apostle has just rehearsed Israel&#8217;s wilderness failures&#8212;idolatry, immorality, testing God, and grumbling (10:6&#8211;10).<p>&#8226; These are not myths or parables; they are real events recorded in Exodus and Numbers.<p>&#8226; Each incident displays a principle: sin always invites God&#8217;s discipline (<a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22-23</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul already said, &#8220;These things took place as examples to keep us from craving evil things as they did&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>), echoing <a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>: &#8220;Everything that was written in the past was written for our instruction.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By calling them &#8220;examples,&#8221; God graciously provides living case studies so we don&#8217;t have to learn the hard way.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and were written down as warnings for us</b><p>The Spirit ensured that the record was preserved &#8220;as warnings for us.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture serves as a written safeguard, steering believers away from judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-19.htm">Deuteronomy 31:19-21</a>; <a href="/psalms/102-18.htm">Psalm 102:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The permanence of the text means the warning remains accessible to each new generation (<a href="/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>; <a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s use of &#8220;us&#8221; shows the church is directly addressed; we cannot relegate Israel&#8217;s story to another era (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the warning is written, we can read it, teach it, and measure our lives against it, just as James urges believers to look into &#8220;the perfect law that gives freedom&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come</b><p>We live in the climactic stage of God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s first coming inaugurated &#8220;the fullness of time&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>); His cross and resurrection launched the last days (<a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today stand at the convergence of all prior revelation&#8212;what earlier generations awaited, we now experience (<a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; This privilege intensifies responsibility: &#8220;From everyone who has been given much, much will be required&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p>&#8226; The nearness of the consummation (&#8220;the end of all things is near,&#8221; <a href="/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>) urges vigilant holiness (<a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Israel&#8217;s history is God&#8217;s intentional tutorial. Real events became living illustrations so we would learn without repeating their sins. The written Word locks those lessons in place, warning every believer. And because we stand at the hinge of history, when all God&#8217;s promises reach their climax in Christ, those warnings carry greater weight than ever. The verse calls us to heed Scripture&#8217;s examples, embrace its authority, and walk faithfully in this decisive hour.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Happened unto them for ensamples.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">happened unto them typically; and it was written for our admonition.</span> The verb "happened" is plural, referring to the multiplied occurrences which the Apostle has just mentioned; but "written" is singular, referring to the sacred record in which the historical facts are handed down. The Apostle does not state that the purpose which God had in view in allowing these sins and judgments was that they might serve "for ensamples" for after-generations, as may at first sight seem to be the meaning of the English, but the real point of the passage is--These things which occurred to them are to be looked upon by us, not merely as interesting historical events, but as having a typical significance. Their record remains as a standing warning that great privileges may be enjoyed by many, and used by them to their destruction.
