This reflects the early Christian understanding of the church as a family, transcending social and ethnic boundaries. Paul often uses this term to address the members of the church, highlighting their shared faith and common identity in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>I could not address you as spiritual</b><br>Paul contrasts the spiritual maturity he desires with the current state of the Corinthian believers. The term "spiritual" refers to those who are led by the Holy Spirit and exhibit the fruits of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). The Corinthian church, known for its divisions and moral issues, struggled to live according to the Spirit, as evidenced by their behavior and attitudes (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10-13</a>).<p><b>but as worldly</b><br>"Worldly" or "carnal" describes those who are influenced by the desires and values of the world rather than the Spirit. This reflects the tension between living according to the flesh and living according to the Spirit, a theme Paul explores in <a href="/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5-8</a>. The Corinthian church's issues, such as factionalism and immorality, demonstrate their worldly mindset.<p><b>as infants in Christ</b><br>Paul uses the metaphor of infancy to describe the Corinthians' spiritual immaturity. While they are "in Christ," indicating their salvation and position as believers, they have not grown in their faith. This imagery of spiritual growth is common in Paul's writings, where he encourages believers to mature in their understanding and practice of the faith (<a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14-15</a>). The concept of being "in Christ" is central to Paul's theology, signifying a believer's union with Jesus and participation in His life, death, and resurrection (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians.

By choosing this address, Paul:<p>&#8226; Signals affection and unity, even while preparing to correct.<p>&#8226; Reminds the Corinthians that their primary identity is in God&#8217;s family, not in competing factions (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Echoes Jesus&#8217; words that spiritual relationships outweigh earthly ties (<a href="/mark/3-34.htm">Mark 3:34&#8211;35</a>).<p>Though about to confront, Paul&#8217;s tone is relational, binding shepherd and flock together under one Lord (<a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I could not address you as spiritual,</b><p>The apostle literally states he &#8220;could not&#8221;&#8212;his hands were tied by their condition. &#8220;Spiritual&#8221; in Scripture describes those led by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-25.htm">Galatians 5:25</a>) and able to &#8220;discern all things&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-15.htm">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>). Because the Corinthians were not living in that yielded state:<p>&#8226; They missed deeper teaching much like Jesus&#8217; disciples before Pentecost (<a href="/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Their thinking resembled the &#8220;natural man&#8221; who &#8220;does not accept the things of the Spirit of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s message had to stay elementary, mirroring <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>: &#8220;You need someone to teach you the basic principles of God&#8217;s word all over again.&#8221;<p>Their lack of spiritual responsiveness made richer truths inappropriate for the moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but as worldly,</b><p>&#8220;Worldly&#8221; (or &#8220;fleshly&#8221;) flags behavior driven by old desires rather than by the Spirit (<a href="/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5</a>). Evidence of that mindset in Corinth included jealousy and quarreling over favorite teachers (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3&#8211;4</a>).

He longs for them&#8212;and us&#8212;to shed fleshly ways, embrace the Spirit&#8217;s leading, and advance from milk to solid food so the church reflects heaven, not the world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>III.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">And I.</span>--Again, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1Corinthians 2:6</a>, the Apostle shows how general principles which he has just explained were exemplified in his own conduct. In the closing verses of 1 Corinthians 2 St. Paul has enunciated the general method of teaching spiritual truth as being dependent upon the receptive powers of those who are being taught. He now proceeds to point out to them that their own character, as being wanting in spirituality, was the real hindrance to his teaching them the higher spiritual truth which may be called "the wisdom" of the gospel.<p><span class= "bld">As unto carnal.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">as being carnal.</span> Our version may seem to imply that the Apostle spoke to them <span class= "ital">as if</span> they were carnal, though they really were not so; but the force of the passage is that they were indeed carnal, and that the Apostle taught them not as if they were such, but as being such. "Carnal" is here the opposite of "spiritual," and does not involve any reference to what we would commonly speak of as carnal sin.<p><span class= "bld">Babes in Christ.</span>--This is the opposite of the "full grown" in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1Corinthians 2:6</a>, to whom the "wisdom" could be taught. (See also <a href="/colossians/1-28.htm" title=" Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:">Colossians 1:28</a>, "full grown in Christ.") It may be an interesting indication of the "manliness" of St. Paul's character and his high estimate of it in others, that he constantly uses the words "babe" and "childhood" in a depreciatory sense. (See <a href="/romans/2-20.htm" title="An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which have the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.">Romans 2:20</a>, <a href="/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>, <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm" title="That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;">Ephesians 4:14</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - <span class="accented">The carnal conceit of the spiritually immature.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I... could not speak unto you as unto spiritual.</span> Though softened by the word brethren, there was a crushing irony of reproof in these words: "You thought yourselves quite above the need of my simple teaching.
