In the early church, prophets played a crucial role in guiding and edifying the community (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>). The Old Testament prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, were seen as forerunners to this gift, speaking God's word to His people. Prophecy is not just about foretelling the future but also about forth-telling, or proclaiming God's message. In <a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>, prophecy is listed among the spiritual gifts, highlighting its importance in the church.<p><b>and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge</b><br>Mysteries in the biblical context often refer to divine truths that were once hidden but are now revealed through Christ (<a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>). Knowledge, in this sense, is not merely intellectual but spiritual understanding granted by the Holy Spirit. The ability to comprehend all mysteries and knowledge suggests a deep insight into God's plans and purposes, akin to the wisdom given to Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>). However, Paul emphasizes that even such profound understanding is insufficient without love.<p><b>and if I have absolute faith so as to move mountains</b><br>This phrase echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>, where faith as small as a mustard seed can move mountains. It signifies a faith that is unwavering and capable of achieving the impossible. In biblical times, mountains were often seen as obstacles or challenges, and the ability to move them symbolizes overcoming great difficulties through faith. This kind of faith is a powerful testament to one's trust in God's power and sovereignty.<p><b>but have not love</b><br>Love is the central theme of <a href="/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, often referred to as the "Love Chapter." In the biblical context, love (agape) is selfless, sacrificial, and unconditional, reflecting the nature of God Himself (1 <a href="/john/4-8.htm">John 4:8</a>). Paul underscores that love is the greatest of all virtues, surpassing even faith and hope (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>). Without love, spiritual gifts and achievements are meaningless, as love is the essence of Christian life and the fulfillment of the law (<a href="/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>).<p><b>I am nothing</b><br>This stark conclusion emphasizes the futility of spiritual gifts and accomplishments without love. In the eyes of God, love is the measure of true worth and significance. The absence of love renders even the most extraordinary spiritual feats void and empty. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, where He states that apart from Him, believers can do nothing. Love is the defining characteristic of a true disciple of Christ (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostle_paul.htm">Apostle Paul</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul was addressing the church in Corinth, a city known for its diversity and moral challenges.

Prophecy&#8212;whether foretelling future events or forth-telling God&#8217;s present word&#8212;comes straight from the Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>; <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture celebrates prophetic ministry (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>). Yet Paul immediately hints that even this powerful, Spirit-given ability can fall short. The implication is unmistakable: extraordinary gifting never substitutes for Christ-like character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge</b><p>&#8226; Paul piles on the superlatives: complete understanding of &#8220;mysteries&#8221; (divine secrets) and &#8220;all knowledge.&#8221; Think of Daniel interpreting dreams (<a href="/daniel/2-22.htm">Daniel 2:22</a>) or the apostles unpacking the gospel&#8217;s hidden plan (<a href="/ephesians/3-4.htm">Ephesians 3:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a> exclaims, &#8220;Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!&#8221; Yet even if someone could map that depth perfectly, it would still be hollow without love. Head knowledge that never reaches the heart profits no one (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and if I have absolute faith so as to move mountains</b><p>&#8226; Jesus said, &#8220;If you have faith the size of a mustard seed&#8230; nothing will be impossible for you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>).

Even that heroic trust, Paul says, still needs love as its engine and aim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but have not love</b><p>&#8226; Here&#8217;s the pivot. Biblical love (agap&#275;) is self-giving, covenantal devotion that mirrors God&#8217;s own heart (<a href="/1_john/4-7.htm">1 John 4:7-8</a>). Jesus made it the family badge: &#8220;By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/3-14.htm">Colossians 3:14</a> calls love &#8220;the bond of perfect unity.&#8221; Without it, the brightest gifts and greatest feats turn into noise (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>) and smoke (<a href="/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am nothing</b><p>&#8226; Paul doesn&#8217;t say, &#8220;I do nothing&#8221; or &#8220;I have less.&#8221; He says, &#8220;I am nothing.&#8221; Identity, not merely activity, is at stake. Spiritual prestige minus love equals spiritual zero.<p>&#8226; Jesus warned of impressive ministries that still hear, &#8220;I never knew you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22-23</a>). Paul echoes that seriousness: without love, even mountain-moving faith leaves us bankrupt (<a href="/philippians/3-7.htm">Philippians 3:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a> stacks the most dazzling spiritual credentials imaginable&#8212;perfect prophecy, exhaustive knowledge, miracle-working faith&#8212;and declares them worthless without love. The verse insists that love is not an accessory to Christian life; it is the essence. Gifts display God&#8217;s power, but love displays God&#8217;s nature. When love drives our gifts, both the giver and the church flourish. When love is missing, all that remains is empty noise and a life that, in God&#8217;s economy, &#8220;is nothing.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Prophecy.</span>--The Apostle valued the gift of prophecy--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> preaching--more highly than the gift of tongues, which stood first in Corinthian estimation. He therefore naturally selects it as coming into the same condemnation, if unaccompanied by love. All the secrets of God's providence and complete knowledge (see <a href="/1_corinthians/12-8.htm" title="For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;">1Corinthians 12:8</a>), even such a transcendent faith as Christ had spoken of as capable of moving mountains (<a href="/matthew/17-20.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.">Matthew 17:20</a>), may belong to a man, and without love he is nothing. We must not take these words as implying that the Apostle possessed this vast knowledge and faith personally. The whole argument is put hypothetically--it supposes a man possessed of these qualities.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prophecy</span>. The power of lofty utterance belonged to Balaam and Caiaphas; yet it availed them nothing without love.

It is, however, much more probable that, if St. Paul derived the words from our Lord, they came to him by oral tradition. And the inference must in any case be precarious, for the phrase was so common among the rabbis that "remover of mountains" was one of their admiring titles for a great teacher<span class="cmt_word">.
