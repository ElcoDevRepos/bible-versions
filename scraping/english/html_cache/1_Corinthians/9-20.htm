As a former Pharisee, he was well-versed in Jewish law and culture (<a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>). His strategy was to identify with the Jews to effectively communicate the gospel. This reflects Jesus' own ministry, where He engaged with Jewish customs and festivals (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13-25</a>). Paul's adaptability is a practical application of <a href="/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30</a>, which speaks of winning souls. His actions were not about compromising the gospel but about removing barriers to its acceptance.<p><b>To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law),</b><br>Paul distinguishes between his identity in Christ and his strategic approach to ministry. Although he was no longer bound by the Mosaic Law due to the new covenant (<a href="/galatians/3-23.htm">Galatians 3:23-25</a>), he willingly adhered to certain aspects of it to reach those who still lived under its constraints. This reflects the principle of Christian liberty found in <a href="/romans/14.htm">Romans 14:1-23</a>, where believers are encouraged to be sensitive to the consciences of others. Paul's actions demonstrate the fulfillment of the law through love (<a href="/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>).<p><b>to win those under the law.</b><br>Paul's ultimate goal was the salvation of others, aligning with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). His willingness to adapt his behavior for the sake of the gospel exemplifies the sacrificial love of Christ, who became a servant to all (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). This phrase underscores the missional aspect of Paul's ministry, emphasizing the importance of contextualizing the gospel message without altering its core truths.

Those spoken of as "Jews" are, of course, Jews by birth and religion; those "under the Law" are probably proselytes to Judaism. In neither case do they mean Christian converts, for the object of St. Paul's conduct towards those of whom he here speaks was to win them to the Faith of Christ. He himself was no longer "under the Law" being a Christian (<a href="/galatians/2-19.htm" title="For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.">Galatians 2:19</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Jews I became as a Jew.</span> When, for instance, he circumcised Timothy (<a href="/acts/12-3.htm">Acts 12:3</a>) and probably Titus also (<a href="/galatians/2-3.htm">Galatians 2:3</a>; see 'Life of St Paul,' 1. 412, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>); and he was continuing this principle of action when he took the vow of the Nazarite (<a href="/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21-26</a>), and called himself "a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees" (<a href="/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To them that are under the Law.</span> That is, not only to Jews, but even to the most rigorous legalists among the Jews. It should be carefully observed that St. Paul is here describing the innocent concessions and compliances which arise from the harmless and generous condescension of a loving spirit. He never sank into the fear of man, which made Peter at Antioch unfaithful to his real principles. He did not allow men to form from his conduct any mistaken inference as to his essential views.
