This term underscores the unity and equality among believers, regardless of their spiritual gifts or roles within the church. It reflects the early Christian understanding of the church as a family, a concept rooted in Jesus' teachings (<a href="/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>).<p><b>if I come to you speaking in tongues,</b><br>The practice of speaking in tongues, or glossolalia, was a prominent spiritual gift in the early church, particularly in Corinth. It involved speaking in a language unknown to the speaker, often seen as a sign of the Holy Spirit's presence. However, Paul emphasizes the need for intelligibility and edification in corporate worship. This reflects the broader biblical principle that spiritual gifts are given for the common good (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>).<p><b>how will I benefit you,</b><br>Paul questions the practical benefit of speaking in tongues without interpretation. The focus is on edification and the building up of the church. This aligns with the biblical teaching that spiritual gifts should serve others and promote growth in the body of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-12</a>).<p><b>unless I bring you some revelation</b><br>Revelation refers to divine truths disclosed by God, often through prophecy or inspired teaching. In the early church, revelation was crucial for understanding God's will and purposes. This highlights the importance of conveying clear and understandable messages that reveal God's character and plans (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p><b>or knowledge</b><br>Knowledge in this context likely refers to spiritual insight or understanding of divine mysteries. Paul values knowledge that leads to spiritual maturity and deeper comprehension of the faith (<a href="/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9-10</a>). This contrasts with the Corinthian tendency to prize knowledge for its own sake (<a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>).<p><b>or prophecy</b><br>Prophecy involves speaking forth God's message, often with an element of foretelling or exhortation. In the New Testament, prophecy is highly valued for its role in edifying, encouraging, and comforting the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>). It serves as a means of direct communication from God to His people.<p><b>or teaching?</b><br>Teaching is the systematic explanation and application of Scripture. It is foundational for discipleship and spiritual growth, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). Paul emphasizes teaching as a means of conveying sound doctrine and equipping believers for every good work (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.
