Adam is often seen as a representative of humanity, and his actions had consequences for all his descendants. <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a> supports this by stating that sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin. Theologically, this establishes the concept of original sin, which affects all of humanity. The historical context of this belief is rooted in Jewish understanding of the creation and fall narratives, which were foundational to early Christian teachings.<p><b>the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the role of Jesus Christ as the "second Adam" or the "last Adam," as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>. Just as death came through Adam, resurrection and eternal life come through Jesus. This is a central tenet of Christian faith, emphasizing the redemptive work of Christ. The resurrection is not just a spiritual concept but a physical reality, as evidenced by Jesus' own resurrection. This connects to prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who would bear the sins of many. The resurrection is seen as the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep, as mentioned later in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>, indicating that Christ's resurrection is a precursor and guarantee of the future resurrection of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, whose disobedience led to sin and death entering the world.

The logic is clear and sequential, just like <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12&#8211;19</a>, where one historic event (Adam&#8217;s sin) leads to a universal consequence (death). By starting this way, the Spirit reminds us that redemption is not a random afterthought but a purposeful response to a real-world problem.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Death came through a man</b><p>&#8226; Paul is referring to Adam, the first human. <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a> records God&#8217;s warning, and <a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6&#8211;7</a> describes Adam&#8217;s deliberate disobedience.<p>&#8226; Because Adam was the representative head of humanity, his fall brought physical death and spiritual separation to every person (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a> &#8220;in Adam all die&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Death is therefore not a metaphor or merely spiritual; it is literal, universal, and observable, validating the truthfulness of Genesis and the need for a Savior.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The resurrection of the dead comes</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Resurrection&#8221; answers death directly; it is the bodily raising of those who have died (<a href="/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28&#8211;29</a>).<p>&#8226; This is not resuscitation or reincarnation but a once-for-all transformation (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; By using the present tense &#8220;comes,&#8221; Paul stresses that the provision is already secured and in motion since Christ&#8217;s own resurrection (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Also through a man</b><p>&#8226; The contrast is deliberate: one man brought death, another Man brings life. That Man is Jesus Christ, fully God yet fully human (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Because He took on genuine humanity, He could die in our place (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>) and rise as &#8220;the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a> affirms that God &#8220;has provided proof to everyone by raising Him from the dead,&#8221; underscoring the historical, literal nature of Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Adam&#8217;s single act opened the floodgates of death for every person, making the grave an unavoidable reality. God&#8217;s answer is just as concrete: Jesus, the second Man, conquered the grave and guarantees bodily resurrection to all who belong to Him. The verse sets a simple but profound equation&#8212;one man caused death; one Man secures life&#8212;highlighting both humanity&#8217;s need and God&#8217;s gracious provision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">For since by man . . .</span>--The image of the firstfruits is followed up by an explanation of the unity of Christ and Humanity.
