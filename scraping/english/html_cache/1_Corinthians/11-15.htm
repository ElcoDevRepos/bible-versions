The Greco-Roman world often associated long hair with beauty and honor for women. This phrase suggests a natural order or design, where long hair is seen as appropriate for women. In biblical terms, this can be connected to the idea of creation order, where distinctions between male and female are emphasized (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). The emphasis on long hair also reflects the cultural norms of modesty and propriety in worship settings.<p><b>it is her glory?</b><br>The term "glory" here implies honor and dignity. In biblical language, glory often refers to something that reflects God's order and purpose. A woman's long hair is seen as a natural adornment that brings her honor. This can be compared to <a href="/proverbs/16-31.htm">Proverbs 16:31</a>, where gray hair is described as a crown of glory, symbolizing wisdom and honor. The idea is that a woman's long hair is a visible sign of her femininity and the role she plays in God's creation.<p><b>For long hair is given to her</b><br>This phrase suggests that long hair is a gift or provision from God. It implies a divine intention behind the natural differences between men and women. The concept of something being "given" by God is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing God's sovereignty and purpose in creation (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). This can also be seen as a parallel to the spiritual gifts given to believers, each serving a specific role within the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>).<p><b>as a covering.</b><br>The term "covering" here is significant in the context of head coverings discussed earlier in the chapter (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5-6</a>). While the cultural practice of wearing a physical head covering in worship is debated, this phrase suggests that long hair itself serves as a natural covering. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God providing for His creation, ensuring that each part fulfills its intended role. The covering can also symbolize protection and honor, much like the spiritual covering provided by Christ to the church (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostle_paul.htm">Apostle Paul</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth regarding issues of worship and conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and cultural influences, which often led to challenges in maintaining Christian practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, struggling with issues of unity, morality, and proper worship practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/women_in_the_corinthian_church.htm">Women in the Corinthian Church</a></b><br>Specifically addressed in this passage concerning their appearance and roles in worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_practices.htm">Cultural Practices</a></b><br>The societal norms of the time regarding gender roles and appearance, which influenced the church's practices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_cultural_context.htm">Understanding Cultural Context</a></b><br>Recognize the cultural significance of long hair in ancient Corinth as a symbol of femininity and honor.

After praising the church for holding to the traditions he delivered (v. 2), he reminds them of the divine order: &#8220;the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God&#8221; (v. 3). Everything that follows, including verse 15, flows from this creation-based hierarchy (cf. <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18, 21</a>-23) and aims to display it visibly during public prayer and prophesying.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;It Is Her Glory&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Glory&#8221; speaks of honor and reflected splendor (cf. <a href="/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-3.htm">Isaiah 62:3</a>).<p>&#8226; A woman&#8217;s long hair is not merely ornamental; it showcases God&#8217;s good design for femininity, just as man &#8220;is the image and glory of God&#8221; while &#8220;woman is the glory of man&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter likewise points to a woman&#8217;s adornment that honors God, prioritizing &#8220;the hidden person of the heart&#8221; yet acknowledging outward appearance (<a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God&#8217;s Design and Order</b><p>&#8226; Creation establishes complementary distinctions: &#8220;male and female He created them&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul appeals to nature itself: &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-14.htm">1 Corinthians 11:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Maintaining visible markers of masculinity and femininity upholds God&#8217;s ordering (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-5.htm">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>, which warns against blurring gender expression).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Long Hair as a Natural Covering</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;long hair is given to her as a covering&#8221; clarifies that God has already provided women with a built-in veil, signifying her place in creation.<p>&#8226; Paul contrasts this natural covering with the optional fabric veil mentioned earlier (vv. 5-6, 10). Even if cultural customs shift, the God-given covering remains.<p>&#8226; By honoring this natural provision, a woman publicly affirms her respect for God&#8217;s design and for the headship structure (cf. <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Practical Application</b><p>&#8226; Embrace your God-assigned identity&#8212;distinct male and female expressions glorify the Creator (<a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4</a>).<p>&#8226; In gathered worship, aim for attire and grooming that confirm, not confuse, those distinctions.<p>&#8226; For women, long hair functions as an ongoing testimony of humble submission to God&#8217;s order; for men, shorter hair signals leadership under Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The passage never ties a woman&#8217;s worth to her hair length; it ties her visible testimony to obedience. Inner godliness and outward symbolism work together.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/11-15.htm">1 Corinthians 11:15</a> teaches that a woman&#8217;s long hair, given by God, honors her and visibly proclaims His created order.
