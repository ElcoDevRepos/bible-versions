The church in Corinth was established by Paul during his second missionary journey (<a href="/acts/18.htm">Acts 18:1-11</a>). The phrase "church of God" emphasizes that the church belongs to God, not to any human leader. This is significant in a city known for its diverse religious practices and idolatry. The church's location in Corinth highlights the transformative power of the Gospel in a challenging cultural environment.<p><b>to those sanctified in Christ Jesus</b><br>Sanctification refers to being set apart for God's purposes. In Christ Jesus, believers are made holy, not by their own merit, but through the redemptive work of Christ. This sanctification is both a positional reality and an ongoing process. The Corinthian believers, despite their struggles with sin, are reminded of their identity in Christ. This echoes the Old Testament concept of Israel being set apart as God's holy people (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>).<p><b>and called to be holy</b><br>The call to holiness is a recurring theme in Scripture, reflecting God's nature and His desire for His people to reflect His character (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). In the context of Corinth, a city rife with immorality, this call underscores the countercultural nature of the Christian life. Holiness involves both separation from sin and dedication to God.<p><b>together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the universal nature of the Christian faith. Believers in Corinth are part of a larger body of Christ that transcends geographical and cultural boundaries. Calling on the name of the Lord is an expression of faith and dependence on Jesus for salvation, echoing <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a> and <a href="/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>. It signifies a personal relationship with Christ and a shared identity among all believers.<p><b>their Lord and ours</b><br>This affirms the unity of believers under the lordship of Jesus Christ. Despite diverse backgrounds and locations, all Christians acknowledge Jesus as their Lord. This unity is a central theme in Paul's letters, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>. It challenges divisions within the church and calls believers to live in harmony, reflecting the oneness of the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the church in Corinth.

<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a> celebrates the church &#8220;which He purchased with His own blood,&#8221; underscoring divine ownership. &#8226; Even though Corinth was a bustling, imperfect city (see <a href="/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1&#8211;11</a>), God had staked His claim there, proving that location and culture never limit His reach. &#8226; <a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a> calls the church &#8220;the household of God,&#8221; reinforcing the family identity Paul highlights from the start.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to those sanctified in Christ Jesus</b><p>&#8220;Sanctified&#8221;

<a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a> portrays baptism as an appeal to His name, reinforcing the shared confession that unites believers worldwide. &#8226; This phrase dissolves geographic, ethnic, and cultural barriers, demonstrating that every believer&#8212;whether in Corinth or any modern city&#8212;shares the same spiritual address.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their Lord and ours</b><p>One Lord means one authority and one allegiance. &#8226;

The term "saints" is never used by St. Paul with its restricted modern meaning, but is applied to the whole baptised Church. The English word which most nearly expresses the apostolic idea is "Christians"--used in its most comprehensive sense.<p><span class= "bld">With all that in every place.</span>--Better translated, <span class= "ital">with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours.</span> The teaching of the Epistle is thus addressed to the Church at large, which is composed of all who call upon the Lord Jesus, whether it be in Corinth ("our" country--the Apostle identifying himself with his converts) or elsewhere. This idea of the Church, put forward in the very opening of the Epistle, at once directs the reader's mind from the narrow spirit of faction which was exhibiting itself at Corinth. The words of this verse contain a strong testimony to the worship of Christ, not only as being practised in the Apostolic Church, but as being one of the very marks of true union with the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Church.</span> This form of address is used in 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians. In St. Paul's later Epistles, for some unknown reason, he prefers the address "to the saints." These forms of address show the absence of any fixed ecclesiastical government. He does not in this Epistle address any "bishops" or "presbyters" whom he might regard as responsible for the growing disorders which prevailed at Corinth, but he appeals to the whole Church. The word <span class="accented">ecclesia</span> - signifying those who were "called out of the world," and so primarily applied to "the congregation of Israel" - came ultimately to mean "a congregation." The only apostle who uses the word "synagogue" of the Christian assemblies is St. James (<a href="/james/2-2.htm">James 2:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of God.</span> Not the Church of this or that party leader. Some commentators give to these words an emphasis and importance which does not seem to belong to them. <span class="cmt_word">Which is at Corinth.</span> So in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-2.htm">2 Corinthians 1:2</a>. In 1 and 2 Thessalonians he prefers the form, "the Church of the <span class="accented">Thessalonians."</span> "The Church at Corinth" was an expression which involved the sharpest of contrasts. It brought into juxtaposition the holiest ideal of the new faith and the vilest degradations of the old paganism. It was "a glad and great paradox" (Bengel). The condition of society at Corinth, at once depraved and sophistical, throws light on many parts of the Epistle. Cicero describes the city as <span class="accented">"illus</span>trious a like for <span class="accented">wantonness</span>, opulence, and the study of philosophy." <span class="cmt_word">Even them that are sanctified.</span> The apostles could only write to Churches as being <span class="accented">really</span> Churches, and to Christians as being true Christians. In all general addresses they could only assume that the <span class="accented">actual</span> resembled the <span class="accented">ideal.</span> They never conceal the immense chasm which separated the real condition of many members of their Churches from the vocation which they professed. They <span class="accented">knew</span> also that it is (as Calvin says) "a perilous temptation to refuse the name of Church to every Church in which there is not perfect purity." Ideally even the Corinthian Christians were redeemed by Christ's expiation, consecrated and sanctified by the work of the Holy Spirit. They could only be addressed in accordance with their ostensible position (see Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 3:1; 5:68). Our Prayer book is constructed on the same principle. The harvest is still a harvest, though amongst the corn there may be many tares. <span class="cmt_word">In Christ Jesus</span>. The words, "in Christ," constitute what has been happily called "the monogram of St. Paul." The life of the true Christian is no longer his own. The Christ for him has become the Christ <span class="accented">in</span> him. His natural life is merged into a higher spiritual life. Baptized <span class="accented">into</span> Christ, he has become one with Christ. Called to be saints. (On this Christian calling, see <a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1, 4</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:11</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-10.htm">2 Peter 1:10</a>.) They are called to be united saints, not schismatic partisans or members of antagonistic cliques. The description of what they were <span class="accented">ideally</span> is the more emphatic because he feels how much they had fallen away. <span class="cmt_word">With all that... in every place.</span> Perhaps this may mean the same as <a href="/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>, "With all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia;" or the words may imply that St. Paul's exhortations are applicable to all Christians, wherever they may be and (as is expressed in the next clause) whatever may be their varying shades of individual opinion. It was well in any case to remind the Corinthians that they formed but a fraction of the Christian communities. Catholicity, not provincialism, makes the true Church of God. <span class="cmt_word">Call upon the Name.</span> The Greek verb is here in the middle voice, not "who are called by the Name"(comp. <a href="/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>; <a href="/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>, LXX.). It means, therefore, all who reverence the Name of Christ, all who adore their one "Lord" in the fulness of his nature (see <a href="/joel/3-5.htm">Joel 3:5</a>; <a href="/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>; <a href="/romans/10.htm">Romans 10</a>:24; <a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>, etc.); in other words, "all who profess and call themselves Christians" (comp. <a href="/acts/25-11.htm">Acts 25:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their Lord and ours</span>. I connect these words, not with "place," as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">In omni loco ipsorum et nostro -</span> which, however it may be twisted, can give no good sense - but with "Jesus Christ." It has been in all ages a fatal temptation of party Christians to claim a monopoly of Christ for themselves and their own sects, as though <span class="accented">they</span> only taught the gospel, and were the <span class="accented">only</span> Christians or the <span class="accented">only</span> "Evangelicals." But Christ cannot thus be "parcelled into fragments" (see vers. 12, 13), nor has any party a right to boast exclusively, "I am of Christ." The addition, "and ours," could not be regarded as super fluous in writing to a Church of which one section wanted to assert an exclusive right in Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">To the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#8135;</span> <span class="translit">(T&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
