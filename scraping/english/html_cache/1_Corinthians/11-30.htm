The context is a warning against taking the sacrament in an unworthy manner, which includes divisions, selfishness, and lack of reverence. The phrase indicates a direct consequence of their actions.<p><b>many among you are weak and sick</b><br>Paul identifies physical ailments as a divine judgment for the Corinthians' irreverence. In the biblical context, God sometimes uses physical conditions to discipline His people, as seen in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27-28</a>). This serves as a call to self-examination and repentance. The mention of "many" suggests that this was a widespread issue within the Corinthian church, highlighting the seriousness of their misconduct.<p><b>and a number of you have fallen asleep</b><br>"Fallen asleep" is a euphemism for death, commonly used in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11-14</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-15</a>). This phrase underscores the severity of the consequences for their actions. The use of "fallen asleep" rather than "died" reflects the Christian hope of resurrection, as sleep implies eventual awakening.

Verse 29 adds, &#8220;For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment on himself&#8221;. The connecting phrase &#8220;That is why&#8221; draws a straight line from careless participation in the Lord&#8217;s Supper to the disciplinary consequences that follow. God&#8217;s discipline is never random; it is a purposeful response to irreverence (see <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>many among you are weak</b><p>&#8226; Weakness here includes both spiritual and physical frailty.<p>&#8226; The Lord sometimes withholds strength to alert His children that something is wrong (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3-4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; This weakness is corrective, not condemnatory.
