The phrase "actually reported" suggests that the news of this immorality was widespread and well-known, indicating a serious issue within the church community. Sexual immorality, or "porneia" in Greek, refers to any illicit sexual activity outside the bounds of marriage as defined by Scripture. In the context of Corinth, a city known for its moral laxity and pagan worship practices, such behavior might have been more common, but it was not to be tolerated within the Christian community. This highlights the call for believers to live distinctively holy lives, set apart from the surrounding culture.<p><b>and of a kind that is intolerable even among pagans</b><br>Paul emphasizes the severity of the sin by comparing it to the standards of the non-Christian world. The term "pagans" refers to the Gentiles who were not part of the Jewish or Christian faiths. Even in a city like Corinth, known for its permissive attitudes towards sexual practices, this particular sin was considered unacceptable. This underscores the gravity of the situation and the need for the church to uphold a higher moral standard. The church is called to be a light in the darkness, and tolerating such behavior would compromise its witness.<p><b>A man has his father&#8217;s wife</b><br>This phrase indicates a case of incest, which was explicitly condemned in the Old Testament (<a href="/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/22-30.htm">Deuteronomy 22:30</a>). The phrase "his father's wife" suggests that the woman involved was likely the man's stepmother, not his biological mother. This type of relationship was not only against Jewish law but also frowned upon in Roman society. The use of the present tense "has" implies an ongoing relationship, further compounding the sin. This situation serves as a stark reminder of the need for church discipline and the importance of addressing sin within the community to maintain purity and integrity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the Corinthian church with authority and concern for their spiritual well-being.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>A Christian community in Corinth, known for its diverse and often problematic issues, including moral and ethical challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_in_sin.htm">The Man in Sin</a></b><br>An unnamed individual within the Corinthian church engaged in an immoral relationship with his father's wife, which is condemned by Paul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father's_wife.htm">The Father&#8217;s Wife</a></b><br>The woman involved in the immoral relationship, likely the man's stepmother, highlighting a breach of both moral and cultural norms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pagans.htm">The Pagans</a></b><br>Non-Christians in Corinth, whose moral standards are referenced to emphasize the severity of the sin within the church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sexual immorality is not just a personal failing but a community issue that affects the entire body of Christ.

Paul&#8217;s astonishment underscores how any verified, unrepentant sexual sin contradicts the holiness Christ expects.

The passage reminds believers to uphold God&#8217;s moral standards, practice biblical discipline, and guard the testimony of the gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">It is reported commonly.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">There is absolutely said to be fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles.</span> All the best MSS. omit the word "named."

St. Chrysostom suggests "he said not his 'stepmother,' but 'his father's wife,' so as to strike much more severely;" but probably St. Paul used the Hebrew phrase instead of the ordinary Greek word for "stepmother," as it was in this phraseology that such a union was forbidden by the law of Moses (<a href="/leviticus/18-8.htm" title="The nakedness of your father's wife shall you not uncover: it is your father's nakedness.">Leviticus 18:8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - <span class="accented">Excommunication of an incestuous offender.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is reported.</span> The abruptness with which the subject is introduced shows <span class="cmt_word">the</span> intensity of St. Paul's feelings, and his indignation that he should have been left to hear of this crime by common report.
