In biblical times, childhood was a period of learning and growth, often marked by a lack of understanding and experience. The Apostle Paul uses this imagery to describe the early stages of spiritual development. In Jewish culture, a child was not held to the same standards as an adult, reflecting a time of innocence and limited responsibility. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of growth and maturity in faith, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12-14</a>, where believers are encouraged to move beyond spiritual infancy.<p><b>I talked like a child</b><br>Speech is a primary indicator of maturity. In the ancient world, a child's speech was simple and often self-centered, lacking the depth and wisdom expected of an adult. This reflects the early Christian's understanding of spiritual truths, which may be superficial or incomplete. <a href="/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a> highlights the importance of mature speech as a sign of spiritual growth, emphasizing the need for believers to control their tongues as they mature in faith.<p><b>I thought like a child</b><br>Thinking like a child suggests a limited understanding and perspective. In the Greco-Roman context, children were not expected to engage in complex reasoning or decision-making. This phrase underscores the need for believers to develop a mature understanding of God's will and purpose. <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a> calls for the renewal of the mind, urging Christians to move beyond childish thinking to discern God's perfect will.<p><b>I reasoned like a child</b><br>Reasoning involves the ability to process information and make judgments. In the biblical context, a child's reasoning is often simplistic and self-focused. Paul contrasts this with the mature reasoning expected of believers, who are called to discern spiritual truths and apply them wisely. This echoes <a href="/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>, where Paul urges the church to be mature in their thinking, avoiding the pitfalls of childish reasoning.<p><b>When I became a man</b><br>This phrase marks the transition from spiritual infancy to maturity. In Jewish tradition, reaching adulthood was a significant milestone, often marked by a bar mitzvah, symbolizing the assumption of religious and moral responsibilities. Paul uses this cultural understanding to illustrate the believer's journey toward spiritual maturity, where one takes on the full responsibilities of faith and discipleship.<p><b>I set aside childish ways</b><br>Setting aside childish ways signifies a deliberate choice to embrace maturity. In the early church, this meant moving beyond elementary teachings and embracing the deeper truths of the gospel. <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14-15</a> encourages believers to grow in every way into Christ, leaving behind the instability of spiritual childhood. This transformation is a key aspect of Christian discipleship, reflecting the call to become more like Christ in character and conduct.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, providing guidance on spiritual maturity and love.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and moral challenges, which Paul addresses in his letters.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, struggling with issues of division, immorality, and spiritual immaturity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_maturity.htm">Spiritual Maturity</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes the importance of growing in faith and understanding, moving beyond immature ways of thinking and behaving.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_in_christ.htm">Transformation in Christ</a></b><br>The transition from childhood to adulthood in faith signifies a transformation that should be evident in our actions and thoughts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/setting_aside_childish_ways.htm">Setting Aside Childish Ways</a></b><br>Believers are called to examine their lives for areas where immaturity persists and to actively pursue growth and maturity in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_love_in_maturity.htm">The Role of Love in Maturity</a></b><br>In the context of <a href="/bsb/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, love is the ultimate expression of spiritual maturity, guiding our actions and interactions with others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuous_growth.htm">Continuous Growth</a></b><br>Spiritual maturity is a lifelong journey, requiring continual learning, reflection, and application of God's Word.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_13_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 13:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_13_11_s_role_in_daily_spiritual_growth.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 13:11 encourage spiritual maturity in daily life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_put_aside_childish_ways.htm">What does "put aside childish ways" mean for personal spiritual growth?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Ephesians_4_14-15_to_1_Cor_13_11.htm">How can Ephesians 4:14-15 deepen understanding of 1 Corinthians 13:11?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_maturely_reason_in_faith_practices.htm">In what ways can you "reason like an adult" in faith practices?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_when_I_became_a_man_now.htm">How can you apply "when I became a man" to current challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_13_11_s_link_to_spiritual_maturity.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 13:11 relate to spiritual maturity in a believer's life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_putting_away_childish_things.htm">What does "putting away childish things" mean in the context of Christian growth?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_13_11_s_take_on_personal_growth.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 13:11 challenge our understanding of personal transformation?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_corinthians_13.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Corinthians 13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/evidence_of_spiritual_maturity_in_1_cor_13_11.htm">In 1 Corinthians 13:11, what historical or archaeological evidence exists to support the idea of spiritual maturity beyond cultural norms of the time? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'put_away_childish_things'_mean.htm">What does "put away childish things" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_fearing_god_avoid_extremes.htm">What does 'put away childish things' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/are_greek_gods_mentioned_in_the_bible.htm">What is the concept of an 'inner child'?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 1 Corinthians 13:11 Mean</div><b>When I was a child</b><p>Paul begins with an honest admission of an earlier stage of life. Childhood is real, God-given, and marked by dependence and growth. Scripture cherishes children (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>; <a href="/mark/10-14.htm">Mark 10:14</a>), yet also shows that childhood is not the goal but a season that should lead to maturity (<a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>). In context, Paul is comparing the present life of partial understanding to the future perfection believers will enjoy with Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-10.htm">1 Corinthians 13:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I talked like a child</b><p>Speech is the first evidence Paul cites. Children speak sincerely but limitedly.<p>&#8226; Their words often center on self and immediate needs.<p>&#8226; They lack discernment and restraint.<p><a href="/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a> notes, &#8220;If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s point: immature love shows up in immature speech&#8212;self-promoting, impatient, or ungracious words (contrast <a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4&#8211;5</a>). Growth in Christ transforms the tongue into an instrument of edification (<a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I thought like a child</b><p>Thought life shapes everything else (<a href="/proverbs/23-7.htm">Proverbs 23:7</a>). A child&#8217;s thoughts are fragmented and short-sighted. Likewise, believers who cling to jealousy or pride (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1&#8211;3</a>) reveal childish thinking. <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a> calls for the renewing of the mind so that we may &#8220;approve what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God.&#8221; Mature love thinks beyond self and beyond the moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I reasoned like a child</b><p>Reasoning involves conclusions and judgments. Children reason with limited data and often from emotion. In spiritual terms, this shows up as:<p>&#8226; Misreading trials as God&#8217;s displeasure (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Preferring visible gifts over unseen virtues (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-22.htm">1 Corinthians 12:22&#8211;24</a>).<p>Mature reasoning weighs everything against God&#8217;s unchanging truth (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16&#8211;17</a>) and eternity (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When I became a man</b><p>Paul signals a decisive transition. Maturity is not accidental; it comes through intentional yielding to the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>) and consistent exposure to Scripture (<a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>). The perfect &#8220;man&#8221; ultimately portrayed is Christ Himself (<a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>). Until we see Him face to face (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>), we press on toward that standard (<a href="/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I set aside childish ways</b><p>Growth requires putting off as well as putting on (<a href="/colossians/3-8.htm">Colossians 3:8&#8211;10</a>). Paul&#8217;s wording shows purposeful renunciation:<p>&#8226; Replacing immature speech with truth in love (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Trading shallow thoughts for Christ-centered meditation (<a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Abandoning self-focused reasoning for humble, sacrificial love (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>).<p>The Holy Spirit enables this exchange (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/13-11.htm">1 Corinthians 13:11</a> contrasts childish and mature love. Childishness speaks, thinks, and reasons from a limited, self-centered perspective. Maturity, modeled by Christ, displays controlled speech, renewed thoughts, and sound reasoning rooted in Scripture. Paul urges believers to embrace the Spirit-led process of setting aside childish ways, growing up into the fullness of love that will one day be perfected when we see the Lord face to face.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">When I was a child.</span>--The natural childhood and manhood of this life are analogous to the spiritual childhood of this life and the spiritual manhood of the life to come.<p><span class= "bld">I understood as a child, I thought as a child.</span>--The first word expresses mere simple apprehension, the second word implies active intellectual exertion.
