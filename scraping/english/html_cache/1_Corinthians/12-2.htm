The term "pagans" refers to Gentiles who were outside the covenant community of Israel and engaged in polytheistic worship. In the Greco-Roman world, Corinth was a city known for its diverse religious practices and numerous temples dedicated to various gods and goddesses. This context highlights the radical transformation the Corinthians experienced upon embracing the Christian faith. The acknowledgment of their past serves as a reminder of the grace and redemption they received through Christ, aligning with passages like <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13</a>, which speaks of Gentiles being brought near by the blood of Christ.<p><b>you were influenced and led astray</b><br>The phrase "influenced and led astray" suggests a passive state where the Corinthians were subject to external forces that directed their spiritual lives. This reflects the pervasive influence of the cultural and religious environment in Corinth, where idol worship was prevalent. The language implies a lack of control or awareness, indicating that their previous spiritual state was one of deception and bondage. This aligns with the biblical theme of spiritual blindness and the need for enlightenment through the Holy Spirit, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, where the god of this age blinds the minds of unbelievers.<p><b>to mute idols</b><br>The term "mute idols" emphasizes the lifeless and powerless nature of the gods the Corinthians once worshiped. Unlike the living God who speaks and acts, these idols were silent and impotent, unable to provide guidance or salvation. This critique of idolatry is consistent with Old Testament passages such as <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, which mock the futility of idol worship. The contrast between the mute idols and the living God underscores the transformative power of the gospel, which brings believers into a relationship with a God who communicates and interacts with His people. This transformation is a type of the new life in Christ, who is the true and living Word of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and diversity, but also for its moral and spiritual challenges.

In this and the following verse the Apostle reminds his readers that so far from regarding the marvellous manifestations of the Spirit, such as speaking with tongues and prophesying, as the most wonderful miracles, the greatest miracle of all was their conversion. That blind followers of dumb idols should be transformed into intelligent believers in the living Word was the most striking work of the Spirit. They were now no longer led hither and thither by diverse teachings and diverse gods; they had an unchanging principle of life, and an unerring guide of conduct. The contrast of the present state of Christians with their former state as heathens is a topic of frequent occurrence in St. Paul's writings (<a href="/romans/11-30.htm" title="For as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:">Romans 11:30</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-7.htm" title=" In the which you also walked some time, when you lived in them.">Colossians 3:7</a>, &c.).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That ye were Gentiles.</span> The undoubted reading is, <span class="accented">that when ye were Gentiles.</span> The sentence is then in form an <span class="accented">anacoluthon</span>; in other words, it is not grammatically finished. The ancients were much less particular about these small matters of precision and symmetry than the moderns; and writers who are deeply moved by their subject, and hurried along by the strength of their feelings, often fall into these unfinished constructions (see <a href="/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-21</a>; <a href="/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25-27</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>, etc., in the Greek). <span class="cmt_word">Dumb idols.</span> This characteristic of idols (<a href="/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/115-5.htm">Psalm 115:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/135-16.htm">Psalm 135:16</a>) is fixed upon to show that their "oracles" were mere falsity and pretence. We find an illustration of the epithet in the statue of Isis at Pompeii, where the ruined temple shows the secret stair by which the priest mounted to the back of the statue; and the <span class="accented">head</span> of the statue (preserved in the Museo Borbonico) shows the tube which went from the back of the head to the parted lips.
