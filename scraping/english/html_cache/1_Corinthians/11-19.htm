In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul addresses the Corinthian church's issues, including factions and disputes. Historically, Corinth was a diverse and cosmopolitan city, which contributed to various cultural and philosophical influences within the church. The divisions may have been exacerbated by differing backgrounds and beliefs. Biblically, this reflects the broader theme of unity and division seen throughout the New Testament, such as in <a href="/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17</a>, where Paul warns against those who cause divisions contrary to the doctrine.<p><b>to show which of you are approved</b><br>The term "approved" suggests a process of testing or proving one's faith and character. In the early church, trials and divisions often served to reveal genuine believers, as seen in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, where trials are said to produce perseverance and maturity. This concept is also echoed in <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>, where faith is tested by fire to prove its genuineness. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who was tested and proven through His sufferings and obedience, as described in <a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8-9</a>. The idea of being "approved" aligns with the biblical call to live a life worthy of the gospel, as seen in <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance and correction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often divided early Christian community facing issues of unity and practice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/divisions_in_the_church.htm">Divisions in the Church</a></b><br>The context of the letter, where Paul addresses the factions and divisions among believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/approved_believers.htm">Approved Believers</a></b><br>Those who are recognized as genuine and faithful through the testing of divisions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_supper.htm">The Lord's Supper</a></b><br>The immediate context of the passage, where Paul discusses proper conduct during this sacred observance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_differences.htm">The Necessity of Differences</a></b><br>Differences and divisions can serve a purpose in revealing the true character and faithfulness of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_and_approval.htm">Discernment and Approval</a></b><br>Believers are called to discern who among them is truly approved by God, which requires spiritual maturity and wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>While differences exist, the ultimate goal is unity in Christ.

By saying, &#8220;And indeed,&#8221; he acknowledges that what he is about to state is not hypothetical but a present reality among them.<p>&#8226; He speaks as an eyewitness apostle, confirming that the report of factions is accurate (compare <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture never minimizes sin; it names it plainly, then redirects the church toward God&#8217;s purpose (<a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11-14</a> shows a similar forthright approach).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there must be differences among you</b><p>The &#8220;differences&#8221; (factions) are not ideal, yet Paul says they &#8220;must&#8221; occur.

From all that we know of the Apostolic Church it is clear that neither of these words can mean sects separated from the Church, but "parties" in the Church. Christ had foretold (<a href="/matthew/18-7.htm" title="Woe to the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!">Matthew 18:7</a>) that "stumbling-blocks," or "scandals," must arise in the Church, and it is possible that our Lord on some occasion spoke of these as "sects" (Justin Martyr attributes the use of this very word to our Lord); and St. Paul, possibly, uses the word here because it was the one traditionally reported as having been used by Christ in some of His unrecorded utterances. Christ has foretold that in the divine economy of permission such divisions will arise. They are allowed because this is a state of continual judgment; and the existence of such "offences" will be God's means of manifesting those who are void of offence, and those who are not.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There must be also heresies among you.</span> It results from the inevitable decrees of the Divine providence.

The mutually railing factions, which in their Church newspapers and elsewhere bandy about their false and rival charges of "heresy," are illustrating the virulence of the very sin which they are professing to denounce - the sin of factiousness. <span class="cmt_word">That they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</span> Similarly St. John (<a href="/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>) speaks of the aberrations of false teachers as destined to prove that they did not belong to the true Church.
