In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/7.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>, Paul is responding to questions from the Corinthian church about marriage and singleness. The cultural backdrop includes a society where marriage was often seen as a social obligation. Paul emphasizes the sanctity and commitment of marriage, reflecting <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where a man is united with his wife. The commitment to a wife is a covenantal relationship, mirroring God's covenant with His people.<p><b>Do not seek to be released.</b><br>Paul advises against seeking divorce, aligning with Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>, where He states that what God has joined together, man should not separate. In the Greco-Roman world, divorce was relatively common and could be initiated by either party. Paul&#8217;s instruction underscores the permanence of marriage and the importance of faithfulness, reflecting God's unwavering commitment to His covenant with humanity.<p><b>Are you free of commitment?</b><br>This phrase refers to those who are unmarried or possibly widowed. In the early church, there was a debate about the virtues of singleness versus marriage. Paul acknowledges the benefits of singleness for undivided devotion to the Lord, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-32.htm">1 Corinthians 7:32-35</a>. The freedom from marital commitment allows for greater flexibility in ministry and service, echoing the life of Jesus, who was single and fully devoted to His mission.<p><b>Do not look for a wife.</b><br>Paul advises those who are single not to actively seek marriage, especially in light of the "present crisis" mentioned earlier in the chapter (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>). This could refer to specific challenges faced by the Corinthian church or the broader eschatological expectation of Christ's return. The advice is not a prohibition against marriage but a call to prioritize spiritual matters and remain content in one's current state, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-12</a>. This reflects the idea that one's identity and fulfillment are found in Christ, not in marital status.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on marriage and singleness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and moral challenges, which influenced the issues Paul addresses in his letters.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a community of believers navigating their faith amidst a culturally complex environment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_commitment.htm">Understanding Commitment</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes the importance of honoring one's current marital status.

Verse 28 follows immediately: &#8220;But if you do marry, you have not sinned.&#8221; Instead, Paul offers a wise, Spirit-inspired perspective for believers weighing life choices in a challenging cultural moment.<p>&#8226; Remaining single may spare a believer &#8220;many troubles in this life&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-28.htm">1 Corinthians 7:28</a>), such as divided loyalties under persecution or economic strain.
