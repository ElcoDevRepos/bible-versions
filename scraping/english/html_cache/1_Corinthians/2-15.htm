This distinction is crucial in understanding the context of Paul's letter to the Corinthians, where he contrasts worldly wisdom with divine wisdom. The ability to "judge all things" implies discernment and understanding that comes from the Spirit, allowing the believer to evaluate and understand spiritual truths (1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>). This echoes the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as Proverbs, where wisdom and discernment are highly valued (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6-9</a>).<p><b>but he himself is not subject to anyone&#8217;s judgment</b><br>This phrase highlights the idea that the spiritual man, being led by the Spirit, is not subject to the judgment of those who do not possess spiritual discernment. This does not mean that the spiritual person is above accountability or correction within the body of Christ (<a href="/galatians/6.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>), but rather that their spiritual insights and actions cannot be fully understood or evaluated by those who lack the Spirit. This reflects Jesus' own experience, as He was often misunderstood and judged by those who did not recognize His divine mission (<a href="/john/7-24.htm">John 7:24</a>). The spiritual man&#8217;s ultimate accountability is to God, who alone fully understands the heart and mind (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">1 Corinthians 4:3-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, a city known for its diverse culture and moral challenges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A Christian community in a cosmopolitan city, struggling with issues of division, immorality, and spiritual immaturity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_man.htm">Spiritual Man</a></b><br>Refers to a person who is guided by the Holy Spirit, possessing spiritual discernment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/natural_man.htm">Natural Man</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the context contrasts the spiritual man with the natural man, who lacks spiritual discernment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The act of discerning or evaluating, particularly in a spiritual context.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discernment.htm">Spiritual Discernment</a></b><br>The spiritual man has the ability to discern and evaluate all things through the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
