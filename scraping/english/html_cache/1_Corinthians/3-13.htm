In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul addresses the divisions within the Corinthian church, urging believers to focus on their spiritual growth and unity. The "workmanship" refers to the spiritual foundation and growth that each believer builds upon the foundation of Jesus Christ. This echoes <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, where believers are described as God's workmanship, created for good works. The visibility of one's spiritual work is not just in the present but will be fully revealed in the future.<p><b>because the Day will bring it to light</b><br>"The Day" refers to the Day of the Lord, a concept rooted in Old Testament prophecy (e.g., <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>, <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>) and further developed in the New Testament as the time of Christ's return and final judgment. This day will illuminate the true nature of each person's work, separating genuine spiritual contributions from those that are superficial or self-serving. The imagery of light is often used in Scripture to denote truth and revelation (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-13.htm">Ephesians 5:13</a>).<p><b>It will be revealed with fire</b><br>Fire in biblical terms often symbolizes purification and judgment (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>). In this context, fire serves as a divine test to reveal the true quality of each person's work. The use of fire as a metaphor underscores the thoroughness and intensity of God's judgment, which will purify and refine, leaving only what is genuine and valuable. This aligns with the refining process described in <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>, where fire is used to purify and test.<p><b>and the fire will prove the quality of each man&#8217;s work</b><br>The phrase underscores the individual responsibility each believer has in their spiritual journey. The "quality" of one's work is not measured by human standards but by divine criteria, which assess the faithfulness, sincerity, and alignment with God's will. This concept is echoed in <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>, where Jesus speaks of building one's house on the rock, emphasizing the importance of a solid foundation and enduring work. The testing by fire ensures that only what is built on the foundation of Christ will endure, highlighting the eternal significance of our earthly actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, providing guidance and correction on various issues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often divided early Christian community dealing with issues of immaturity and division.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day.htm">The Day</a></b><br>Refers to the Day of Judgment, a future event when Christ will return, and the works of believers will be tested.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fire.htm">Fire</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's judgment and purification, used to test the quality of each person's work.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers'_works.htm">Believers' Works</a></b><br>The actions and efforts of Christians, which will be evaluated for their eternal value and quality.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_judgment.htm">The Certainty of Judgment</a></b><br>Believers should live with the awareness that their works will be tested by God.

As the nominative is not expressed, it is uncertain whether "it" refers to "each man's work" or to" the day." Either gives an apposite sense (<a href="/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>). Some would make "he" (namely, Christ) the nominative, because "the day" means "the day of Christ;" and in favour of this view they quote <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>, "The revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven in flaming fire." But the ellipse of an unexpressed nominative is harsh. <span class="cmt_word">The fire itself shall prove each man's work.</span> This is the "probatory" or testing fire of the day of the Lord, of which we read very frequently in the Fathers. The doctrine of purgatory has been in some measure founded on this verse (Council of Florence, A.D. 1439); but such a view of it cannot be maintained. The reader will find the subject examined and the quotations from the Fathers given in the writer's 'Mercy and Judgment,' p. 69. All that is said here is that the fire of Christ's presence - the consuming fire of God's love - shall <span class="accented">test</span> the work, not <span class="accented">purge</span> it. The fire is <span class="accented">probatory</span>, not <span class="accented">purgatorial</span>, and it is not in itself a fife of wrath, for it tests the gold and silver as well as the inferior elements of the structure. It is the fire of the refiner, not of the avenger. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">his</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7953;&#954;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(hekastou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1538.htm">Strong's 1538: </a> </span><span class="str2">Each (of more than two), every one.
