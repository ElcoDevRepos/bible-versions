This phrase highlights the importance of apostolic authority and the personal relationship Paul had with the church in Corinth. In the Greco-Roman world, maintaining a connection with a teacher or leader was crucial for the transmission of knowledge and tradition. This commendation sets a positive tone before addressing more challenging issues later in the chapter. It reflects the biblical principle of honoring spiritual leaders, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>, which encourages believers to remember and imitate their leaders' faith.<p><b>and for maintaining the traditions</b><br>The term "traditions" refers to the teachings and practices that Paul had delivered to the Corinthians. In the early church, traditions were essential for preserving the teachings of Jesus and the apostles before the New Testament was fully compiled. These traditions included doctrinal teachings, moral instructions, and liturgical practices. The emphasis on maintaining traditions underscores the continuity and consistency of the Christian faith, as seen in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>, where Paul urges believers to stand firm and hold to the traditions taught by word or letter. This continuity is vital for the unity and identity of the church.<p><b>just as I passed them on to you</b><br>Paul emphasizes the faithful transmission of these traditions, highlighting the responsibility of both the teacher and the recipients. The phrase suggests a direct and unaltered passing of teachings, akin to the rabbinic tradition of oral transmission in Jewish culture. This method ensured the accuracy and integrity of the message. The phrase also reflects the biblical model of discipleship, where teachings are passed from one generation to the next, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>, where Paul instructs Timothy to entrust teachings to reliable people who can teach others. This model is foundational for the growth and sustainability of the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, Paul is addressing the Corinthian church, commending them for their adherence to the traditions he taught them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the church in Corinth was a diverse and dynamic community facing various challenges, including issues of unity and adherence to apostolic teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/traditions.htm">Traditions</a></b><br>Refers to the teachings and practices that Paul had delivered to the Corinthians, which were rooted in the teachings of Christ and the apostles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_apostolic_tradition.htm">The Importance of Apostolic Tradition</a></b><br>The traditions Paul refers to are not mere customs but are rooted in the teachings of Christ and the apostles.

The exhortation of the previous verse probably recalled to the Apostle's mind that to a certain extent the Corinthians did follow his teaching and example; and had possibly in their letter, to which he was now replying, boasted of their obedience. The rebuke which he is about to administer is, with characteristic courtesy, introduced with words of commendation. While there is a likeness in form in the original in the words "imitators" and "remember," the latter is weaker in its significance. He exhorts them to be "imitators." He praises them only for bearing him in mind in all things to the extent of obeying certain practical directions which he had given them. The word "ordinances," or <span class= "ital">traditions,</span> here refers to matters of Christian discipline (as in <a href="/acts/16-4.htm" title="And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.">Acts 16:4</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2Thessalonians 3:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-16.</span> - <span class="accented">Rules and principles respecting the covering of the head by women in Church assemblies.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but, on the other hand. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That ye remember me in all things, and keep,</span> etc. This is probably a quotation from their letter. He thanks them for this kind message, but points out one particular in which their practice was not quite commendable. The ordinances.
