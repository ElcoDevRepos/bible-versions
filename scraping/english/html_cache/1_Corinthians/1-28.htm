In the cultural context of Corinth, a city known for its wealth and social stratification, this would have been a radical statement. The "lowly and despised" could refer to those of humble social status, the poor, or those without influence. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where God chooses the unlikely, such as David, a shepherd boy, to be king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-13</a>), or Gideon, the least in his family, to deliver Israel (<a href="/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a>). It underscores the idea that God's power is made perfect in weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><b>and the things that are not</b><br>This phrase suggests the use of what is considered non-existent or insignificant by worldly standards. In a historical context, this could refer to those who lack social standing or power. Theologically, it points to God's ability to create ex nihilo, or out of nothing, as seen in the creation narrative (Genesis 1). It also connects to the concept of faith, which calls into existence things that do not exist (<a href="/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17</a>). This demonstrates God's sovereignty and His ability to bring about His will through unexpected means.<p><b>to nullify the things that are</b><br>Here, the purpose of God's choice is revealed: to nullify or bring to nothing the things that are esteemed by the world. This is a direct challenge to the values of the Corinthian society, which prized wisdom, power, and status. It echoes the theme of reversal found throughout Scripture, such as in the Magnificat where Mary proclaims that God has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble (<a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>). This phrase also points to the ultimate victory of God's kingdom, where the first will be last and the last will be first (<a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>). It serves as a reminder that God's ways are not our ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>), and His kingdom operates on principles that often contradict worldly wisdom.<div

After the words "hath God chosen" there is a slight pause, and then the Apostle describes all those things which he has declared to be God's choice, as things which "are not"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> do not in men's estimation even exist (<a href="/romans/4-17.htm" title="(As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who vivifies the dead, and calls those things which be not as though they were.">Romans 4:17</a>; <a href="/romans/9-25.htm" title="As he said also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.">Romans 9:25</a>; see also <a href="/job/34-19.htm" title="How much less to him that accepts not the persons of princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.">Job 34:19</a>; <a href="/job/34-24.htm" title="He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.">Job 34:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the base things;</span> literally, <span class="accented">low-born, unborn</span>; "those who are sprung kern no one in <span class="accented">particular" - nullo patre, nullis majoribus.</span> Nothing could be more ignoble in the eyes of the world than a cross of wood upheld by feeble hands, and yet before it <span class="accented">"kings</span> and their armies did flee and were discomfited, and they of the household divided the spoil." <span class="cmt_word">And the things that are not</span>.
