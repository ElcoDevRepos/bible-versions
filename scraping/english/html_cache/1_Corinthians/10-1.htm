It indicates a teaching moment where he desires the Corinthian believers to understand a significant spiritual truth. The term "brothers" reflects the familial relationship among believers, emphasizing unity and shared faith. This introduction sets the stage for a lesson drawn from Israel's history, which serves as a warning and an example for the church.<p><b>that our forefathers were all under the cloud</b><br>The "cloud" refers to the divine presence that guided the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt, as described in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>. This cloud was a manifestation of God's guidance and protection, symbolizing His presence with His people. It served as a type of Christ, who leads and protects His followers. The cloud's presence was a constant reminder of God's faithfulness and His covenant with Israel.<p><b>and that they all passed through the sea</b><br>This phrase refers to the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea, as recorded in <a href="/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>. The event is a powerful demonstration of God's deliverance and salvation, prefiguring Christian baptism as a passage from death to life. The crossing of the sea symbolizes liberation from bondage and the beginning of a new life, paralleling the believer's journey from sin to salvation through Christ.

The same kind of dangers still beset God's people, but they will never be greater than the strength which God will give to bear them. These thoughts are then applied to the immediate subject in hand, viz., the partaking of meat which had been used in the heathen temples. The subject is, as it were, taken up from <a href="/1_corinthians/8-13.htm" title="Why, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend.">1Corinthians 8:13</a>, where an expression of personal willingness to forego a right, led the writer aside to the subject which occupies 1 Corinthians 9. Uniting <a href="/1_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Be you followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.">1Corinthians 11:1</a>, with the last verse of this chapter, the general outline of the argument is as follows:--<p><a href="/context/1_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I would not that you should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;">1Corinthians 10:1-11</a>. The history of the Jewish Church contains examples which ought to be warnings against self-confidence.<p><a href="/context/1_corinthians/10-12.htm" title="Why let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.">1Corinthians 10:12-14</a>. These thoughts should make the Christians distrustful of themselves, but not hopeless.<p><a href="/context/1_corinthians/10-15.htm" title="I speak as to wise men; judge you what I say.">1Corinthians 10:15-17</a>.

In continuance of the same lesson, he teaches them historically that the possession of great privileges is no safeguard, and that the seductions, even of idolatry, must not be carelessly despised. Although the connection of the various paragraphs is not stated with logical precision, we see that they all bear on the one truth which he wants to inculcate, namely, that it is both wise and kind to limit our personal freedom out of sympathy with others. The reading "but" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, morever) is probably a correction of the true reading (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, for), due to the failure to understand the whole train of thought. <span class="cmt_word">I would not that ye should be ignorant.</span> This is a favourite phrase of St. Paul's (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>). The ignorance to which he refers is not ignorance of the facts, but of the <span class="accented">meaning</span> of the facts. <span class="cmt_word">All our fathers.</span> He repeats the "all" five times, because he wishes to show that, though "all" partook of spiritual blessings, most (ver. 5) fell in spite of them. He says, "our fathers," not only because he was himself a Jew, but also because the patriarchs and the Israelites were spiritually the fathers of the Christian Church. <span class="cmt_word">Were under the cloud.</span> The compressed Greek phrase implies that they <span class="accented">went</span> under it, and remained under its shadow.
