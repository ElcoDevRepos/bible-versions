In the context of Corinth, a city known for its diverse and often contentious culture, Paul's ministry faced scrutiny and criticism. The phrase "judged by you" refers to the Corinthian believers who were divided and questioning Paul's authority. The mention of "any human court" suggests a broader application, indicating that Paul is not concerned with human opinions or legal judgments. This reflects a theme found in <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>, where Paul emphasizes pleasing God rather than people. The cultural context of Corinth, a hub of philosophical debate and legal proceedings, underscores the significance of Paul's disregard for human judgment.<p><b>In fact, I do not even judge myself.</b><br>Paul's statement here highlights his reliance on God's judgment rather than self-assessment. This reflects a deep humility and recognition of human limitations in understanding one's own heart and motives. The phrase connects to <a href="/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>, where Paul acknowledges that his conscience is clear but that it does not justify him. This aligns with <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which speaks of the deceitfulness of the human heart. Paul's approach is a model of Christian humility, recognizing that ultimate judgment belongs to God alone. This perspective is consistent with the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/7.htm">Matthew 7:1-2</a>, where He warns against judging others, emphasizing that judgment is God's prerogative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

This perspective liberates believers to serve Christ faithfully, confident that His final evaluation is all that ultimately counts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">But with me it is a very small thing . . .</span>--As, however, the Corinthians had actually "judged" various of their teachers, the Apostle assures them that <span class= "ital">their</span> judgment--or the judgment of the world generally--is to him "a very small matter"--nay, no earthly judgment is of any concern to him. He does not even judge himself as worthy and faithful because he is not conscious of any unfaithfulness; yet that is no justification to him--his only judge is the Lord.<p><span class= "bld">Man's judgment.</span>--The literal translation is <span class= "ital">man's day.</span> Some have thought they saw in it a provincialism or a Hebraism. Probably, however, the explanation is that St. Paul lived with the idea of the day of the Lord as the judgment day so constantly before him, that he uses the words as synonymous. (Comp. also <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.">1Corinthians 3:13</a>, "the day shall declare it.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>. The Corinthians might have expected that the conclusion of St. Paul's remarks would be a recognition of their right to sit in judgment on his faithfulness; but it is, on the contrary, an expression of his complete indifference to their shallow and unfair estimate, and an appeal to the approval of his own conscience and to the judgment of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">It is a very small thing;</span> literally, <span class="accented">it is for the least. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That I should be judged of you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that I should be examined by you</span> (<span class="accented">anakritho</span>). Technically the word <span class="accented">anakrisis</span> means "an examination preliminary to trial." <span class="cmt_word">Or of man's judgment</span>; literally, <span class="accented">of man's day.</span> The brief day of human life is bounded by too narrow an horizon for accurate judgments. Many of the greatest and best men have felt, like Lord Bacon, that they must leave to other generations the right estimate of their characters, views, and actions. St. Jerome reckons the expression "day" for "judgment" among the "Cilicisms" of St. Paul (Jeremiah, 'Ad Algas.,' 10), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the expressions due to his early training in Cilicia. More probably (as Grotius thinks) there is a reference to the "day" fixed for earthly trials (<span class="accented">diem dicere</span>, equivalent to "to impeach"), and to the phrase "the day of judgment" - "the woeful day" of <a href="/jeremiah/17-16.htm">Jeremiah 17:16</a>. The word "day" in all languages and idioms signifies "judgment" (Hammond). From <span class="accented">dies</span>, a day, comes the phrase "a diet." A "daysman" means an arbitrator. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, I judge not mine own self.</span> Here, as in the previous clause and in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">1 Corinthians 6:4</a>, the verb is not <span class="accented">krino</span>, I judge, but <span class="accented">anakrino</span>, I examine. Thus the verse discourages all morbid self introspection. It also shows that St. Paul is not arrogantly proclaiming himself superior to the opinion of the Corinthians, but is pointing out the necessary inadequacy of all human judgments. The heart is too liable to self deceit (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9, 10</a>) to enable it to pronounce a judgment with unerring accuracy. Hence neither a man's contemporaries nor the man himself can form any final estimate of him or of his fitting position, because their knowledge is too imperfect. History often reverses the decision of contemporaries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#956;&#959;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Emoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
