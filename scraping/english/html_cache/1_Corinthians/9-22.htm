In the context of 1 Corinthians, "the weak" likely refers to those with a fragile conscience or limited understanding of Christian liberty, particularly concerning food offered to idols (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7-13</a>). Paul willingly adjusted his behavior to avoid causing them to stumble, demonstrating humility and love. This reflects Jesus' own ministry, where He identified with humanity's weaknesses (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p><b>to win the weak</b><br>Paul's ultimate goal was evangelism and discipleship. "Winning" here implies leading others to a deeper understanding of the Gospel and a stronger faith. This aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and echoes Jesus' mission to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). Paul's strategy was not about compromising the Gospel but about removing barriers to its acceptance.<p><b>I have become all things to all people</b><br>Paul's flexibility in ministry is evident. He adapted his methods to connect with diverse groups, whether Jews, Gentiles, or those under the law (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20-21</a>). This adaptability is not about changing the message but about contextualizing it. It reflects the incarnation of Christ, who took on human form to reach humanity (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>).<p><b>so that by all possible means</b><br>Paul's commitment to the Gospel was comprehensive. He utilized every legitimate method to communicate the message of Christ. This phrase underscores the urgency and creativity in evangelism, reminiscent of Jesus' parables, which used everyday situations to convey spiritual truths (Matthew 13).<p><b>I might save some</b><br>Paul acknowledges that not everyone will accept the Gospel, but his efforts are directed toward saving as many as possible. This reflects the biblical understanding of human free will and divine sovereignty in salvation (<a href="/romans/9-18.htm">Romans 9:18-24</a>). It also highlights the importance of perseverance in ministry, as seen in Jesus' parable of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3-9</a>), where different responses to the Gospel are anticipated.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and epistles.

The whole passage treats of the attitude which the Apostle assumed towards various classes outside the Christian Church, that he might gain them as converts. The words "I became," which have introduced the various classes in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm" title="And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;">1Corinthians 9:20</a>, are here again repeated, and this passage seems to be an explanation and reiteration of what had gone before. "It was to the weak points (not to the strong points) of Jews, proselytes, and Gentiles that I assimilated myself. To the weak ones among all these classes I became weak, that I might gain those weak ones."<p><span class= "bld">I am made all things to all. . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">I am become all things to all men that I should save at least some.</span> Although he had thus accommodated himself, so far as was possible, consistently with Christian duty, to the weaknesses of all, he could only hope to win some of them. The natural climax would have been--"I become all things to all men that I might win <span class= "ital">all."</span> But the Apostle's humility could not let him dare to hope for so great a reward as that. All the self-sacrifice he could make was necessary to gain "at all events some," and that would be his ample reward. The word "save" means "win over to Christianity," as in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-16.htm" title="For what know you, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? or how know you, O man, whether you shall save your wife?">1Corinthians 7:16</a>, and is used here instead of the previous word "gain," being repeated to prevent any possible perversion of the Apostle's meaning as to "gaining men." His subject was not, as enemies might suggest, to win them to himself--but to Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the weak.</span> His whole argument here is a plea for condescension to the infirmities of weak converts. A similar condescension to their prejudices might be necessary to win them to Christianity at all (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-13.htm">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>; "We that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves," <a href="/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1</a>). St. Paul often touches on our duties to weak brethren (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>; <a href="/romans/14-1.htm">Romans 14:1</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>; <a href="/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All things to all men.</span> He repeats the same principle in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-33.htm">1 Corinthians 10:33</a>, "I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved;" and once more, at the end of his course (<a href="/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10</a>). This condescension laid him open to the malicious attacks of religious enemies (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). But not on that account would St. Paul ever be led to abandon the fruitful aid of that universal sympathy and tolerance which is one of the best tests of Christian love. <span class="cmt_word">That I might by all means save some.</span> He adds this explanation of the motive of his condescension to various scruples <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) lest any should accuse him of men pleasing, as some of his Galatian opponents had done (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). In his desire to win souls he acted with the wisdom and sympathy taught by experience, suppressing himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">To the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
