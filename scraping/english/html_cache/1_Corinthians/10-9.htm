In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul addresses the Corinthian church, cautioning them against behaviors that provoke God's judgment. The reference to "Christ" here emphasizes the continuity of God's nature and authority from the Old Testament to the New Testament. Testing God is a recurring theme in the Bible, seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/6-16.htm">Deuteronomy 6:16</a>, where the Israelites are warned not to test God as they did at Massah. This phrase underscores the importance of faith and obedience, reminding believers of the consequences of doubt and rebellion.<p><b>as some of them did</b><br>This refers to the Israelites during their wilderness journey, specifically recalling incidents where they tested God's patience through disobedience and lack of faith. The historical context is the period after the Exodus, where the Israelites frequently complained and doubted God's provision and protection. This serves as a cautionary tale for the Corinthians, drawing a parallel between the Israelites' experiences and the potential pitfalls facing the early Christian community. It highlights the importance of learning from past mistakes to avoid similar consequences.<p><b>and were killed by snakes</b><br>This alludes to the event recorded in <a href="/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4-9</a>, where the Israelites spoke against God and Moses, leading to God sending venomous snakes among them as a punishment. The geographical context is the desert region where the Israelites wandered, a harsh environment that tested their faith and reliance on God. Theologically, this incident serves as a type of Christ, as Moses was instructed to make a bronze serpent and lift it up so that those who looked upon it would be healed, prefiguring Christ's crucifixion (<a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>).

On the whole, the reading here adopted (the Lord) seems from internal evidence to have been most likely the true reading. It is possible that the word "God" crept into the text, having been put as a marginal explanation to get over the supposed difficulty involved in applying the words which follow, "they also tempted," to Christ. For in what sense could it have been said that the Israelites tempted Christ? There is no reason, however, for connecting "some of them tempted" (the word "also" is not in the original) with the object of the previous clause: and it is noticeable that the second word translated "tempted" is not the same as the first. "Let us not tempt" is in the original an intensified form of the verb which is used in its simple form in "some of them tempted." The reading "Christ" may have come into the text as being an explanation that by the word "Lord" St. Paul meant the Redeemer.<p>The real meaning of the passage, however, is evident. The Israelites had, by their longing after the things left behind in Egypt, tried God so that God had asserted Himself in visiting them with punishment, and so Christians must be on their guard, with such a warning before them, not to tempt their Lord by hankering after those worldly and physical pleasures from which He by His death has delivered them. (See <a href="/context/numbers/21-4.htm" title="And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.">Numbers 21:4-6</a>.) Some of the Corinthian Christians seemed by their conduct, as regards eating and drinking and indulging in sensuality, to long for that liberty in reference to things which they had enjoyed before conversion, instead of enjoying these spiritual blessings and feeding on the spiritual sustenance which Christ had provided for them.<p><span class= "bld">Were destroyed of serpents.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and were destroyed by the serpents.</span> The article before "serpents" indicates that the reference is to a particular and well known fact.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tempt Christ</span> (see the note on ver. 4). Christ is here identified with the angel which went before the Israelites, whom they were specially warned not "to provoke," because "my Name is in him" (<a href="/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20, 21</a>). Another reading is "the Lord." "Christ" may have come in from a marginal gloss. On the other hand, since "Christ" is the more difficult reading, it was, perhaps, the more likely to be altered by copyists.
