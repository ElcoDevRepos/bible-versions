Paul acknowledges their claim but seeks to correct their understanding. The context is the Corinthian church, which was influenced by Greek culture, known for its philosophical ideas about freedom and the body. The phrase may have been used to justify behaviors that were not in line with Christian teachings. Paul emphasizes that Christian freedom is not a license to sin. This echoes <a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>, where Paul warns against using freedom as an opportunity for the flesh.<p><b>but not everything is beneficial.</b><br>Paul introduces a principle of discernment, highlighting that not all permissible actions are beneficial. This aligns with the biblical teaching of seeking what is edifying and constructive (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23</a>). The focus is on the impact of actions on oneself and the community. The idea of benefit is tied to spiritual growth and the well-being of the church body. This principle is consistent with the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as Proverbs, which emphasizes the pursuit of what is good and wise.<p><b>&#8220;Everything is permissible for me,&#8221;</b><br>Paul repeats the phrase to emphasize the need for careful consideration of actions. The repetition serves as a rhetorical device to draw attention to the issue of Christian liberty. It reflects the tension between freedom in Christ and the responsibility that comes with it. This mirrors the teaching in <a href="/romans/14-14.htm">Romans 14:14-23</a>, where Paul discusses the importance of not causing others to stumble through one's exercise of freedom.<p><b>but I will not be mastered by anything.</b><br>Paul asserts the importance of self-control and mastery over one's desires. This is a call to avoid being enslaved by habits or behaviors that can dominate one's life. The concept of mastery is significant in the Greco-Roman world, where self-control was a valued virtue. Paul&#8217;s teaching here aligns with the fruit of the Spirit in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, which includes self-control. It also reflects Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a> about freedom from sin.

Christ grants genuine freedom, yet His Spirit asks two questions of every choice: Is it beneficial? Does it enslave? When actions pass both tests, freedom shines as God intended&#8212;serving others, strengthening us, and showcasing the beauty of the gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">All things are lawful unto me.</span>--This was probably a statement which the Apostle had himself made; at all events, the freedom which it expresses was very dear to him, and it may have been misused by some as an argument for universal license. St. Paul, therefore, boldly repeats it, and proceeds to show that it is a maxim of Christian liberty, which does not refer to matters which are absolutely wrong, and that even in its application to indifferent matters it must be limited, and guarded by other Christian principles. "The eating of things sacrificed to idols (see Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.">1Corinthians 8:4</a>), and the committing fornication," were two subjects of discussion closely connected with heathen worship; and it may seem astonishing to us now that because St. Paul had maintained the right of individual liberty concerning the former, he should perhaps have been quoted as an authority for liberty regarding the latter, yet it is a matter of fact that such a mode of reasoning was not uncommon. They were both regarded as part and parcel of heathen worship, and therefore, as it were, to stand or fall together, as being matters vital or indifferent. (See <a href="/acts/15-29.htm" title="That you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Fare you well.">Acts 15:29</a>, and <a href="/revelation/11-14.htm" title="The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe comes quickly.">Revelation 11:14</a>, as illustrations of the union of the two for purposes respectively of condemnation and of improper toleration.) We must not regard the use of the singular "me" as being in any sense a limitation of the principle to the Apostle personally. "Paul often speaks in the first person singular, which has the force of a moral maxim, especially in this Epistle (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.">1Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-7.htm" title="For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man has his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.">1Corinthians 7:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-13.htm" title="Why, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend.">1Corinthians 8:13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm" title="All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.">1Corinthians 10:23</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/10-29.htm" title="Conscience, I say, not your own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?">1Corinthians 10:29-30</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-11.htm" title="Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian to me.">1Corinthians 14:11</a>)" (Bengel). The words refer to all Christians. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-20.</span> - <span class="accented">The inexcusable sin and shame of fornication.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All things are lawful unto me.</span> The abruptness with which the phrase is introduced perhaps shows that, in the letter of the Corinthians to St. Paul, they had used some such expression by way of palliating their lax tolerance of violations of the law of purity. By "all things," of course, is only meant "all things which are indifferent in themselves." They erroneously applied this maxim of Christian liberty to that which was inherently sinful, and thus were tempted to "make their liberty a cloak of viciousness." St. Paul, as Bengel observes, often, and especially in this Epistle, uses the first person <span class="accented">generally</span> in gnomic or semi-proverbial sentences (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23, 29, 30</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-11.htm">1 Corinthians 14:11</a>). But. This is St. Paul's correction of too broad a formula. <span class="cmt_word">Are not expedient.</span> St. Paul illustrates this in <a href="/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8-10</a>. We have no right to do even that which is innocent, if it be disadvantageous to the highest interests of ourselves or others. "He alone," says St. Augustine, "does not fall into unlawful things who sometimes abstains by way of caution even from lawful ones." <span class="cmt_word">Will</span> <span class="cmt_word">not be brought under the power.</span> The play of words in the original might be imitated by saying, "All things are in my power, but I will not be brought under the power of any." In other words, "boundless intemperance" may become a tyranny. The pretence of moral freedom may end in a moral bondage. <p><span class="accented">"Obedience is better than freedom?
