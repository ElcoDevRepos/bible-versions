In the Greco-Roman world, such expressions were used to justify indulgence in physical appetites. The Corinthians, living in a city known for its moral laxity, might have used this logic to justify not only dietary choices but also sexual behaviors. The Apostle Paul challenges this mindset by pointing out that physical desires should not dictate moral behavior. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/15-17.htm">Matthew 15:17-20</a>, where He distinguishes between physical and spiritual defilement.<p><b>but God will destroy them both.</b><br>Paul reminds the Corinthians of the temporary nature of physical needs and desires. The ultimate destruction of both food and the stomach underscores the transient nature of earthly life and its pleasures. This aligns with the eschatological perspective found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10-13</a>, where the temporary nature of the world is highlighted. The focus is shifted from the temporal to the eternal, urging believers to prioritize spiritual over physical concerns.<p><b>The body is not intended for sexual immorality,</b><br>In a city like Corinth, known for its temple to Aphrodite and associated sexual immorality, this statement is a direct challenge to the prevailing cultural norms. Paul emphasizes that the body has a higher purpose than fulfilling carnal desires. This teaching is consistent with the biblical view of the body as a temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>), meant to honor God. The call to purity is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</a>, which instructs believers to abstain from sexual immorality.<p><b>but for the Lord,</b><br>Paul asserts that the body is meant to serve and glorify God. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where believers are called to honor God with their entire being. <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1-2</a> encourages believers to offer their bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God. The body, therefore, is not an instrument for sin but a vessel for worship and service to the Lord.<p><b>and the Lord for the body.</b><br>This phrase highlights the reciprocal relationship between the believer and Christ. The Lord's care and purpose for the body are evident in the resurrection, where believers are promised new, glorified bodies (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20-21</a>). This assurance of redemption and transformation underscores the value and dignity of the human body. It also points to the indwelling presence of Christ, who empowers believers to live in holiness and purity, as seen in <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, where Paul speaks of Christ living in him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance and correction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled early Christian community dealing with issues of immorality and misunderstanding of Christian freedom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece known for its wealth, commerce, and moral laxity, which influenced the behavior of the church members.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority and creator, who has a purpose for the human body beyond physical desires.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Jesus Christ)</a></b><br>Central to the Christian faith, emphasizing the sanctity and purpose of the body in relation to Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_christian_freedom.htm">Understanding Christian Freedom</a></b><br>While believers have freedom in Christ, it is not a license for immorality.

Lawful matters are to be decided upon the highest principle of expediency; but fornication is an unlawful matter, and therefore the question of its expediency does not arise at all. The stomach is adapted to the digestion of food, and food is adapted to it. This is, however, only for this life; both shall be destroyed by death. But the person ("body" being equivalent to "us" in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="And God has both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.">1Corinthians 6:14</a>) of the man is enduring. No food which enters defiles <span class= "ital">the man.</span> Fornication is not a mere transitory gratification; it affects <span class= "ital">the man.</span> The use of the stomach is to receive and digest food, and only the animal organisation is affected by that. It cannot be said that the man is made for fornication. The person of each is made for the Lord; the whole Church is His body; each baptised person is a limb of that body; and the Lord is for the body. He came to earth and died for it, and for each member of it; therefore what affects that body, or any member of that body (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> any Christian), cannot be an indifferent matter. Neither shall the man perish, as meats and the belly shall; he is immortal. (See <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1Corinthians 15:51-52</a>.) Such seems to be the argument by which St. Paul maintains liberty to be right regarding meats, and shows that the same principle does not apply to sensual indulgence. It may be put argumentatively thus:<p>1. Eating meats offered to idols is an "indifferent matter," because--<p>(<span class= "ital">a</span>) Meats only affect the particular organ designed for them;<p>(<span class= "ital">b</span>) Meats and that organ shall perish together.<p>2. Fornication is not an "indifferent matter," because--<p>(<span class= "ital">a</span>) It affects the man, and he is not designed for the purpose of this indulgence,<p>(<span class= "ital">b</span>) The man is immortal, and therefore the moral effect of the fornication on his nature does not perish at his death.<p><span class= "ital">Conclusion.</span>--Only indifferent matters are to be the subject of Christian liberty; and the decision must be according to the utility of each act. Fornication is not an indifferent matter; therefore it is not so to be decided upon. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Meats for the belly,</span> etc. The argument of the Corinthians about the indifference of eating "meats" which were merely ceremonially unclean was quite tenable. Things Levitically unclean might be essentially pure, and both food and the body which lives thereby are things "which perish in the using" (<a href="/colossians/2-22.htm">Colossians 2:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall destroy;</span> <span class="accented">shall bring to nought.</span> This would occur when the physical body becomes a spiritual body, like that of the angels of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51, 52</a>). How vile, then, is it to make a god of the belly - only to sleep and feed! <span class="cmt_word">Both it and them.</span> There shall be no need for <span class="accented">the belly</span> when men "shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more" (<a href="/revelation/7-16.htm">Revelation 7:16</a>); and the meat alluded to is "meat which perisheth" (<a href="/luke/15-16.htm">Luke 15:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now the body is net for fornication, but for the Lord.</span> The argument, therefore, which would class this sin as a matter of indifference, as was the Levitical distinction between different kinds of food, at once fell to the ground. Food was a necessity, and the stomach was formed for its assimilation. Fornication is not a venial but "a <span class="accented">deadly</span> sin." It is not a natural necessity, but a consuming evil. The body was created for higher ends - namely, to be a temple of God. "God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord for the body.</span> Therefore our members ought to be used "as instruments of righteousness unto God" (<a href="/romans/5-13.htm">Romans 5:13</a>), and our bodies presented as a living, holy, reasonable, acceptable sacrifice to him (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The end of our existence is "to serve God here and enjoy him forever hereafter." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Food</span><br /><span class="grk">&#946;&#961;&#974;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(br&#333;mata)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1033.htm">Strong's 1033: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food of any kind.
