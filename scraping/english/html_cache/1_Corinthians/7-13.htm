This situation reflects the cultural context of the Greco-Roman world, where religious beliefs within a household could vary. The Apostle Paul addresses this issue, acknowledging the reality of mixed-faith marriages. The emphasis here is on the woman's faith and her role within the marriage, highlighting the potential for her to influence her husband positively through her Christian conduct, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/3.htm">1 Peter 3:1-2</a>.<p><b>and he is willing to live with her</b><br>The willingness of the unbelieving husband to remain in the marriage is crucial. This phrase suggests a level of harmony and mutual respect within the relationship, despite differing beliefs. It reflects the principle of peace and coexistence, which Paul advocates in <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>, where believers are encouraged to live peaceably with all. The husband's willingness indicates an openness that could lead to his eventual conversion, aligning with the hope expressed in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-16.htm">1 Corinthians 7:16</a>.<p><b>she must not divorce him</b><br>Paul's instruction against divorce in this context underscores the sanctity and permanence of marriage, as established in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>. The directive aligns with Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>, where He emphasizes that what God has joined together, man should not separate. This command also reflects the broader biblical theme of reconciliation and unity, encouraging the believing spouse to maintain the marriage covenant and potentially lead the unbelieving partner to faith through their example and love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing issues within the Corinthian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and moral challenges, where the early church faced various issues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christian_wives.htm">Christian Wives</a></b><br>Believing women in the Corinthian church who are married to non-believing husbands.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/non-believing_husbands.htm">Non-believing Husbands</a></b><br>Husbands who do not share the Christian faith of their wives.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, dealing with questions about marriage and relationships.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sanctity_of_marriage.htm">Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is a covenant that should be honored, even when one spouse is not a believer.

This situation was common in the early church, where many came to Christ after marriage. Scripture never hides the reality that believers can find themselves unequally yoked (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>), yet it also shows that God can work powerfully through one faithful partner (<a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1&#8211;2</a>). The command assumes:<p>&#8226; The woman is already married.<p>&#8226; Her faith in Christ emerged after, or apart from, her husband&#8217;s.<p>&#8226; Her marriage covenant remains valid in God&#8217;s eyes (<a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he is willing to live with her</b><p>The next phrase introduces a condition: the unbelieving husband chooses to stay. Paul is addressing a peaceful, cooperative home life, even if spiritual unity is missing. Other verses echo the call to maintain peace where possible (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>) and show that mixed marriages can continue honorably (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm">1 Corinthians 7:12</a>). Key implications:<p>&#8226; The husband&#8217;s willingness is genuine&#8212;no coercion or danger involved.<p>&#8226; The believer&#8217;s witness can flourish in a respectful atmosphere (<a href="/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; If the unbeliever eventually walks away, a different instruction applies (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she must not divorce him</b><p>Here is the clear directive. Because marriage is covenantal, the believing wife is not to initiate a breakup simply on the grounds of her spouse&#8217;s unbelief. Paul roots this stance in God&#8217;s heart toward marriage (<a href="/malachi/2-16.htm">Malachi 2:16</a>) and Jesus&#8217; teaching that &#8220;what God has joined together, let man not separate&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>). Reasons behind the command include:<p>&#8226; The possibility of the husband&#8217;s salvation, as verse 16 suggests.<p>&#8226; The sanctifying influence the believer brings to the home (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-14.htm">1 Corinthians 7:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The testimony that faith in Christ strengthens rather than fractures family bonds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/7-13.htm">1 Corinthians 7:13</a> tells the Christian wife that if her unbelieving husband willingly stays, she is to remain married. God values the covenant, can bring spiritual benefit to the entire household through her faith, and may even draw the husband to salvation. Staying, not separating, best reflects God&#8217;s design and offers the greatest hope for everyone involved.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Let her not leave him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">let her not put him away;</span> the Greek being the same as is applied to the husband in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12</a>. Under Roman law--and St. Paul was writing to those who were under such law--the wife, as well as the husband, was permitted to obtain a divorce. It is therefore probable that St. Paul uses the stronger term here in reference to the woman's action in the matter, instead of repeating the same word as in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1Corinthians 7:10</a>. Some have suggested that the reason St. Paul applies this word to the action of the woman in the matter is that, in the case under consideration, the fact of the wife being a Christian inverts, in St. Paul's opinion, the natural order, and makes her the superior. This is wholly inadmissible, and quite contrary to St. Paul's view of the absolute superiority of the " husband.
