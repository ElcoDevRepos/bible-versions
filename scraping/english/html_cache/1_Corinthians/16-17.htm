Stephanas is mentioned earlier in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-16.htm">1 Corinthians 1:16</a> as one of the first converts in Achaia, suggesting his longstanding faith and leadership. Fortunatus and Achaicus are not mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament, but their inclusion here highlights their significance. The names suggest they may have been of Greek or Roman origin, reflecting the diverse cultural background of the Corinthian church. Their arrival likely brought news and support from Corinth, bridging the gap between Paul and the congregation.<p><b>because they have supplied what was lacking from you</b><br>This phrase suggests that the Corinthian church had certain deficiencies, possibly in spiritual encouragement or material support, which these men helped to fulfill. The term "supplied" implies a restoration or completion of what was missing, indicating their role in strengthening the bond between Paul and the Corinthians. This act of service aligns with the biblical principle of mutual support within the body of Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>, which encourages believers to bear one another's burdens. Their actions exemplify the Christian virtue of fellowship and the importance of personal presence in ministry, echoing the communal aspects of early Christian life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephanas.htm">Stephanas</a></b><br>A member of the Corinthian church, likely a leader or someone of significant influence. He is mentioned earlier in 1 Corinthians as one of the first converts in Achaia and is noted for his household's dedication to serving the saints.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/fortunatus.htm">Fortunatus</a></b><br>Another member of the Corinthian church who, along with Stephanas and Achaicus, visited Paul. His name suggests he may have been a freedman or someone of lower social status, yet he played a crucial role in supporting Paul.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/achaicus.htm">Achaicus</a></b><br>A fellow Corinthian who accompanied Stephanas and Fortunatus. His name indicates he was likely from the region of Achaia, which includes Corinth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and moral challenges. The church in Corinth faced many issues, which Paul addresses in his letters.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul's_ministry.htm">Paul's Ministry</a></b><br>The apostle Paul, who wrote 1 Corinthians, was deeply invested in the spiritual growth and correction of the Corinthian church. His letters often addressed doctrinal issues and practical living.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_fellowship_and_support.htm">The Importance of Fellowship and Support</a></b><br>The arrival of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus highlights the importance of fellowship and mutual support among believers.

His joy is genuine, grounded in fellowship believers share in Christ (see <a href="/2_john/1-12.htm">2 John 1:12</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly underscores that Christian relationships are a source of God-given encouragement&#8212;&#8220;refresh my heart in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/philemon/1-20.htm">Philemon 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; By stating his gladness up front, Paul models gratitude, echoing &#8220;Rejoice always&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:16</a>). He shows us that noticing God&#8217;s blessings in people is part of faithful living.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have arrived</b><p>&#8226; These three men were likely members of the household of Stephanas, &#8220;the firstfruits of Achaia&#8221; (1 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 16</a>:15).<p>&#8226; Their arrival bridges physical distance; believers remain one body even when separated (<a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; God often works through specific individuals to meet needs: Titus brought comfort to Paul (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6</a>), Epaphroditus carried aid from Philippi (<a href="/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Their names being recorded affirms Christ&#8217;s care for each servant; &#8220;He calls his own sheep by name&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>). Faithful service is never anonymous in heaven.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because they have supplied</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Supplied&#8221; points to tangible ministry&#8212;filling a gap much like the Macedonians&#8217; generosity &#8220;supplied my needs&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>).<p>&#8226; God equips certain believers to step into practical roles (<a href="/romans/12-7.htm">Romans 12:7&#8211;8</a>). Service is an act of worship, pleasing to God (<a href="/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The language carries the idea of completing what was missing, reminding us that Christ&#8217;s church functions as interdependent members (1 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 12</a>:21).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s transparency keeps the focus on God&#8217;s provision, not human deficiency.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what was lacking from you</b><p>&#8226; The Corinthian church desired to help but circumstances hindered them. God sovereignly used these three to make up &#8220;what was lacking.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Similar wording appears in <a href="/philippians/2-30.htm">Philippians 2:30</a>, where Epaphroditus &#8220;risked his life to make up for your deficit in my service.&#8221; Scripture teaches that when one part cannot act, another steps in (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-14.htm">2 Corinthians 8:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; This phrase is not a rebuke but an affirmation that God&#8217;s plan includes different roles at different times (<a href="/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; It highlights stewardship: every believer has a share in meeting needs (<a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>). No congregation can do everything, yet together the body of Christ lacks nothing (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s glad thanksgiving in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-17.htm">1 Corinthians 16:17</a> celebrates how God used Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus to bridge a gap the Corinthians could not fill themselves. Their arrival refreshed Paul, demonstrated the unity of Christ&#8217;s body, and showcased God&#8217;s faithful provision through willing servants. The verse calls believers today to notice needs, step in when prompted, and rejoice that the Lord perfectly supplies whatever is lacking among His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of the coming;</span> rather, <span class="accented">at the presence of.</span> They were now with St. Paul in Ephesus. <span class="cmt_word">Fortunatus.</span> A Christian of this name also carried the letter of St. Clement to Corinth. <span class="cmt_word">That which was lacking on your part.</span> This sounds like a reproach in the Authorized Version, but is quite the reverse.
