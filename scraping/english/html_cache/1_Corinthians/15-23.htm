The concept of order is significant in biblical theology, reflecting God's structured plan for salvation history. The idea of "turn" suggests a predetermined sequence, aligning with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and divine timing. This order is also seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven.<p><b>Christ the firstfruits:</b><br>The term "firstfruits" is deeply rooted in Old Testament practices, where the first portion of the harvest was offered to God as a sign of trust and gratitude (<a href="/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10-11</a>). In the New Testament, Christ as the "firstfruits" signifies His resurrection as the first of its kind, guaranteeing the future resurrection of believers. This typology connects to the Feast of Firstfruits, which foreshadows Christ's resurrection, occurring shortly after Passover, symbolizing new life and hope.<p><b>then at His coming,</b><br>This phrase refers to the second coming of Christ, a central tenet of Christian eschatology. The anticipation of Christ's return is a recurring theme throughout the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a> and <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>. The term "coming" (Greek: parousia) implies not just arrival but also presence, emphasizing the transformative impact of Christ's return on the world and His followers.<p><b>those who belong to Him:</b><br>This phrase identifies the group of people who will be resurrected at Christ's coming&#8212;believers who are united with Him through faith. The concept of belonging to Christ is foundational in Christian identity, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>. It underscores the intimate relationship between Christ and His followers, who are described as His body, bride, and flock, highlighting themes of covenant and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, referred to as the "firstfruits" in this passage, indicating His resurrection as the first of its kind, guaranteeing the future resurrection of believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/firstfruits.htm">Firstfruits</a></b><br>A term rooted in Jewish agricultural practice, where the first portion of the harvest was offered to God.
