In the early Christian context, the church was often a small group meeting in homes. The focus is on communal worship and the edification of the body, emphasizing the importance of mutual understanding and instruction within the community of believers.<p><b>I would rather speak five coherent words</b><br>Paul emphasizes the value of clarity and understanding in communication. The number "five" is symbolic of simplicity and sufficiency, contrasting with the excessive and potentially confusing use of tongues. This reflects the principle that effective communication in the church should be clear and edifying, aligning with the broader biblical theme of wisdom and understanding (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>).<p><b>to instruct others</b><br>The purpose of speaking in the church is to instruct and edify others, highlighting the importance of teaching and discipleship. This aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His followers to teach others. The focus is on building up the body of Christ through clear and understandable teaching.<p><b>than ten thousand words in a tongue</b><br>The hyperbolic contrast between "five" and "ten thousand" underscores the futility of speaking in tongues without interpretation. In the cultural context of Corinth, where spiritual gifts were highly valued, Paul redirects the focus from personal edification to communal benefit. This echoes the teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12-14</a>, where Paul discusses the proper use of spiritual gifts for the common good.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.
