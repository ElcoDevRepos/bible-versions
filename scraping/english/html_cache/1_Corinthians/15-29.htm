Paul is addressing doubts about the resurrection, emphasizing its foundational importance to Christian faith. The resurrection is a core doctrine, as seen in earlier verses where Paul outlines the gospel message (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>).<p><b>what will those do who are baptized for the dead?</b><br>This phrase has been the subject of much debate. In the historical context, some early Christians may have practiced a form of proxy baptism, possibly influenced by local customs or misunderstandings. However, there is no direct biblical endorsement of this practice. Theologically, Paul might be using this as a rhetorical device to highlight the inconsistency of denying the resurrection while engaging in practices that imply belief in life after death.<p><b>If the dead are not raised at all,</b><br>Paul reiterates the central argument of the chapter: the resurrection is essential to Christian hope. Without it, the faith is in vain (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>). This statement underscores the eschatological promise found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> and <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>, where resurrection is linked to eternal life.<p><b>why are people baptized for them?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the logic of those who deny the resurrection. Baptism symbolizes death, burial, and resurrection with Christ (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>). If there is no resurrection, the symbolism and hope associated with baptism are rendered meaningless. Paul uses this argument to affirm the reality and necessity of the resurrection, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of redemption and eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth about the resurrection of the dead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and various religious practices, including some that may have influenced the Corinthian church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, struggling with various theological and moral issues, including misunderstandings about the resurrection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dead.htm">The Dead</a></b><br>Refers to those who have died, central to the discussion of resurrection in this chapter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/baptism.htm">Baptism</a></b><br>A Christian sacrament of initiation and purification, symbolizing the believer's faith in Christ's death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_context.htm">Understanding Context</a></b><br>Recognize that <a href="/1_corinthians/15-29.htm">1 Corinthians 15:29</a> is part of a larger argument about the resurrection.

So he now adds another &#8220;if.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Without a literal resurrection every earlier statement crumbles: preaching is empty (15:14), faith is futile (15:17), and believers who have &#8220;fallen asleep in Christ have perished&#8221; (15:18).<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a> shows that Paul&#8217;s entire ministry rested on &#8220;the hope of the resurrection of the dead.&#8221; If that hope is false, why keep preaching or suffering (15:30-32)?<p>With this groundwork, he turns to a practice familiar to the Corinthian church to expose the absurdity of denying resurrection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what will those do who are baptized for the dead?</b><p>The simplest reading is &#8220;baptized on account of the dead.&#8221; People were coming to faith and entering the waters because the deaths of believers&#8212;often martyrs&#8212;had testified powerfully that Jesus truly lives.<p>&#8226; New converts were stirred by the steadfast hope they saw in dying saints; their own baptism declared, &#8220;I want what they had&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a> ties baptism directly to death and resurrection with Christ.

If there is no future raising of the dead, baptism is pointless, preaching is worthless, faith is futile, and the witness of those who died in Christ is a sham. But because Christ truly rose, believers keep declaring that reality in the waters of baptism, confident that the dead in Christ will rise first and we will all be &#8220;swallowed up by life&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Else.</span>--We can well imagine the Apostle pausing, as it were, to take breath after the splendid outburst of mingled rhetoric and logic which we find in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-23.htm" title="But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.">1Corinthians 15:23-28</a>; or perhaps even postponing until some other day the further dictation of his Epistle, when he could calmly resume his purely logical argument in favour of the doctrine of the Resurrection. Then there will not appear such a startling or inexplicable abruptness in the words with which this new argument is commenced. "Else"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> if there be no resurrection--<span class= "ital">what shall they who are baptised for the dead do? If the dead be not raised at all, why are they then baptised for the dead?</span> Such is the proper punctuation, and not as in the English version, which joins the clause, "if the dead rise not," with the preceding instead of with the following portion of the verse. Also the word translated "rise," is "are raised." This is an <span class= "ital">argumentum ad hominem.</span> The practice known as baptism for the dead was absurd if there be no resurrection. To practise it and to deny the doctrine of the resurrection was illogical. What shall they do?<span class= "ital"> i.e.,</span> What explanation shall they give of their conduct? asks the Apostle. There have been numerous and ingenious conjectures as to the meaning of this passage. The only tenable interpretation is that there existed amongst some of the Christians at Corinth a practice of baptising a living person in the stead of some convert who had died before that sacrament had been administered to him. Such a practice existed amongst the Marcionites in the second century, and still earlier amongst a sect called the Corinthians. The idea evidently was that whatever benefit flowed from baptism might be thus vicariously secured for the deceased Christian. St. Chrysostom gives the following description of it:--"After a catechumen (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> one prepared for baptism, but not actually baptised) was dead, they hid a living man under the bed of the deceased; then coming to the bed of the dead man they spake to him, and asked whether he would receive baptism, and he making no answer, the other replied in his stead, and so they baptised the 'living for the dead.'" Does St. Paul then, by what he here says, sanction the superstitious practice? Certainly not. He carefully separates himself and the Corinthians, to whom he immediately addresses himself, from those who adopted this custom. He no longer uses the first or second person; it is "they" throughout this passage. It is no proof to others; it is simply the <span class= "ital">argumentum ad hominem.</span> Those who do that, and disbelieve a resurrection, refute themselves. This custom possibly sprang up amongst the Jewish converts, who had been accustomed to something similar in their own faith. If a Jew died without having been purified from some ceremonial uncleanness, some living person had the necessary ablution performed on them, and the dead were so accounted clean.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-34.</span> - <span class="accented">Arguments from the practices and lives of Christians.</span> The three arguments used in these verses are: If there be no resurrection: <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Why do some of you get yourselves baptized on behalf of your dead friends? <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Why do we face lives of daily peril? <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> How would it be otherwise possible to resist Epicurean views of life? <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead,</span> etc.? This clause can have but one meaning, and that its obvious one, namely, that, among the many strange opinions and practices which then prevailed, was one which was entirely un-warranted-but which St. Paul does not here stop to examine - of persons getting themselves baptized as it were by <span class="accented">proxy</span> for others who had died. Doubtless some of the deaths alluded to in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a> had happened to persons who had been cut off before they were actually baptized; and their friends had as it were gone through the rite <span class="accented">in their stead</span>, in the hope of extending to them some of its benefits. It is argued that St. Paul could not possibly mention such a practice without reprobation; but that is an <span class="accented">a priori</span> assumption not warranted by St. Paul's methods (see <a href="/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-6.htm">1 Corinthians 11:6</a>). He always confines his attention to the question immediately before him, and his present object is merely to urge a passing <span class="accented">argumentum ad hominem.</span> There is nothing at all surprising in the existence of such an abuse in the medley of wild opinions and wild practices observable in this disorganized Church. It accords with the known tendency of later times to postpone baptism, as a rite which was supposed to work as a charm. We also find that the actual practice of baptism on behalf of the dead lingered on among Corinthians (Epiph., 'Haer.,' 28:7) and Marcionites (Tertullian, 'De Resurrect.,' 48; 'Adv. Marc.,' 5:10). Tertullian accepts the words in their obvious sense in his 'De Praeser. Haer.,' 48, but accepts the absurdity of "the dead" meaning "the body" ("pro mortuis tingui est pro corporibus tingui") in his book against Marcion (5:10). St. Chrysostom tells us further that the proxy who was to be baptized used to be concealed under the bier of the dead man, who was supposed to answer in his name that he desired to be baptized. How perfectly natural the custom was may be seen from the fact that among the Jews also a man dying under ceremonial pollution was cleansed by proxy. The "interpretations" of this verse are so numerous that it is not even possible to give a catalogue of them. Many of them are not worth recording, and are only worth alluding to at all as specimens of the wilful bias which goes to Scripture, not to seek truth, but to support tradition. They are mostly futile and fantastic, because they pervert the plain meaning of the plain words. It is a waste of time and space to give perpetuity to baseless fancies. Such are the notions that "for the dead" can mean "for our mortal bodies" (Chrysostom); or "for those about to die" (Estius, Calvin, etc.); or "over (the sepulchres of) the dead" (Luther); or "to supply the vacancies left by the dead" (Le Clerc, etc.). Equally unwarrantable are the "explanations" (?) which make those who are being "baptized" mean those who are "passing through a baptism of suffering" (!). Not a single argument which is worth a moment's consideration can be urged in favour of any one of these, or scores of similar views. If we are to get rid of everything that is surprising on the ground that it is "immensely improbable," we may as well discard Scripture at once, and reconstruct early Christian history out of our own consciousness. It has been very usual to represent it as we think that it ought to have been, and not as it was. The disuse of this vicarious baptism among orthodox Christians may have been due to the discouragement of it by St. Paul when he went to Corinth, and "set in order" various erroneous customs (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-34.htm">1 Corinthians 11:34</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/15-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If [these things are] not so,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#960;&#949;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Epei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1893.htm">Strong's 1893: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of time: when, after; of cause: since, because; otherwise: else.
