In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul emphasizes the simplicity and purity of the Gospel message, contrasting it with the complex rhetoric and philosophy valued by Greek culture. This reflects Paul's commitment to focusing on Christ crucified (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>) rather than human wisdom.<p><b>were not with persuasive words of wisdom</b><br>Paul deliberately avoided using the sophisticated rhetoric and eloquence that were highly esteemed in Corinthian society. The Greeks valued oratory skills and philosophical arguments, but Paul chose not to rely on these to convey the Gospel. This approach aligns with his earlier statement in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>, where he emphasizes that the cross of Christ should not be emptied of its power by human wisdom.<p><b>but with a demonstration of the Spirit&#8217;s power</b><br>The demonstration of the Spirit's power refers to the tangible evidence of the Holy Spirit's work among the Corinthians, which could include miracles, spiritual gifts, and transformed lives. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that true faith and conversion are the result of the Holy Spirit's work, not human persuasion (<a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8-11</a>). The power of the Spirit is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where He assures His disciples that they will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, emphasizing the power of the Holy Spirit over human wisdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece known for its wealth and diversity, but also for its moral and spiritual challenges.

This simplicity was the more remarkable because "Corinthian words" was a proverb for choice, elaborate, and glittering phrases (Wetstein). It is not improbable that the almost total and deeply discouraging want of success of St. Paul in preaching at Athens had impressed him mere strongly with the uselessness of attempting to fight Greek philosophers with their own blunt and imperfect weapons. <span class="cmt_word">In demonstration of the Spirit and of power</span>. So he says to the Thessalonians," Our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance." The plain facts, so repellent to the natural intellect, were driven home with matchless force by spiritual conviction. The only heathen critic who has mentioned St. Paul's method is Longinus, the author of the treatise on 'The Sublime and Beautiful,' who calls him "a master of unproved dogma," meaning apparently that his force lay in the irresistible statement of the facts which he came to preach. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">My</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(mou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
