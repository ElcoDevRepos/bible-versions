The Father is recognized as the source of all creation, aligning with Old Testament affirmations of God's singularity (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). This underscores the intimate relationship believers have with God, who is not a distant deity but a personal Father.<p><b>from whom all things came</b><br>This highlights God's role as the Creator, echoing <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God is the origin of the universe. It affirms the belief that everything in existence is a result of God's creative power, reinforcing His sovereignty and authority over all creation. This also serves as a reminder of God's providence and the order He established in the world.<p><b>and for whom we exist</b><br>This phrase speaks to the purpose of human life, which is to glorify and serve God. It reflects the teaching found in <a href="/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>, where God declares that He created people for His glory. This purpose provides meaning and direction for believers, emphasizing that their lives are to be lived in devotion to God.<p><b>And there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to the centrality of Jesus Christ in Christian faith. The term "Lord" signifies authority and divinity, affirming Jesus' role as the Messiah and His equality with God the Father. This is consistent with <a href="/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>, where every tongue confesses Jesus Christ as Lord. It also reflects the early Christian confession of faith and distinguishes Jesus from other so-called lords or deities.<p><b>through whom all things came</b><br>This phrase attributes the act of creation to Jesus, aligning with <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>, which states that all things were made through Him. It affirms the pre-existence of Christ and His active participation in creation, highlighting the unity and cooperation within the Trinity. This counters any notion that Jesus is a created being, instead affirming His divine nature.<p><b>and through whom we exist</b><br>This emphasizes the sustaining power of Christ in the lives of believers. <a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a> states that in Him all things hold together, indicating that Jesus is not only the agent of creation but also the one who maintains the existence of all things. For believers, this means that their spiritual life and salvation are dependent on Christ, reinforcing the necessity of a personal relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The supreme being, creator of all things, and the one for whom we exist.

The words "we by Him" must not be regarded as a repetition of part of the thought of the previous sentence; but as the words "by whom are all things" express the fact of physical creation, so the words, "we by Him," attribute our spiritual re-creation as Christians to the same source. (See <a href="/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm" title="For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.">Ephesians 2:10</a>.) This sixth verse then sweeps away completely any pantheistic conception which might have been thought to be in the previous words.
