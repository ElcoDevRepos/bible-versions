The resurrection is a historical event that is foundational to Christian doctrine, as it validates Jesus' divinity and the truth of His teachings. The resurrection is mentioned in all four Gospels and is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>. The resurrection is also a demonstration of God's power over death, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9</a>, which states that death no longer has dominion over Him. The phrase "has indeed been raised" emphasizes the certainty and reality of this event, countering any claims that it was metaphorical or spiritual rather than physical.<p><b>the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep</b><br>The term "firstfruits" is a reference to the Old Testament practice of offering the first portion of the harvest to God, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10-11</a>. This offering was a sign of the full harvest to come and a pledge of the future abundance. In calling Christ the "firstfruits," Paul is indicating that Jesus' resurrection is the first of many, guaranteeing the future resurrection of all believers. The phrase "those who have fallen asleep" is a euphemism for death, used to convey the temporary nature of death for believers, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-14</a>. This imagery reassures Christians that, just as Christ was raised, so too will they be raised to eternal life, as promised in <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, whose resurrection is the cornerstone of Christian faith.
