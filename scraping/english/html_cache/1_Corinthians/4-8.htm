In the context of Corinth, a wealthy and cosmopolitan city, the believers may have been influenced by the surrounding culture's emphasis on material wealth and social status. This phrase suggests a spiritual complacency, as they believed they had reached a level of spiritual maturity and fulfillment. The Corinthian church was known for its divisions and pride, as seen in earlier chapters, and Paul challenges their perception of spiritual sufficiency.<p><b>Already you have become rich.</b><br>This statement continues the ironic tone, as Paul contrasts the Corinthians' perceived spiritual richness with their actual spiritual immaturity. The church in Corinth was materially prosperous, but Paul implies that their spiritual wealth is lacking. This echoes Jesus' teachings in <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>, where the church in Laodicea is described as thinking they are rich, yet they are spiritually poor. The Corinthians' focus on earthly riches and wisdom detracted from their understanding of true spiritual riches found in Christ.<p><b>Without us, you have become kings.</b><br>Paul uses hyperbole to emphasize the Corinthians' inflated self-view. The phrase suggests that they believed they had achieved a level of spiritual authority and reign without the foundational apostles like Paul. This reflects a misunderstanding of the nature of the Kingdom of God, which is not yet fully realized on earth. The Corinthians' attitude contrasts with the humility and servanthood exemplified by Christ and His apostles. This also connects to the eschatological hope of reigning with Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>, but Paul implies that this reign is premature.<p><b>How I wish you really were kings,</b><br>Paul expresses a longing for the Corinthians to truly embody the spiritual maturity and authority they claim. This wish reflects the apostolic desire for the church to grow in genuine spiritual wisdom and understanding. It also points to the future hope of believers reigning with Christ in His Kingdom, as seen in <a href="/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>. Paul's statement underscores the gap between the Corinthians' current state and their potential in Christ.<p><b>so that we might be kings with you!</b><br>Paul concludes with a reminder of the communal aspect of the Christian faith. The apostles and the church are meant to share in the future reign with Christ, highlighting the unity and equality of all believers in the body of Christ. This phrase emphasizes the interconnectedness of the church and the apostles, countering the divisions and pride present in Corinth. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's Kingdom, where all believers will share in the glory and reign of Christ, as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/7-27.htm">Daniel 7:27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the Corinthian church with a tone of irony and correction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, known for their spiritual gifts but also for their pride and divisions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and moral challenges, which influenced the church's behavior.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostolic_leadership.htm">Apostolic Leadership</a></b><br>Paul references himself and other apostles, contrasting their humble state with the Corinthians' perceived self-sufficiency.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/reigning_as_kings.htm">Reigning as Kings</a></b><br>A metaphor used by Paul to highlight the Corinthians' premature sense of spiritual fulfillment and authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_humility.htm">Spiritual Humility</a></b><br>Recognize the danger of spiritual pride and self-sufficiency.

His irony confronts complacency, yet his longing affirms the coming reality of shared reign with Christ. Present contentment must never eclipse dependence on the Lord or readiness to endure for His sake, because the true coronation awaits Christ&#8217;s return, when all faithful believers will reign together with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Now ye are full.</span>--These three following sentences are ironical. The emphasis is on the word "now." Ye are already (as distinct from us Apostles) full, rich, kings. You act as if you had already attained the crowning point in the Christian course. "Piety is an insatiable thing," says Chrysostom on this passage, "and it argues a childish mind to imagine from just the beginnings that you have attained the whole; and for men who are not even yet in the prelude of a matter to be highminded, as if they had laid hold of the end."<p><span class= "bld">Without us.</span>--The Apostle would have his converts be to him as his crown of rejoicing; but they now assume to have "come into the kingdom" without any connection with him who had won them to God.<p><span class= "bld">And I would to</span> <span class= "bld">God.</span>--Here the irony is dropped, and these words are written with intense feeling and humility. The Apostle, reminded, as it were, by the word "reign," that the time will come when the war and controversies of the Church militant shall end, expresses his deep longing for that blessed change. (See <a href="/1_corinthians/3-22.htm" title="Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;">1Corinthians 3:22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-23.htm" title="And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.">1Corinthians 9:23</a>, where similarly the Apostle shows that in rebuking the folly of the Corinthian Church he does not under-estimate their privileges.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now ye are full, now ye are rich;</span> rather, <span class="accented">already ye have been sated, already ye grew rich.</span> There is a strong but healing irony in these expressions, and in the entire contrast between the comfortable, full fed, regal self satisfaction of the Corinthians, and the depression and scorn in the midst of which the apostles lived. The loving delicate irony is, in a different way, as effective as the stern denunciation of St. John: "Thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked" (<a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>). St. Paul's satire is always akin to charity; it is never satire with no pity in it. <span class="cmt_word">Ye have reigned as kings</span>. The word simply means "ye reigned." Like the Stoics, so each little Corinthian sectarian regarded himself as a king. "To reign" was, however, a proverbial phrase (like the Latin <span class="accented">vivo et regno</span>) for being "happy as a king." <span class="cmt_word">Without us</span> (comp. <a href="/hebrews/11-40.htm">Hebrews 11:40</a>). The Corinthians were cultivated enough to appreciate the deep irony of the phrase, "We poor apostles have become quite needless to you in your lordly independence." <span class="cmt_word">And I would to God ye did reign</span>. The words "to God" should be omitted. The loving heart of St. Paul could never long keep up a strain of irony.
