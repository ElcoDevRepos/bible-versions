Paul reminds them that the gospel did not begin with them; it originated with God and was delivered through the apostles. This echoes the broader biblical narrative that God's revelation is not confined to a single group or location. Historically, the early church was diverse, with the gospel spreading from Jerusalem to Judea, Samaria, and beyond (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). This phrase underscores the humility required in receiving and sharing God's word, aligning with the broader biblical teaching that no one group holds exclusive rights to divine revelation.<p><b>Or are you the only ones it has reached?</b><br>Paul continues his rhetorical questioning to emphasize the universality of the gospel message. The Corinthian church is reminded that they are part of a larger body of believers. This phrase highlights the interconnectedness of the early Christian communities, as seen in Paul's letters to various churches. It also reflects the cultural context of the time, where communication and travel were increasing, allowing for the spread of ideas and beliefs. Theologically, this connects to the concept of the church as the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>), where each member is vital but not isolated. This phrase serves as a corrective against any exclusivist attitudes, reminding believers of their shared faith and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostle_paul.htm">Apostle Paul</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with authority and pastoral concern.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and cultural influences, which affected the church's practices and beliefs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, struggling with issues of order and propriety in worship, including the use of spiritual gifts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_origin_of_scripture.htm">Divine Origin of Scripture</a></b><br>The Word of God does not originate from human sources but is divinely inspired.
