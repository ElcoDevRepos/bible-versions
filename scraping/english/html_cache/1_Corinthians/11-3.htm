This introduction emphasizes the importance of the teaching that follows, suggesting that it is foundational for the proper functioning of relationships within the church. The phrase indicates Paul's role as a teacher and apostle, guiding the early church in doctrinal truths.<p><b>that the head of every man is Christ</b><br>In this context, "head" signifies authority and leadership. Christ's headship over every man underscores His role as the ultimate authority and leader of the church. This reflects the biblical teaching of Christ as the head of the body, the church (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>). It also aligns with the concept of Christ as the mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>), emphasizing His divine authority and leadership.<p><b>and the head of the woman is man</b><br>This phrase reflects the order of creation as described in Genesis, where man was created first and woman was created as a helper suitable for him (<a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18-23</a>). In the cultural context of the time, this headship was understood as a leadership role within the family and the church. It is important to note that this does not imply inequality but rather a difference in roles and responsibilities, as both men and women are equal in value before God (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>and the head of Christ is God</b><br>This statement highlights the relationship within the Trinity, where Christ, though equal with God, submits to the Father. This submission is seen in Christ's incarnation and His obedience to the Father's will (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>). It serves as a model for the relationships described earlier in the verse, illustrating that authority and submission can coexist with equality and unity. This reflects the divine order and harmony within the Godhead, providing a pattern for human relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with teachings and instructions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ (Jesus Christ)</a></b><br>The Son of God, who is the head of every man, representing divine authority and leadership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/man.htm">Man</a></b><br>Refers to males in the context of the family and church, under the headship of Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/woman.htm">Woman</a></b><br>Refers to females, particularly in the context of marriage and church, under the headship of man.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Father, who is the head of Christ, establishing a divine order and hierarchy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_order.htm">Understanding Divine Order</a></b><br>Recognize the biblical structure of authority as established by God, with Christ as the head of man, man as the head of woman, and God as the head of Christ.

The subject treated of, viz., the uncovering of their heads by women in assemblies for worship, was of ephemeral moment, and as we all now would regard it, of trivial importance. Every circumstance, however, which could in the least degree cause the principles of Christianity to be perverted or misunderstood by the heathen world was of vital importance in those early days of the Church, and hence we find the Apostle, who most fearlessly taught the principles of Christian liberty, condemning most earnestly every application of those principles which might be detrimental to the best interests of the Christian faith. To feel bound to assert your liberty in every detail of social and political life is to cease to be free--the very liberty becomes a bondage.<p><span class= "bld">The head of every man is Christ.</span>--The Apostle does not merely treat of the outward practice on which his advice has been sought, but proceeds to lay down the principles which are opposed to the principle of that absolute and essential equality, which, found its expression and assertion in the practice of women uncovering their heads in public assemblies.<p>The allusion here is not to Christ as the Head of the whole human race and of all things (as in <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>), but as the Head of "the Body," the Christian Church: and this thought introduces the general argument regarding the practical subordination of woman, by reminding the Corinthians that though there is in the Church a perfect spiritual equality (as taught in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm" title="There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:28</a>), yet that it is an equality which is of order and not of disorder--that it is an equality which can only be preserved by remembering that each is not an isolated irresponsible atom, but a part of an organic whole. There is a Head to the Church, therefore it is not a machine composed of various parts, but a body consisting of various members. As there is a subordination of the whole body to Christ, so there is in that body a subordination of woman to man. The last clause, "the Head of Christ is God," gives (as is St. Paul's custom, see <a href="/1_corinthians/3-23.htm" title="And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.">1Corinthians 3:23</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.">1Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1Corinthians 15:25</a>) completeness to the thought. As the Head of the Church--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> as the man Christ Jesus--Christ is subordinate to the Father, and, indeed, perhaps the idea is carried farther into the mystery of the divine nature itself, as consisting of three Persons co-eternal and co-equal, yet being designated with an unvarying sequence as "first," and "second," and "third." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I would have you know;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but I wish you to know.<span class="cmt_word"></span> That the head of every man is Christ.</span> St. Paul, as was customary with him, applies the loftiest principles to the solution of the humblest difficulties. Given a question as to what is right or wrong in a particular instance, he always aims at laying down some great eternal fact to which the duty or decision is ultimately referable, and deduces the required rule from that fact. The headship of Christ is stated in <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>; and its application to the superiority of man is laid down also in <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>. The subordinate position of the woman is also stated in <a href="/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11, 12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1, 5, 6</a>, etc. This, however, is merely an ordinance of earthly application.
