In the early church, speaking in tongues was a sign of the Holy Spirit's presence and power. However, Paul emphasizes the importance of intelligibility in worship. The "blessing in spirit" refers to a prayer or praise offered in a language unknown to the congregation. This practice, while spiritually edifying for the speaker, may not benefit others unless interpreted (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-13.htm">1 Corinthians 14:13</a>). The emphasis is on edification of the church body, aligning with Paul's broader teaching on spiritual gifts being used for the common good (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>).<p><b>how can someone who is uninstructed say &#8220;Amen&#8221; to your thanksgiving</b><br>The term "uninstructed" refers to those who are not familiar with the practice of speaking in tongues or who are new to the faith. In Jewish and early Christian worship, saying "Amen" was a way for the congregation to agree with and affirm a prayer or statement (<a href="/nehemiah/8-6.htm">Nehemiah 8:6</a>). If the words spoken are not understood, the uninstructed cannot participate fully in the worship experience. This highlights the communal aspect of worship, where understanding and mutual edification are prioritized (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>).<p><b>since he does not know what you are saying?</b><br>Understanding is crucial for participation in worship. Paul stresses that spiritual gifts should be exercised in a way that builds up the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-12.htm">1 Corinthians 14:12</a>). The lack of understanding creates a barrier to communal worship and fellowship. This concern for clarity and edification is consistent with Paul's teachings elsewhere, such as in <a href="/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a>, where he encourages believers to pursue what leads to peace and mutual edification. The emphasis is on love and consideration for others, reflecting the character of Christ, who sought to include and uplift all believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth regarding the use of spiritual gifts, particularly speaking in tongues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and spiritually gifted congregation facing issues of order and understanding in worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/ungifted_person.htm">Ungifted Person</a></b><br>Refers to someone who does not possess the gift of interpretation or understanding of tongues, thus unable to participate fully in the worship experience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/speaking_in_spirit.htm">Speaking in Spirit</a></b><br>The act of speaking in tongues, a spiritual gift that requires interpretation for communal edification.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/amen.htm">Amen</a></b><br>A Hebrew word meaning "truly" or "so be it," used to express agreement or affirmation in a communal setting.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_edification.htm">The Importance of Edification</a></b><br>Spiritual gifts, including speaking in tongues, should be used for the edification of the church.
