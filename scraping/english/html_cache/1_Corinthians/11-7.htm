In Jewish tradition, men often covered their heads as a sign of reverence. However, Paul is addressing a different cultural practice in Corinth, where men were expected to pray and prophesy with uncovered heads to reflect their direct relationship with God. This practice symbolized the man's role as the head of the family and the church, aligning with the order of creation as described in <a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-27</a>, where man is created in the image of God.<p><b>since he is the image and glory of God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the theological concept that man was created in the image of God, as stated in <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>. The term "glory" here refers to the reflection of God's attributes and authority. Man, being created first, is seen as a direct representation of God's dominion and creative power. This reflects the order and purpose in creation, where man is given the responsibility to steward and lead, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15-20</a>.<p><b>but the woman is the glory of man</b><br>The phrase highlights the complementary role of women in creation. According to <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18-23</a>, woman was created from man to be a suitable helper, reflecting the relational aspect of humanity. The term "glory" indicates that woman, while also made in the image of God, reflects the honor and dignity of man, as she was created from him and for him. This does not imply inferiority but rather a distinct and honored role within the created order. The relationship between man and woman is further explored in <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>, where the mutual respect and love between husband and wife are likened to the relationship between Christ and the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing issues within the Corinthian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and cultural influences, which often led to challenges in the early church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, struggling with issues of order and propriety in worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam_and_eve.htm">Adam and Eve</a></b><br>The first man and woman, referenced implicitly in discussions of creation and glory.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_christian_worship_setting.htm">The Early Christian Worship Setting</a></b><br>The context in which head coverings and gender roles were being debated.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_glory_and_image.htm">Understanding Glory and Image</a></b><br>Men are called to reflect God's image and glory, emphasizing their role in leadership and representation of divine order.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_women_in_creation.htm">Role of Women in Creation</a></b><br>Women, as the glory of man, highlight the complementary nature of gender roles, rooted in the creation account.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_context_and_worship.htm">Cultural Context and Worship</a></b><br>The instruction about head coverings reflects cultural norms of the time, urging believers to respect order and propriety in worship settings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/headship_and_authority.htm">Headship and Authority</a></b><br>The passage underscores the biblical principle of headship, encouraging men to lead with integrity and women to honor this structure.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_god's_order_in_modern_times.htm">Reflecting God's Order in Modern Times</a></b><br>While cultural expressions may change, the underlying principles of order and respect in gender roles remain relevant for contemporary application.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_11_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 11:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_11_7_God_s_design_for_genders.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 11:7 reflect God's design for men and women?

In the three following verses, <a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.">1Corinthians 11:7-9</a>, the ground of the argument is changed, and the same conclusion is arrived at from a review of (<span class= "ital">a</span>) the woman's relation to man, and (<span class= "ital">b</span>) man's relation to God in the physical Creation. The external form of this argument is the same as that adopted previously. The Apostle first states what the man must not do, and then conversely what the woman must do. The Apostle here takes up the order of creation mentioned in Genesis 1, 2, and the argument runs thus:--Man was made in the image of God, and is the glory of God; but woman is the glory of the man (for woman was made out of man, and also man was not created <span class= "ital">for</span> woman, but woman for--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> as a help-meet for--man). Therefore man, as a created being, according to the accepted order of creation, is the direct representative of God, and woman the direct representative of man (and only indirectly and through him of God). The spiritual equality of man and wife does not upset this relationship, and therefore an attempt to destroy the outward expression of it is to be condemned, as it would soon lead to an obliteration of the fact itself.<p>It is to be remembered all through this passage (and it gives a further emphasis to the allusion to Adam and Eve) that St. Paul is only speaking of married women--it is most unlikely that any case had occurred of an unmarried woman attempting such an outrage upon social feeling and national custom. The Greek women when in public (except those of avowedly bad character) either wore a veil or drew the <span class= "ital">peplum,</span> or shawl, over their heads.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is the image and glory of God.</span> Because he reflects and partakes in the glory of Christ, who is the effulgence of God and the impress of his substance (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The woman is the glory of the man.</span> As moonlight is to sunlight, or as the earthshine is to the moonshine.
