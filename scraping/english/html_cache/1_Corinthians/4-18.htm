In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul is dealing with divisions and factions within the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10-13</a>). The arrogance likely stems from a misunderstanding of spiritual gifts and leadership roles, as some members were elevating themselves above others (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-31</a>). This pride is contrary to the humility exemplified by Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>) and the servant leadership Paul advocates (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5-9</a>).<p><b>as if I were not coming to you</b><br>Paul's intention to visit the Corinthian church is a reminder of his apostolic authority and pastoral concern. The phrase suggests that some members doubted or dismissed Paul's influence, possibly due to his physical absence. Historically, travel in the ancient world was challenging, and delays were common, which might have contributed to their skepticism. Paul's planned visit is meant to correct and guide the church, emphasizing accountability and the importance of living according to the teachings of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-19.htm">1 Corinthians 4:19-21</a>). This reflects the broader biblical theme of leaders being shepherds to their flocks, as seen in the pastoral care of Jesus (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-15</a>) and the apostles (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the Corinthian church with authority and pastoral concern.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled congregation in the city of Corinth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece known for its wealth, commerce, and moral challenges, which influenced the church's behavior.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/arrogance.htm">Arrogance</a></b><br>The attitude Paul is addressing, which had developed among some members of the Corinthian church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul's_visit.htm">Paul's Visit</a></b><br>An anticipated event that Paul uses to remind the Corinthians of his authority and the need for humility.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_spiritual_pride.htm">Recognizing Spiritual Pride</a></b><br>Spiritual pride can manifest in various ways, including a sense of superiority or self-sufficiency.

He is afraid to come himself, so he sends Timothy in his stead. "But," says St. Paul, "I will come to you shortly, God willing"--his intention was to remain at Ephesus until after Pentecost (see <a href="/1_corinthians/16-8.htm" title="But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.">1Corinthians 16:8</a>)--"and then I shall take cognisance of spiritual power, and not of empty and boastful words; for that kingdom which Christ founded, and which we, his ambassadors, are establishing, does not consist in mere words, but in spiritual might."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are puffed up;</span> rather, <span class="accented">were puffed up</span>; at the time that they made these disparaging comparisons of me with others. <span class="cmt_word">As though I would not come to you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as though I were not coming to you.</span> St. Paul was on the eve of starting for Macedonia on his way to visit them (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>), but, owing to the grievous state of the Church, he subsequently changed his purpose (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-15.htm">2 Corinthians 1:15, 23</a>).
