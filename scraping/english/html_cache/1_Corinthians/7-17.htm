The concept of divine assignment is rooted in the understanding that God has a specific plan and purpose for each individual (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>). The idea of leading a life assigned by the Lord suggests a call to contentment and faithfulness in one's current circumstances, reflecting the biblical principle of stewardship (<a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>). Historically, the early church faced diverse social and economic conditions, and this directive would have encouraged believers to remain faithful regardless of their status or situation.<p><b>and to which God has called him.</b><br>The notion of calling is central to Christian theology, indicating a divine invitation to live according to God's will. This calling is not limited to vocational ministry but extends to all aspects of life, affirming that every believer has a role in God's kingdom (<a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>). The cultural context of Corinth, a city known for its diversity and moral challenges, underscores the importance of living out one's calling amidst societal pressures. This call to holiness and distinctiveness is echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><b>This is what I prescribe in all the churches.</b><br>Paul's instruction here highlights the universality of his teaching, suggesting that the principles he outlines are not unique to Corinth but applicable to all Christian communities. This reflects the apostolic authority given to Paul and the consistency of doctrine across the early church (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>). The phrase also underscores the unity of the body of Christ, as the same standards and expectations are set for all believers, regardless of geographical or cultural differences. This unity is a fulfillment of Jesus' prayer for His followers to be one (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Corinthians, providing guidance on how to live a Christian life in various circumstances.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and moral challenges, where the church faced issues of division and immorality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, struggling with questions about marriage, singleness, and social status.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, who assigns each believer their place in life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_calling.htm">God's Calling</a></b><br>The divine invitation or assignment given to each believer, which Paul emphasizes should be retained.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God has sovereignly assigned each person their place in life.

A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God has called us to peace.">1Corinthians 7:15</a> as a general principle to be ever borne in mind, as limiting in practice the very broad liberty which the Apostle has given regarding separation in cases of mixed marriages. It is to be noticed that in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God has called us to peace.">1Corinthians 7:15</a> the unbelieving partner is the only one who is spoken of as taking an active part in the separation; the believer is, merely for the sake of peace, to acquiesce in it; he is never to cause or promote a separation, for he is to be guided by the great principle that we are to continue to walk in those social and political relations by which we were bound when God called us. Christianity does not destroy them, but purifies and exalts them, and thus makes them more binding on us than before. According as the Lord has divided to each man his portion in life, and as God has called each man, so in that condition let him continue to walk as a Christian. Let him not try to change it for another. The words "God" and "Lord" have been transposed by later copyists. The order in the English version is different from that in the older MSS. It is important to preserve the accurate reading here, for it speaks of Christ--"the Lord"--as the one who allots to men their natural condition in life, while "God" calls them from heathenism to the Christian faith.<p><span class= "bld">And so ordain I in all churches.</span>--This principle was of universal application, and the Apostle lays it down authoritatively for all Churches. The <span class= "ital">I</span> is emphatic, as the writer speaks with apostolic authority. It is noticeable that in some few later MSS. there is an attempt to weaken its force by the substitution of "I teach" for "I appoint or direct." (See <a href="/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-24.</span> - <span class="accented">Corroborative instances of the duty of remaining in the state wherein each was called.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But;</span> literally, <span class="accented">if not.</span> The phrase introduces a caution.
