The Corinthian church was composed of individuals who had lived in these ways before their conversion. This highlights the transformative power of the Gospel, emphasizing that no past sin is beyond the reach of God's grace. It also serves as a reminder of the diversity within the early church, which included people from various backgrounds and pasts.<p><b>But you were washed,</b><br>The term "washed" signifies spiritual cleansing, often associated with baptism, which symbolizes the washing away of sins. This cleansing is not merely external but represents an inner purification. In the Jewish tradition, ritual washing was common, but here it signifies a deeper, spiritual renewal. This aligns with passages like <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>, which speaks of the washing of regeneration.<p><b>you were sanctified,</b><br>Sanctification refers to being set apart for God's purposes. It is both a definitive act and a progressive process. At conversion, believers are sanctified, meaning they are declared holy and set apart. This is a common theme in Paul's writings, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>, where sanctification is God's will for believers. It reflects the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life, conforming them to the image of Christ.<p><b>you were justified,</b><br>Justification is a legal term indicating that believers are declared righteous before God. This is a central doctrine in Christian theology, emphasizing that righteousness is imputed to believers through faith in Christ, not by works. <a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a> elaborates on this, stating that we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. It underscores the completed work of Christ on the cross, which satisfies the demands of God's justice.<p><b>in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and power of Jesus in the believer's transformation. In biblical times, a name represented a person's character and authority. <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a> emphasizes that salvation is found in no one else but Jesus. This highlights the exclusivity of Christ as the mediator between God and humanity, and the source of all spiritual blessings.<p><b>and by the Spirit of our God.</b><br>The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in the believer's transformation, from conviction of sin to empowerment for holy living. The Spirit is the agent of regeneration and sanctification, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a> and <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-25</a>. This phrase emphasizes the Trinitarian work in salvation, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all actively involved in the redemption and sanctification of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece known for its wealth and moral decadence.

The words "sanctified" and "justified" as used here do not point to those definite stages in the Christian course to which they generally refer in theological language. The sanctification is here mentioned before the justification, which is not the actual sequence, and it must not therefore be taken as signifying a gradual progress in holiness. What the Apostle urges is, that as they washed themselves in the waters of baptism, so they, by the power of Christ's name and the Holy Spirit, became holy and righteous, thus putting aside, washing off as it were, that impurity and that unrighteousness which once were theirs, and with which they could not enter into the kingdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And such were some of you;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and these things some of you were.</span> As Gentiles, many of them had been "dead in trespasses and sins" (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>).
