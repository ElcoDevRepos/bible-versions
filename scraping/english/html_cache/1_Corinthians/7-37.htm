In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/7.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>, Paul addresses issues of marriage and singleness. The "man" here refers to someone who has a strong, unwavering commitment to his decision. Biblically, the heart is often seen as the center of will and emotion (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). This stability is crucial for making decisions that align with God's will, reflecting the biblical principle of being "double-minded" (<a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>).<p><b>and under no constraint</b><br>This suggests that the decision is made freely, without external pressure or obligation. In the cultural context of Corinth, societal and familial pressures regarding marriage were significant. Paul emphasizes the importance of making decisions based on personal conviction rather than succumbing to societal norms or expectations. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of freedom in Christ (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<p><b>with control over his will</b><br>Self-control is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>) and is essential for living a life that pleases God. The ability to control one's will indicates maturity and spiritual discipline. In the Greco-Roman world, self-control was also a valued virtue, often associated with wisdom and moral integrity. This phrase underscores the importance of self-mastery in making life decisions.<p><b>and resolve in his heart not to marry the virgin</b><br>The "virgin" likely refers to a betrothed woman or a daughter under the man's guardianship. The decision not to marry is presented as a valid and honorable choice, reflecting Paul's broader teaching on singleness and marriage in this chapter. This choice is not seen as inferior to marriage but as a legitimate option for those who feel called to it. The resolve in the heart indicates a deliberate and thoughtful decision, aligning with Paul's teaching that each person should live according to their calling (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-17.htm">1 Corinthians 7:17</a>).<p><b>he will do well</b><br>Paul concludes that the decision to remain unmarried is commendable. This reflects the broader biblical teaching that both marriage and singleness are gifts from God (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7</a>). The phrase "he will do well" suggests that the decision aligns with God's will and purpose for the individual. It also highlights the principle that what matters is not the state of being married or single, but living a life devoted to God (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-32.htm">1 Corinthians 7:32-35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on marriage and singleness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled congregation in the city of Corinth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virgin.htm">The Virgin</a></b><br>Refers to an unmarried woman, possibly a daughter or a betrothed, in the context of the cultural and social norms of the time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/firmness_of_heart.htm">Firmness of Heart</a></b><br>The Greek word (hedraios) implies being steadfast and immovable.

This teaches the importance of making life choices based on personal conviction and divine guidance rather than societal or familial pressure.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-control_and_will.htm">Self-Control and Will</a></b><br>Exercising control over one's will is crucial.
