In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>, Paul addresses questions about the nature of the resurrection body. The imagery of sowing a seed is used to illustrate transformation and continuity. The seed, when sown, does not resemble the plant it will become, highlighting the difference between our earthly bodies and our resurrected bodies. This concept is rooted in the Jewish understanding of resurrection, which anticipates a future transformation. The metaphor also connects to Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/12-24.htm">John 12:24</a>, where He speaks of a grain of wheat dying to produce much fruit, symbolizing His death and resurrection.<p><b>but just a seed</b><br>The term "seed" here is significant in biblical symbolism, often representing potential and new beginnings. In <a href="/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11-12</a>, God commands the earth to bring forth vegetation, each according to its kind, emphasizing the idea of life and growth inherent in a seed. The seed metaphor also reflects the mystery of life and transformation, as seen in the parables of Jesus, such as the Parable of the Mustard Seed (<a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>). The seed must be buried and undergo a transformation to fulfill its purpose, paralleling the believer's hope in the resurrection.<p><b>perhaps of wheat or something else</b><br>Paul uses wheat as an example, a staple crop in the ancient Near East, familiar to his audience. Wheat was a primary food source, and its growth cycle was well understood, making it an effective illustration. The mention of "something else" broadens the metaphor to include various types of seeds, emphasizing the diversity of resurrection bodies. This diversity is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-39.htm">1 Corinthians 15:39-41</a>, where Paul discusses the different kinds of flesh and celestial bodies, underscoring the uniqueness of the resurrection body. The reference to wheat also connects to the harvest imagery found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>, where Jesus speaks of the plentiful harvest and the need for laborers, symbolizing the gathering of believers in the end times.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

Each seed rises with its own "body;" a corn seed grows up into corn, an acorn into an oak. All through this passage the word "body" is used in a general sense for "organism," so as to keep strictly and vividly before the reader the ultimate truth to illustrate which these analogies are introduced. The points of analogy between the sowing and growth of seed and the life and resurrection of man are <span class= "ital">not,</span> as some writers put it--(1) the seed is sown, and man is buried; (2) the seed rots, and man's body decays; (3) the seed grows up, and man is raised. Such a series of analogies are misleading, for there is no necessity for the body of man to <span class= "ital">decay,</span> but only a necessity for it to die (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1Corinthians 15:51-52</a>). The points of analogy are these:--(1) The seed is sown in the earth, and man is born into the world; (2) the seed dies and decays--man dies; (3) the seed grows through its very decay--man rises through death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not that body that shall be.</span> This deep remark should have checked the idly and offensively materialistic form in which the doctrine of the resurrection is often taught. <span class="cmt_word">But bare grain.</span> Wickliffe, "a naked corne." In this passage, almost alone in all his Epistles, St. Paul, who does not seem to have been at all a close observer of external phenomena, uses metaphors drawn from natural life. His usual metaphors are chiefly architectural and agonistic - derived, that is, from buildings and games. That he was not a student of nature arose, no doubt, partly kern his Semitic cast of mind, but chiefly from his being short sighted, and from his having spent most of his early life in large cities. <span class="cmt_word">It may chance;</span> <span class="accented">if it so happen</span>, (see note on 1 Corinthians 14:10). The English word "chance" occurs but four times in the whole Bible (<a href="/1_samuel/6-9.htm">1 Samuel 6:9</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>). In <a href="/luke/10-31.htm">Luke 10:31</a> the words rendered "by chance" mean rather "by coincidence." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/15-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">what</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8003;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you sow</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#960;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(speireis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4687.htm">Strong's 4687: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sow, spread, scatter.
