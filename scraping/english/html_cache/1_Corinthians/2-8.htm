In a historical context, figures like Pontius Pilate and the Sanhedrin were instrumental in the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion. Spiritually, this phrase also alludes to the unseen powers and principalities mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, which were blinded to God's plan of salvation through Christ. The "it" refers to the wisdom of God, which is a mystery revealed through the Gospel. This wisdom was hidden from the rulers, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where God speaks of people who will hear but not understand. The lack of understanding by these rulers highlights the divine nature of God's plan, which transcends human wisdom and insight.<p><b>For if they had,</b><br>This conditional statement underscores the ignorance of the rulers regarding the true identity and mission of Jesus. It implies that their actions were based on a lack of spiritual discernment. The rulers' failure to recognize Jesus as the Messiah was a fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who would be rejected by men. This lack of understanding was part of God's sovereign plan, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>, where Peter explains that Jesus was delivered up according to God's predetermined plan and foreknowledge.<p><b>they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</b><br>The term "crucified" refers to the Roman method of execution, which was reserved for the most serious criminals and was considered a curse under Jewish law (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). The crucifixion of Jesus was a pivotal event in Christian theology, as it represents the atoning sacrifice for humanity's sins. The title "Lord of glory" is a profound acknowledgment of Jesus' divine nature and majesty, connecting Him to the glory of God described in passages like <a href="/psalms/24-7.htm">Psalm 24:7-10</a>. This title emphasizes the irony and tragedy of the crucifixion, as the rulers unknowingly put to death the very embodiment of divine glory. The crucifixion, however, was not the end but the means through which God accomplished salvation, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-21</a>, where the precious blood of Christ is described as the means of redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rulers_of_this_age.htm">Rulers of this Age</a></b><br>Refers to both the spiritual and earthly authorities at the time of Jesus' crucifixion, including Roman and Jewish leaders.
