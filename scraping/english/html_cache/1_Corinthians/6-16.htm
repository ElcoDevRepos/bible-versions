In the context of Corinth, a city known for its rampant immorality and the presence of temple prostitution, this warning is particularly poignant. The phrase "unites himself" implies a deep, physical connection that goes beyond a mere transaction. The concept of becoming "one with her in body" highlights the spiritual and physical union that occurs during sexual intercourse, which is meant to be reserved for the sanctity of marriage. This teaching aligns with the biblical understanding of sexual purity and the sanctity of the body as a temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>). The warning serves as a reminder of the consequences of sexual sin, which not only affects the individual but also defiles the body, which is meant to honor God.<p><b>For it is said, &#8220;The two will become one flesh.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a direct reference to <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where God establishes the institution of marriage. The "one flesh" union is a divine ordinance that signifies the complete and exclusive union between a husband and wife. By invoking this scripture, Paul emphasizes the sacredness of the marital bond and the profound mystery of two becoming one. This union is not merely physical but also emotional and spiritual, reflecting the unity and intimacy intended by God. The misuse of this union through illicit relationships, such as with a prostitute, distorts and devalues the divine purpose of marriage. This teaching also foreshadows the relationship between Christ and the Church, as described in <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>, where the marital union is a type of the greater spiritual union between Christ and His bride. The call to purity and fidelity in marriage is a reflection of the covenantal faithfulness that God desires with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance and correction on moral and spiritual issues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled early Christian community in Corinth, known for its struggles with immorality and division.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prostitutes.htm">Prostitutes</a></b><br>In the context of Corinth, prostitution was a common practice, often linked to pagan worship and societal norms.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/genesis_reference.htm">Genesis Reference</a></b><br>Paul references <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where the concept of "one flesh" is first introduced in the context of marriage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth, commerce, and moral challenges, including widespread sexual immorality.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_the_body.htm">The Sanctity of the Body</a></b><br>Our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, and we must honor God with them by avoiding sexual immorality.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_intimacy.htm">Unity and Intimacy</a></b><br>Sexual relations create a profound unity, intended for the covenant of marriage, reflecting God's design.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/moral_purity.htm">Moral Purity</a></b><br>Christians are called to live counter-culturally, resisting societal norms that contradict biblical teachings on sexuality.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_implications.htm">Spiritual Implications</a></b><br>Engaging in sexual immorality affects not only the body but also one's spiritual relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>There is grace and forgiveness for those who have fallen into sexual sin, and God offers restoration through repentance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_6_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 6:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_6_16_on_sexual_immorality.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 6:16 define the spiritual implications of sexual immorality?

He reminds believers that certain truths are already settled by God&#8217;s Word, so ignorance is never an excuse. The statement recalls <a href="/proverbs/7-22.htm">Proverbs 7:22&#8211;23</a>, where folly follows a prostitute &#8220;like an ox going to the slaughter,&#8221; underscoring that sexual sin is never a private matter; it bears real, spiritual consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He who unites himself with a prostitute</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Unites&#8221; (BSB: &#8220;joins&#8221;) speaks of a deliberate, physical choice that fuses two lives.<p>&#8226; The act violates the believer&#8217;s calling to be &#8220;joined to the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-17.htm">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>) and set apart for holiness (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently warns against sexual immorality: <a href="/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>.

Christ-followers, already members of His body (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>), compromise that sacred union when they unite with sin.<p>&#8226; The warning mirrors <a href="/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a>, which urges believers not to &#8220;offer the parts of your body to sin.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For it is said, &#8220;The two will become one flesh.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Quoting <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> (also echoed by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/19-5.htm">Matthew 19:5</a> and <a href="/mark/10-8.htm">Mark 10:8</a>), Paul appeals to the very first marriage covenant.<p>&#8226; The verse affirms God&#8217;s original design: lifelong, exclusive unity. Any sexual act outside that covenant still forges a one-flesh bond, but in a context God never blessed, producing guilt, brokenness, and spiritual defilement.<p>&#8226; By rooting his argument in creation, Paul shows this standard predates culture, covenants, or law; it is woven into human nature itself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/6-16.htm">1 Corinthians 6:16</a> teaches that sexual union is never casual.

"Do you not know that my strong assertion is true? It is not merely my statement; it is to be found in the Old Testament, 'Two shall be one flesh.'" This was originally (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a>) applied to marriage, as showing the intimacy of that sacred union, but here St. Paul applies it to one aspect of a union which, in one respect, was identical with marriage. Of course the other parts of the Apostle's argument do not apply to marriage, the union being a sacred one; two becoming one flesh in marriage is no degradation of a member of Christ--nay, it is a sacred illustration of the complete unity of Christ and His body the Church. (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/11-29.htm" title="For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.">1Corinthians 11:29</a>, and Notes there.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What, know ye not,</span> etc.?
