In the context of Corinth, a city known for its intellectualism and philosophical debates, Paul's approach contrasts sharply with the prevailing culture. His resolution indicates a conscious choice to avoid engaging in the philosophical and rhetorical styles that were popular in Corinth. This decision underscores the simplicity and power of the Gospel message, emphasizing that human wisdom and eloquence are secondary to the transformative power of Christ's message. This approach aligns with Paul's broader teaching in 1 Corinthians, where he contrasts human wisdom with the wisdom of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18-25</a>).<p><b>except Jesus Christ</b><br>Paul's focus on Jesus Christ highlights the centrality of Christ in Christian teaching and life. By emphasizing Jesus, Paul points to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the embodiment of God's plan for salvation. This focus is consistent with the broader New Testament narrative, which presents Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of God, and the Savior of the world. The emphasis on Jesus alone also serves as a corrective to any tendencies within the Corinthian church to elevate other leaders or teachings above Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12-13</a>).<p><b>and Him crucified</b><br>The crucifixion of Jesus is the cornerstone of Christian faith, representing the ultimate sacrifice for sin and the means of reconciliation between God and humanity. In a cultural context where crucifixion was seen as a shameful and humiliating death, Paul's emphasis on the crucified Christ is both countercultural and revolutionary. It underscores the paradox of the Gospel: that God's power and wisdom are revealed through what the world considers weakness and foolishness (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23-24</a>). This focus on the crucifixion also connects to the Old Testament sacrificial system, where the shedding of blood was necessary for atonement, pointing to Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and epistles.

We have here a statement of what was ever the subject-matter of apostolic teaching. St. Paul did not dwell on the miraculous in the life of Christ, which would have pandered to the Jewish longing for a "sign"; nor did he put forward elaborate "theories" of the gospel, which would have been a concession to the Greek's longing after "wisdom": but he preached a personal Christ, and especially dwelt on the fact that He had been crucified (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.">1Corinthians 1:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;">1Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-14.htm" title="But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.">Galatians 6:14</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.">Philippians 2:8</a>). We can scarcely realise now the stumbling-block which the preaching of a crucified Christ must have been to Jews and Greeks, the enormous temptation to keep the cross in the background which the early teachers would naturally have felt, and the sublime and confident faith which must have nerved St. Paul to make it the central fact of all his teaching. For us the cross is illumined with the glories of eighteen centuries of civilisation, and consecrated with the memory of all that is best and noblest in the history of Christendom. To every Jew and to every Gentile it conveyed but one idea, that of the most revolting and most degrading punishment. The remembrance of this fact will enable us to realise how uncompromising was the Apostles' teaching--how it never "accommodated itself" to any existing desire or prejudice. This surely is no small evidence of the divine origin of the religion of which the Apostles were the heralds!<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I determined.</span> The unadorned simplicity of my teaching was part of a fixed design. <span class="cmt_word">Not to know anything.</span> Not, that is, to <span class="accented">depend</span> on any human knowledge.
