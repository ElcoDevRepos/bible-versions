It suggests that the Corinthians should already be aware of the truth he is about to state, indicating a foundational teaching in the early church. This approach is common in Paul's letters, where he often reminds believers of essential truths they may have overlooked or forgotten.<p><b>that you yourselves are God&#8217;s temple</b><br>In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul addresses divisions and immorality within the church. By referring to the believers as God's temple, he underscores the sacredness of the community. The temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship, symbolizing God's presence among His people. By calling the church God's temple, Paul elevates the spiritual status of the believers, indicating that God's presence now resides within them collectively. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, where the temple was the dwelling place of God (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27-30</a>). It also connects to Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>, where He refers to His body as a temple, foreshadowing the new covenant where believers become the temple of God.<p><b>and that God&#8217;s Spirit dwells in you?</b><br>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is a key doctrine in the New Testament, signifying the new relationship between God and believers through Christ. This indwelling is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to put His Spirit within His people. The presence of the Holy Spirit is a mark of the new covenant, initiated by Jesus' death and resurrection. It empowers believers for holy living and service, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>. The Spirit's indwelling also serves as a guarantee of the believer's inheritance in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>). This truth calls the Corinthians to live in a manner worthy of their status as God's temple, avoiding divisions and immorality that would defile the sacred community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with teachings and corrections.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often divided early Christian community in the city of Corinth, known for its moral and spiritual challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_temple.htm">God&#8217;s Temple</a></b><br>A metaphorical reference to the collective body of believers, emphasizing holiness and the indwelling presence of God&#8217;s Spirit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_spirit.htm">God&#8217;s Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit, who dwells within believers, signifying God&#8217;s presence and power in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_identity.htm">Understanding Our Identity</a></b><br>Recognize that as believers, we are collectively God&#8217;s temple, which calls for a life of holiness and unity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_indwelling_spirit.htm">The Indwelling Spirit</a></b><br>Embrace the reality that God&#8217;s Spirit dwells within us, empowering us to live according to His will and purpose.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>Live a life that reflects the holiness of God&#8217;s temple, avoiding actions and attitudes that defile it.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_body_of_christ.htm">Unity in the Body of Christ</a></b><br>Foster unity and love within the church, understanding that division undermines the integrity of God&#8217;s temple.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_of_god's_presence.htm">Stewardship of God&#8217;s Presence</a></b><br>Be mindful of how we conduct ourselves, knowing that we carry God&#8217;s presence into every aspect of our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_3_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 3:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_3_16_Holy_Spirit_s_vital_role.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 3:16 emphasize the importance of the Holy Spirit's presence?

He has already taught these believers basic truths, so the question underscores their accountability (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses this phrase to jolt readers out of complacency&#8212;&#8220;Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15</a>) is one example. The repetition signals that certain truths should be settled in the heart of every believer.<p>&#8226; It also implies that ignorance is not an option. With the completed canon in hand, we cannot claim we were never told (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that you yourselves are God&#8217;s temple,</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;You yourselves&#8221; is plural, highlighting the corporate nature of the Church. Each believer matters, but together we form the single dwelling place of God on earth (<a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21&#8211;22</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The temple motif would have been vivid to both Jewish and Gentile readers. In the Old Testament, God&#8217;s glory filled Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10&#8211;11</a>). Now, instead of a building of stone and cedar, He inhabits people redeemed by the blood of Christ (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the temple was set apart for holy use, believers are called to the same consecration. Paul&#8217;s wider context warns against worldly divisions and fleshly living that would defile God&#8217;s sacred dwelling (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3, 17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and that God&#8217;s Spirit dwells in you?</b><p>&#8226; The indwelling Spirit is not a metaphor; it is the literal presence of God within every believer from the moment of salvation (<a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; His residency fulfills Jesus&#8217; promise: &#8220;He remains with you and will be in you&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>). This transforming presence empowers obedience, unifies the body, and testifies that we belong to Christ (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the Spirit is holy, accommodating sin in heart or congregation grieves Him (<a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>). The warning in verse 17&#8212;&#8220;If anyone destroys God&#8217;s temple, God will destroy him&#8221;&#8212;shows how seriously the Lord guards His dwelling place.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a> reminds believers that ignorance is inexcusable, identity is corporate, and intimacy with God is real.
