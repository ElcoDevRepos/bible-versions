The term "acting inappropriately" suggests a concern for maintaining moral integrity and social propriety. This reflects the biblical principle of honoring commitments and maintaining purity, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</a>, which emphasizes sanctification and abstaining from sexual immorality.<p><b>and if she is beyond her youth</b><br>The phrase "beyond her youth" indicates a woman who has reached an age where marriage is culturally expected. In ancient times, this often meant late teens or early twenties. The cultural expectation was for women to marry relatively young, and delaying marriage could lead to social stigma or economic disadvantage. This reflects the biblical understanding of marriage as a normative and honorable state (<a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>).<p><b>and they ought to marry</b><br>The phrase "ought to marry" suggests a moral or practical obligation. In the biblical context, marriage is seen as a God-ordained institution (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>) and a means to fulfill God's command to be fruitful and multiply (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). The decision to marry should be guided by wisdom and discernment, considering factors such as mutual love, commitment, and the ability to fulfill marital responsibilities.<p><b>let him do as he wishes; he is not sinning</b><br>This phrase underscores the freedom and personal responsibility in making the decision to marry. It aligns with the biblical teaching that marriage is a good and honorable choice (<a href="/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>). The assurance that "he is not sinning" provides comfort and clarity, affirming that marriage is a legitimate and righteous option for those who are betrothed.<p><b>they should get married</b><br>The directive "they should get married" reinforces the appropriateness of marriage in this situation. It reflects the biblical view that marriage is a covenant relationship designed by God for companionship, procreation, and mutual support (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-33</a>). This instruction aligns with the broader scriptural narrative that values marriage as a reflection of Christ's relationship with the Church, highlighting themes of love, sacrifice, and unity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing issues within the Corinthian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled early Christian community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virgin.htm">The Virgin</a></b><br>Refers to a young woman of marriageable age, possibly under the guardianship of a father or a betrothed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>A central theme in this passage, reflecting cultural and spiritual considerations of the time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_context.htm">Cultural Context</a></b><br>The societal norms and expectations regarding marriage and virginity in the Greco-Roman world.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_cultural_context.htm">Understanding Cultural Context</a></b><br>Recognize the cultural and historical context of Paul's advice.
