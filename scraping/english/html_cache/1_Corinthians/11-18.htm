It suggests a sequence of issues that Paul intends to address, highlighting the importance of the matter at hand. The use of "first" underscores the urgency and priority of resolving the divisions within the church.<p><b>I hear that when you come together as a church,</b><br>Paul is referring to the gatherings of the early Christian community in Corinth. These meetings were likely held in homes, as the early church did not have dedicated buildings for worship. The phrase "come together" emphasizes the communal aspect of worship and fellowship, which is central to the Christian faith. The church in Corinth was diverse, consisting of Jews and Gentiles, rich and poor, which often led to tensions and misunderstandings.<p><b>there are divisions among you,</b><br>The divisions Paul mentions are likely related to various factions within the church, as earlier in the letter (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10-13</a>), he addresses the issue of believers aligning themselves with different leaders (Paul, Apollos, Cephas, and Christ). These divisions could also be social or economic, reflecting the broader societal stratifications of Corinth, a cosmopolitan city known for its wealth and immorality. The divisions undermine the unity that Christ prayed for in <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a> and contradict the body metaphor Paul uses in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>.<p><b>and in part I believe it.</b><br>Paul acknowledges the reports he has received, indicating that he trusts the sources of this information. His partial belief suggests that while he is aware of the issues, he may not have the full picture, or he hopes that the situation is not as severe as reported. This reflects Paul's pastoral concern and his desire to address the issues with both truth and grace. His approach is consistent with the biblical principle of seeking to restore relationships and maintain unity within the body of Christ, as seen in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a> and <a href="/galatians/6.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the Corinthian church with pastoral concern and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often divided congregation in the city of Corinth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/divisions_in_the_church.htm">Divisions in the Church</a></b><br>The specific issue Paul addresses, indicating a lack of unity among the believers when they gather.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_unity.htm">The Importance of Unity</a></b><br>Unity is essential for the health and witness of the church.

Reliable reports of divisions grieve the apostle because gatherings are meant to display Christ&#8217;s love, not human factions. He addresses the issue first, models wise discernment, and calls the church to live out the oneness secured by the Lord. The verse reminds today&#8217;s congregations to prize fellowship, guard against strife, and pursue harmony that honors Jesus before a watching world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">For first of all.</span>--We in vain look for the "secondly," which, in a perfectly systematic treatise, should follow this "first." Some writers maintain that <a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-18.htm" title="For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.">1Corinthians 11:18-19</a> form the first point, and <a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20-34</a> the second. There is, however, no indication of a new subject being introduced with <a href="/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20</a>, but the repetition of the words "come together" carries the mind back at once to the "come together" in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-18.htm" title="For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.">1Corinthians 11:18</a>, and indicates the continuation of the subject there commenced, and from which the Apostle had, at the mention of the word "divisions," for a moment parenthetically digressed.<p>It is better to consider the "first point" to be the abuse regarding the Lord's Supper, which is more immediately treated of; and the "second point," the abuse of spiritual gifts, commencing with <a href="/1_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant.">1Corinthians 12:1</a>. They are two branches of the one general subject, viz., "Irregularities in religious assemblies," and although the latter is not connected with the former by a definite "secondly," there is a sufficient verbal indication that a second topic is entered upon. It is well to remember in this and similar cases that this is not a treatise, but a letter, and not only a letter, but an answer to a letter, and that if we had a copy of the epistle to which this is a reply, many points of sequence and arrangement, which at present present difficulties, would be as clear to us as they were to those who originally received this Epistle. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">First of all.</span> The "second" rebuke is not clearly stated, but is no doubt meant to refer to the abuses in "speaking with the tongue." <span class="cmt_word">In the Church;</span> rather, <span class="accented">in congregation</span>, or <span class="accented">assembly.</span> The reference is not to a particular building.
