Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham, deeply rooted in Jewish identity (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). For Jewish Christians, circumcision was a physical mark of their heritage and religious commitment. Paul emphasizes that one's physical state at the time of their calling to faith in Christ is not of primary importance. This reflects the New Testament teaching that faith in Christ transcends cultural and religious boundaries (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>He should not become uncircumcised.</b><br>The idea of becoming "uncircumcised" is metaphorical, as physically reversing circumcision is not possible. Historically, some Jews in the Greco-Roman world attempted to hide their circumcision to assimilate into Gentile society, especially in contexts like gymnasiums where nudity was common. Paul advises against such actions, emphasizing that one's identity in Christ should not be compromised for social acceptance. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that believers are called to be distinct from the world (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p><b>Was a man still uncircumcised when called?</b><br>Paul addresses Gentile believers who were not circumcised, which was the norm outside of Jewish communities. The early church grappled with whether Gentile converts needed to adopt Jewish customs, including circumcision, to be fully accepted (<a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15:1-29</a>). Paul consistently taught that faith in Christ, not adherence to the law, was the basis for salvation (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). This reflects the fulfillment of the law through Christ and the new covenant established by His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>).<p><b>He should not be circumcised.</b><br>Paul's instruction here is clear: Gentile believers should not feel compelled to undergo circumcision to gain acceptance within the Christian community. This teaching is part of Paul's broader argument against legalism and the imposition of Jewish law on Gentile converts (<a href="/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2-6</a>). It underscores the sufficiency of Christ's work on the cross and the unity of believers regardless of cultural or religious background. This principle is foundational to the doctrine of justification by faith and the universality of the gospel message (<a href="/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on various issues, including cultural and religious practices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and cultural influences, including both Jewish and Gentile communities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_and_gentile_believers.htm">Jewish and Gentile Believers</a></b><br>The early Christian church was composed of both Jewish and Gentile converts, each bringing their own cultural and religious backgrounds.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/circumcision.htm">Circumcision</a></b><br>A physical sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants, significant in Jewish tradition.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The community of believers navigating the integration of Jewish and Gentile practices in the context of their new faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_identity_in_christ.htm">Cultural Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Our identity in Christ transcends cultural and religious markers.

The early fortunes of Christianity had been almost shipwrecked by the attempt of Jewish rigorists to enforce this odious bondage on the Gentiles, and their deliverance flora it had been due almost solely to St. Paul. It was his inspired insight which had swayed the decision of the synod at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>.); and at a later period his Epistle to the Galatians was the manifesto of Gentile emancipation. He proved that after Christ's death "circumcision" (<span class="accented">peritome</span>) became to Gentiles a mere physical mutilation (<span class="accented">katatome</span>) (<a href="/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/7-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Was} a man</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
