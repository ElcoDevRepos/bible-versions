It reflects the biblical teaching that salvation is initiated by God, not by human effort (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The phrase "in Christ Jesus" is a key Pauline concept, indicating a spiritual union with Christ. This union is central to the believer's identity and is foundational to the New Testament's teaching on salvation and sanctification (<a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a>, <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>). The phrase also echoes the covenantal language found throughout Scripture, where God is the initiator of a relationship with His people (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>).<p><b>who has become for us wisdom from God</b><br>In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul addresses a church struggling with divisions and a reliance on human wisdom. By stating that Christ has become wisdom from God, Paul contrasts divine wisdom with human wisdom, which the Corinthians were wrongly valuing (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18-25</a>). This wisdom is not merely intellectual but is embodied in the person and work of Jesus Christ. The Old Testament often associates wisdom with the fear of the Lord and righteous living (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), and in Christ, this wisdom is fully revealed and accessible to believers.<p><b>our righteousness</b><br>Righteousness in this context refers to the believer's right standing before God, which is made possible through faith in Christ (<a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>). This righteousness is not achieved by adherence to the law but is imputed to believers through Christ's sacrificial death and resurrection (<a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>). The concept of righteousness is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where it is associated with God's covenant faithfulness and justice (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<p><b>holiness</b><br>Holiness, or sanctification, is the process by which believers are set apart for God's purposes and are progressively transformed into the likeness of Christ (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-7</a>). This transformation is both a positional reality, as believers are declared holy through Christ, and a practical process, as they grow in godliness. The call to holiness is a recurring theme in Scripture, reflecting God's own holy nature and His desire for His people to be distinct from the world (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><b>and redemption</b><br>Redemption refers to the deliverance from sin and its consequences, achieved through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). This term evokes the imagery of a ransom being paid to free a slave, a concept familiar in the Greco-Roman world and deeply rooted in the Exodus narrative, where God redeemed Israel from slavery in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). In the New Testament, Christ's redemptive work is seen as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and types, such as the Passover lamb (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, a city known for its diversity and moral challenges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ_jesus.htm">Christ Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, through whom believers receive wisdom, righteousness, holiness, and redemption.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality, where the early church faced significant challenges.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The source of all wisdom and the one who places believers in Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, struggling with divisions and moral issues.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_our_wisdom.htm">Christ as Our Wisdom</a></b><br>Jesus embodies the wisdom of God, surpassing human understanding and philosophies.

He is the author of the spiritual life of us who are in union with Christ, "who <span class= "ital">was</span> (not "is") made wisdom unto us <span class= "ital">from</span> God." The past tense here refers us back to the fact of the Incarnation; in it Christ became to us God's revelation of Himself, thus giving us a wisdom from the source of all wisdom, which surpasses utterly any wisdom we could have derived from nature or from man. Not only is Christ the source of whatever true wisdom we have, but also (so adds the Apostle) of whatever "righteousness" and "holiness" we have--spiritual gifts, as well as gifts of knowledge, come all from Him--and beyond all that, He is also our redemption, the "ransom" paid for us, by which we are redeemed from the bondage and slavery of sin.

This is the theme of <a href="/romans/3-7.htm">Romans 3:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Sanctification</span> (see especially <a href="/1_corinthians/6-11.htm">1 Corinthians 6:11</a> and <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25, 26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Redemption</span>. One of the four main metaphors by which the atonement is described is this of ransom (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). The meaning and nature of the act, <span class="accented">as regards God</span>, lie in regions above our comprehension; so that all speculations as to the person to whom the ransom was paid, and the reason why it was indispensable, have only led to centuries of mistaken theology. But the meaning and nature of it, <span class="accented">as regards man</span>, is our deliverance from bondage, and the payment of the debt which we had incurred (<a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21-23</a>). In all these cases, as Stanley well observes, the words have a double meaning - both of an inward act and of an outward result. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[It is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">because of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#958;</span> <span class="translit">(Ex)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1537.htm">Strong's 1537: </a> </span><span class="str2">From out, out from among, from, suggesting from the interior outwards.
