This reflects the early Christian understanding of the church as a family, united by faith in Christ. The use of "brothers" also indicates the inclusive nature of the message, addressing both men and women as part of the spiritual family.<p><b>Each one should remain</b><br>Paul advises believers to remain in their current circumstances, which reflects a broader theme in his letters about contentment and faithfulness in one's present situation. This counsel is not about complacency but about recognizing God's sovereignty and purpose in each person's life. It echoes the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>, where believers are encouraged not to worry about their lives but to trust in God's provision.<p><b>In the situation he was in</b><br>The "situation" refers to one's social, economic, or marital status at the time of conversion. In the context of <a href="/1_corinthians/7.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>, Paul addresses various life situations, including marriage, singleness, and slavery. The early church was diverse, with members from different backgrounds, and Paul's guidance was to live out their faith within their existing circumstances, trusting that God can work through any situation.<p><b>When God called him</b><br>The concept of being "called" by God is central to Paul's theology. It signifies the divine initiative in salvation and the believer's response to God's grace. This calling is not just to salvation but to a life of holiness and service. The idea of calling also connects to the Old Testament, where God called individuals like Abraham and Moses for specific purposes, highlighting the continuity of God's plan throughout scripture.<br><br>This passage encourages believers to trust in God's timing and purpose, recognizing that their current circumstances are part of His divine plan. It also underscores the transformative power of the gospel, which transcends social and cultural boundaries, calling individuals to a new identity in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and extensive writings that form a significant portion of the New Testament.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality.

Paul had just said, &#8220;Each one should remain in the situation he was in when he was called&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-20.htm">1 Corinthians 7:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Contentment recognizes God&#8217;s sovereignty over life settings (<a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul is not forbidding legitimate change&#8212;he immediately adds, &#8220;But if you can gain your freedom, do so&#8221; regarding slavery (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21</a>). The thrust: don&#8217;t let external change become a prerequisite for obedience or joy.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; own command, &#8220;Remain in Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>), anchors the heart so that outward circumstances need not dictate spiritual fruitfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the situation</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Situation&#8221; covers social, marital, and vocational stations&#8212;married or single (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-27.htm">1 Corinthians 7:27-28</a>), circumcised or not (7:18-19), slave or free (7:21-22).<p>&#8226; It does NOT sanction staying in sinful patterns. Paul earlier insisted, &#8220;Such were some of you&#8221; when listing sins that must be forsaken (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Everyday roles become arenas for faithful witness, much like John the Baptist told tax collectors and soldiers to serve honestly where they were (<a href="/luke/3-12.htm">Luke 3:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Whatever the task, &#8220;Work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was in</b><p>&#8226; God knows the exact context into which He saves a person&#8212;family heritage, job, culture, even economic status (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Recognizing this eliminates envy and resentment. The believer can say, &#8220;The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>).<p>&#8226; When change does come&#8212;promotion, relocation, marriage&#8212;it is received as a gift, not a necessity for spiritual worth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When God called him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Called&#8221; refers to God&#8217;s saving summons into fellowship with His Son (<a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; That call redefines identity: &#8220;a chosen people, a royal priesthood&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Since identity now rests in Christ, earthly categories lose ultimate significance; therefore, nothing prevents wholehearted service right where the call found us.<p>&#8226; Remaining does not limit ministry. Joseph served in prison, Daniel in exile, Lydia in business, each proving that God&#8217;s call sanctifies every setting.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/7-24.htm">1 Corinthians 7:24</a> urges believers to embrace their God-assigned setting at the moment of salvation, trusting His sovereignty, cultivating contentment, and serving Christ faithfully. Change is permissible, but obedience and joy are never postponed until circumstances shift. In Christ, every station becomes a platform for gospel witness, and every believer&#8212;brother or sister&#8212;can honor the Lord right where grace first found them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">was called.</span> Here we have an earnest reiteration of the principle underlying the previous instruction, Let the converted man abide, as regards his social or political state, as he was; in doing so, he will be with God.
