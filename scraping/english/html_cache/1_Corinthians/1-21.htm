It reflects the biblical theme that God's wisdom is far superior to human understanding (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The wisdom of God is evident in creation (<a href="/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24</a>) and in His plan of salvation, which often defies human logic. This wisdom is also seen in the mystery of the Gospel, which was hidden for ages but revealed in Christ (<a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26-27</a>).<p><b>the world through its wisdom did not know Him</b><br>Here, the "world" refers to humanity's collective understanding and philosophies that fail to recognize God. Despite the advancements in knowledge and philosophy, especially in Greek culture, human wisdom could not comprehend the nature of God or His plan (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-22</a>). This reflects the limitations of human reasoning in spiritual matters and the need for divine revelation (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p><b>God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached</b><br>This phrase underscores the paradox of the Gospel message. What is considered "foolishness" by worldly standards is actually the power of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>). The preaching of the cross, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, is the means by which God chose to reveal His salvation (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23-24</a>). This demonstrates God's pleasure in using what seems weak to shame the strong (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p><b>to save those who believe</b><br>Salvation is presented as a gift received through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). This phrase emphasizes the necessity of belief in the message of the Gospel for salvation. It aligns with the broader biblical narrative that faith, not works, is the means by which individuals are justified before God (<a href="/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>). The call to believe is universal, yet it requires a personal response to the preached word (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, a city known for its diversity and philosophical pursuits.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A Christian community in a cosmopolitan city, struggling with divisions and influenced by Greek philosophy and wisdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being whose wisdom surpasses human understanding and who orchestrates salvation through seemingly foolish means.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Refers to humanity and its systems of thought, particularly Greek philosophy, which failed to recognize God through its own wisdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preaching_of_the_gospel.htm">The Preaching of the Gospel</a></b><br>The message of Christ crucified, considered foolish by worldly standards but powerful for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_wisdom_vs._human_wisdom.htm">Divine Wisdom vs. Human Wisdom</a></b><br>God's wisdom is fundamentally different from human wisdom.

By design, human intellect cannot reach Him; instead, He gladly uses what seems foolish&#8212;simple preaching of a crucified and risen Christ&#8212;to rescue everyone who believes. The verse calls us to trust His plan, rest in His grace, and boldly share the gospel that saves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">For.</span>--This is an explanation and evidence of Low God made the wisdom of the world to be only "folly."<p><span class= "bld">After that</span> (better, <span class= "ital">inasmuch as</span>) is not here a note of time, but of causal relation.<p><span class= "bld">In the wisdom of God.</span>--These words can scarcely be taken as an expression of a kind of approval of God's wisdom in so arranging the method of revelation, but rather as referring to God's wisdom evidenced in nature, and in the teachings of lawgivers and prophets. The world by its wisdom did not attain to a knowledge of God in His wisdom displayed in creation (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm" title="And has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;">Acts 17:26</a>; <a href="/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">It</span> <span class= "bld">pleased God.</span>--The world having thus failed to gain a true knowledge of God in His wisdom, He gave them that knowledge through that very proclamation of "the cross" which those "that perish" call foolishness. The contrast so strikingly put here is between (1) the <span class= "ital">failure</span> of the world by means of its wisdom to know God, in His wisdom displayed to all in His mighty works, and to the Jews in His great teachers; and (2) the <span class= "ital">success</span> of this "folly" of the gospel, as they called it, in saving all who believed it (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the wisdom of God;</span> that is, as a part of his Divine economy.
