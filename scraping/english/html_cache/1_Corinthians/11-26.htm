The bread and the cup symbolize the body and blood of Jesus Christ, respectively. This practice was instituted by Jesus during the Last Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26-28</a>, <a href="/mark/14-22.htm">Mark 14:22-24</a>, <a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19-20</a>) and is a central rite in Christian worship. The frequency of this observance is not specified, allowing for flexibility in practice among different Christian traditions. The act of eating and drinking is a communal one, reflecting the unity of believers in Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16-17</a>).<p><b>you proclaim the Lord&#8217;s death</b><br>The act of partaking in the Lord's Supper is a proclamation of Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross. This proclamation is not merely a remembrance but a declaration of faith in the atoning work of Christ. The death of Jesus is central to Christian theology, as it is through His death that believers receive forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8-10</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>). The proclamation is both a personal and communal affirmation of the gospel message.<p><b>until He comes</b><br>This phrase points to the eschatological hope of Christ's return. The Lord's Supper is not only a remembrance of the past but also an anticipation of the future. The early church lived with the expectation of Jesus' imminent return (<a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>). This future orientation provides hope and encouragement for believers, reminding them of the promise of eternal life and the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingdom (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>).

All this being the true account of the origin of this Supper, as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup (as distinct from other bread and wine) you proclaim the Lord's death until He come. The Greek word for "ye show" is that used for making a public oral proclamation. The passage does not imply, as some have suggested, that the Lord's Supper "was a living sermon or an acted discourse," but, as is still the custom, that when the bread and wine were consecrated to this sacred use, there was an oral declaration made (perhaps in the very words the Apostle here used, <a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-22.htm" title="What? have you not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise you the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.">1Corinthians 11:22-25</a>) of the facts of the original institution. The imperative form given in the margin of the Authorised version is quite inadmissible.<p>In the pathetic words "until He come" we may find an expression of the belief, perhaps largely due to the hope, that the Second Advent was not far distant.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye do show the Lord's death.</span> The word literally means, <span class="accented">ye announce</span>, or <span class="accented">proclaim</span>, with reference to the repetition of the actual words used by our Lord.
