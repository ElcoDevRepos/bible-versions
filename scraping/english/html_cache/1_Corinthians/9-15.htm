In the cultural context of the time, it was common for teachers and philosophers to receive patronage. However, Paul chose not to exercise this right to avoid any hindrance to the Gospel. This decision reflects his commitment to self-sacrifice for the sake of the Gospel, echoing Jesus' own sacrifice (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>).<p><b>And I am not writing this to suggest that something be done for me.</b><br>Paul clarifies his intentions, emphasizing that his purpose is not to seek personal gain or support. This reflects his desire to maintain the integrity of his ministry and to ensure that his motives are not misunderstood. His approach is consistent with his teachings on contentment and reliance on God (<a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a>).<p><b>Indeed, I would rather die than let anyone nullify my boast.</b><br>Paul's "boast" refers to his ability to preach the Gospel free of charge, which he sees as a testament to his dedication and sincerity. In a historical context, boasting was often associated with honor and reputation. Paul&#8217;s statement underscores the seriousness with which he views his mission and his willingness to endure hardship for the sake of the Gospel. This reflects the sacrificial nature of Christ, who laid down His life for others (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth.

Yet he immediately says he has declined them.<p>&#8226; This is not false humility; it is deliberate strategy. By supporting himself, Paul removes every excuse someone might raise against the gospel (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>).<p>&#8226; His pattern is consistent: &#8220;We worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; see also <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>, <a href="/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33-35</a>).<p>&#8226; The choice illustrates a larger principle: believers may gladly surrender personal privileges when it helps others see Christ more clearly (compare <a href="/1_corinthians/8-13.htm">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I am not writing this to suggest that something be done for me</b><p>Paul anticipates misunderstanding. He is not dropping hints for financial help.<p>&#8226; His motive is transparent: &#8220;I will not be a burden to you, because I do not want your possessions, but you&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14</a>).<p>&#8226; He refuses to exploit the church through intermediaries (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-17.htm">2 Corinthians 12:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Like his Lord, he serves &#8220;not for dishonest gain, but eager to serve&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Even when he does receive gifts from other churches, his joy is not the gift itself but the spiritual fruit it represents in the givers (<a href="/philippians/4-17.htm">Philippians 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Indeed, I would rather die than let anyone nullify my boast</b><p>Paul&#8217;s &#8220;boast&#8221; is not self-promotion; it is the privilege of offering the gospel free of charge (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-18.htm">1 Corinthians 9:18</a>).<p>&#8226; He would rather face death than see that testimony undermined.<p>&#8226; The boast ultimately rests in the Lord: &#8220;Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-17.htm">2 Corinthians 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226; By refusing payment, Paul dramatizes the cross&#8212;salvation comes without cost to the recipient, though at great cost to the giver (<a href="/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a>).<p>&#8226; His stand challenges believers to ask what rights we might relinquish so nothing hinders others from receiving Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/9-15.htm">1 Corinthians 9:15</a> shows Paul gladly surrendering legitimate rights to keep the spotlight on Jesus. He wants nothing&#8212;money, expectation, or misunderstanding&#8212;to blur the free offer of the gospel. His example invites us to hold our own privileges loosely so the message of Christ shines without obstruction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">But I.</span>--Again, after the assertion of the right, we have the statement that though he had vindicated the right by the highest and unquestionable authority of Christ Himself, the Apostle had not seen fit to avail himself of it.<p><span class= "bld">Neither have I written these things.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">neither am I writing.</span> The Apostle in these words carefully guards against the possibility of their taking these arguments used here as an indication of any intention on his part to give up now the independent position which he had hitherto assumed.<p><span class= "bld">It were better for me to die.</span>--The meaning of these words is evidently that the Apostle would rather die than make void his right to boast or glory in his unremunerated work in the Church--which would be the case if he now or ever condescended to receive, as others did, any support from them. There is, however, a great variety of readings as to the actual mode of expression of this thought. One suggestion is that the words may read thus:--"It were better for me to die than (receive reward from you); no man shall make my ground of boasting void." Another is; "It were better for me to die, rather than any one should make my ground of boasting void." There is great weight in favour of both of these readings. The following have also been suggested as possible readings of the passage:--"It were better for me to die than that my ground of boasting should die; no one shall make it void;" and "It were better for me to die than that my ground of boasting ----; no man shall make it void." In this last case the Apostle pauses in the middle of his impassioned declaration, and leaves the sentence unfinished, as he flings aside the thought that his ground of boasting could be removed, and exclaims earnestly and emphatically, "No man <span class= "ital">shall</span> make it void." Perhaps, on the whole, especially having regard to the character of the writer, this last rendering is most likely to be the true one. In any case, the general drift and meaning of the passage is the same. The Apostle would rather die than lose his ground of boasting, and he boldly asserts his determination to let no one deprive him of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-23.</span> - <span class="accented">Self denying ordinance of St. Paul.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have used none of these things</span>.
