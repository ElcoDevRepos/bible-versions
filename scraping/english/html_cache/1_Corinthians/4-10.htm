In the Greco-Roman world, wisdom was highly valued, and the message of the cross was seen as foolishness (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>). Paul embraces this "foolishness" as a badge of honor, aligning with Christ's teachings that often subvert worldly wisdom (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>). The apostles' willingness to be seen as fools reflects their commitment to the Gospel, echoing Jesus' own rejection by the world (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-19</a>).<p><b>but you are wise in Christ</b><br>The Corinthians considered themselves wise, possibly due to their spiritual gifts and knowledge (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5, 8</a>:1). Paul challenges this self-assessment, suggesting that true wisdom is found in humility and service, as exemplified by Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>). This phrase highlights the tension between worldly wisdom and spiritual wisdom, a recurring theme in Paul's letters (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-18.htm">1 Corinthians 3:18-19</a>).<p><b>We are weak</b><br>Paul acknowledges the apostles' physical and social vulnerabilities, which contrast with the Corinthians' perceived strength. This weakness is not a flaw but a reflection of Christ's own path, who "was crucified in weakness" (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>). The apostles' weakness serves to demonstrate God's power, as His strength is made perfect in weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>).<p><b>but you are strong</b><br>The Corinthians' sense of strength may stem from their social status or spiritual gifts. Paul uses this contrast to highlight their misunderstanding of true strength, which is found in dependence on God (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>). This strength is not self-derived but comes from abiding in Christ (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p><b>You are honored</b><br>The Corinthians enjoyed a level of social honor and status, possibly due to their wealth or influence within the church. Paul contrasts this with the apostles' experience of dishonor, reflecting Jesus' teaching that the last will be first (<a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>). This honor is superficial compared to the eternal honor that comes from God (<a href="/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7</a>).<p><b>but we are dishonored</b><br>The apostles faced persecution and rejection, mirroring Christ's own experience (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). This dishonor is a mark of their faithfulness to the Gospel, as they share in Christ's sufferings (<a href="/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29</a>). The apostles' willingness to endure dishonor for the sake of Christ serves as a model for believers, emphasizing the eternal reward over temporary status (<a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

The Corinthians thought themselves spiritually sophisticated (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-18.htm">1 Corinthians 3:18</a>), yet their pride exposed how little they understood the servant-heart of Jesus (<a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43-45</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine wisdom&#8212;&#8220;Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>)&#8212;produces humility (<a href="/james/3-13.htm">James 3:13</a>).

When believers boast in their own abilities, they undercut the very power they claim to possess (<a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul longs for them to experience authentic strength&#8212;&#8220;when I am weak, then I am strong&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-10.htm">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are honored</b><p>&#8220;You are honored&#8221;<p>&#8226; The church enjoyed social favor in Corinth, a city that prized status. They were tempted to protect that esteem rather than identify with a scorned apostle (<a href="/john/12-43.htm">John 12:43</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture cautions that friendship with the world can dull friendship with God (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul reminds them that honor before people is fleeting (<a href="/luke/6-26.htm">Luke 6:26</a>); true honor comes from the Father (<a href="/john/5-44.htm">John 5:44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but we are dishonored</b><p>&#8220;but we are dishonored&#8221;<p>&#8226; Paul and his co-workers endure contempt, yet they carry on joyfully (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-8.htm">2 Corinthians 6:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Like the prophets before them (<a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11-12</a>) and Christ Himself (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2-3</a>), they accept disgrace as part of faithful ministry.<p>&#8226; Their dishonor exposes the upside-down kingdom where &#8220;the last will be first&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>) and where eternal glory outweighs momentary shame (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul contrasts his own suffering, weakness, and social scorn with the Corinthians&#8217; self-assured sense of wisdom, strength, and honor. Using gentle irony, he calls the church back to the gospel&#8217;s pattern: embrace the world&#8217;s verdict of &#8220;foolishness,&#8221; rely on God&#8217;s power in weakness, and seek eternal honor rather than temporary applause. In doing so, believers reflect the very heart of Christ, who humbled Himself for our salvation and now invites us to follow Him on the same path.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">We are fools.</span>--This verse is charged with irony.
