This reflects the early Christian understanding of the church as a family, transcending social and cultural divisions.<p><b>I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit,</b><br>Paul uses himself and Apollos as examples to illustrate his teachings. Apollos was a well-respected teacher in the early church (<a href="/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24-28</a>), and by including him, Paul underscores the importance of humility and unity among church leaders. This approach is meant to serve the Corinthian believers, helping them understand the principles of humility and service.<p><b>so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes adherence to Scripture as the ultimate authority. The early church faced challenges with false teachings and divisions, and Paul stresses the importance of staying grounded in the Word. This principle is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>, which highlights the sufficiency of Scripture for teaching and correction.<p><b>Then you will not take pride in one man over another.</b><br>Paul addresses the issue of factionalism within the Corinthian church, where believers were aligning themselves with different leaders (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>). By focusing on Scripture and the example of humble leadership, Paul aims to eliminate pride and division.

He only mentioned himself and Apollos (and not the other heads of parties), so that his motive in rebuking this schismatic spirit may not be misunderstood--which possibly it might have been had he written strongly and directly regarding Cephas and his admirers--and that those who read the Epistle might learn a lesson of humility. All that was said in condemnation of the spirit which exalted the Apostle and Apollos into party leaders, would apply with equal or greater force to all others; for they, as the planter and the waterer of the Corinthian vineyard, the layer of the foundation and the builder up of the Corinthian spiritual temple, were certainly the two whose exaltation by their followers might have seemed most pardonable.<p><span class= "bld">That ye might learn in us . . .</span><span class= "ital">--i.e.,</span> "by our examples" you should learn not to go beyond what is written in the Scriptures--not to be found in any one particular passage, but in the general tone and scope of the Old Testament writings, which ever ascribe glory to God alone (as found in the passages referred to in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.">1Corinthians 1:19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm" title="That, according as it is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.">1Corinthians 1:31</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-19.htm" title="For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.">1Corinthians 3:19</a>)--that none of you be puffed up on behalf of one (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Apollos) against another (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Paul), and <span class= "ital">vice versa.</span> The Apostle here touches on the fact that this exaltation of teachers was really a gratification of their own pride. It was not that they "puffed up" the teacher, but themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-13.</span> - <span class="accented">Contrast between the inflated self sufficiency of the Corinthians and the earthly humiliation of the apostles.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brethren</span>. The occasional use of this and similar expressions ("beloved," etc.) often serves to strengthen an appeal, or, as here, to soften the sternness of a rebuke. <span class="cmt_word">I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos.</span> The meaning seems to be that St. Paul has prominently transferred to himself and to Apollos, or rather to the parties who chose their names as watchwords, the proof as to the sin and futility of partisanship which applied equally well to the parties which ranged themselves under other names. (For the verb "transfer" - more often "transform" see <a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13, 14, 15</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>.) He abstains purposely and generously from publicly naming the fuglemen of the antagonistic factions. <span class="cmt_word">For your sakes.</span> By rebuking party spirit in his own partisans and those of the teacher who was most closely allied to himself, he robbed his remarks of all semblance of personality or bitterness. It showed his generous delicacy not to allude rather to the adherents of Cephas and the Judaean emissary. <span class="cmt_word">Than ye might learn in us.</span> I made Apollos and myself instances of the undesirability of over exalting human teachers, that by our case you might learn the general principle. <span class="cmt_word">Not to think of men above that which is written.</span> The true reading is merely, <span class="accented">not above the things which have</span> been <span class="accented">written</span>, as though the words were a sort of proverb, like <span class="accented">Ne quid nimis</span> or Milton's "The rule of not too much" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The word "to think" is omitted in the best manuscripts. The phrase, "which have been written," is of very uncertain meaning. It may refer generally to "the scriptural rule" that all boasting is wrong (<a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23</a>), or to the humble estimate of teachers which he has just been writing down for them. All his Old Testament quotations so far (ch. 1:19, 31; 3:19) have referred to humility. Some see in it a reference to <a href="/matthew/23-8.htm">Matthew 23:8</a> "Be not ye called Babbi;" but it is uncertain whether St. Matthew's Gospel was yet written; and St. Paul never refers so directly to any written Gospel. Perhaps it is a sort of proverb," Keep always to strict evidence;" "Say nothing which cannot be proved in black and white." The text, like so many others, has only a very remote connection with the sense in which it is usually quoted. <span class="cmt_word">That no one of you he puffed up.</span> St. Paul was painfully impressed by this <span class="accented">inflation</span> of the Corinthians, and he often recurs to this word as a description of their vain conceit (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-18.htm">1 Corinthians 4:18, 19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>). In other Epistles the word is only found once (in <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For one against another.</span> The expression is a profound one. The glorying in men (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>), undesirable in any circumstances, becomes the more pernicious because the exaltation of one set of teachers is almost invariably accompanied by mean and unjust depreciation of any who could be supposed to be their rivals. The Corinthian who was "for Cephas" would be almost certain to be, to some extent, "<span class="accented">against</span> Paul." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Brothers,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(adelphoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_80.htm">Strong's 80: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brother, member of the same religious community, especially a fellow-Christian.
