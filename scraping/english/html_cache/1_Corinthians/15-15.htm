The term "false witnesses" refers to the serious accusation of bearing false testimony, which is condemned in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). In Jewish law, false testimony was a grave offense, punishable by the same penalty that would have been given to the accused if the false testimony had been believed (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-16.htm">Deuteronomy 19:16-19</a>). Paul is underscoring the integrity of the apostles' witness, which is foundational to the Christian faith. The resurrection is not just a theological point but a historical claim that the apostles have staked their credibility on.<p><b>For we have testified about God that He raised Christ from the dead,</b><br>The resurrection of Christ is central to the gospel message (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>). The apostles' testimony is rooted in their firsthand experiences, as they were eyewitnesses to the risen Christ (<a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32, 1</a> <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>). This testimony is consistent with Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>, which foretell the Messiah's resurrection. The resurrection is also a demonstration of God's power and a validation of Jesus' divine nature (<a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>). The phrase "raised Christ from the dead" affirms the belief in bodily resurrection, distinguishing it from Greek philosophical ideas of the soul's immortality.<p><b>but He did not raise Him if in fact the dead are not raised.</b><br>Paul is addressing a theological error in Corinth, where some denied the resurrection of the dead (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-12.htm">1 Corinthians 15:12</a>). This denial likely stemmed from Greek philosophical influences, which often viewed the physical body as inferior to the spiritual. Paul argues that if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ Himself could not have been raised, which would nullify the entire Christian faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14, 17</a>). The resurrection is a cornerstone of Christian hope, promising believers a future resurrection and eternal life (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-18</a>). This statement also highlights the interconnectedness of Christ's resurrection with the general resurrection, affirming the eschatological hope found in passages like <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> and <a href="/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28-29</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, emphasizing the importance of the resurrection of Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and cultural influences, where the early Christian church faced various doctrinal challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection_of_christ.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a></b><br>The central event in Christian faith, affirming Jesus' victory over death and the promise of eternal life for believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_witnesses.htm">False Witnesses</a></b><br>Refers to those who would be lying about God if the resurrection were not true, highlighting the seriousness of the claim.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in the testimony, whose power and truth are affirmed through the resurrection of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_centrality_of_the_resurrection.htm">The Centrality of the Resurrection</a></b><br>The resurrection is foundational to Christian faith.
