The imagery of placing something under one's feet is a common biblical metaphor for subjugation and authority, seen in <a href="/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>, where defeated kings are placed under the feet of the Israelites. This phrase emphasizes Christ's victory over sin and death, a central theme in <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>, which discusses the resurrection. Theologically, it underscores the fulfillment of God's plan through Christ, who is the second Adam, restoring what was lost through the first Adam.<p><b>Now when it says that everything has been put under Him,</b><br>This part of the verse clarifies the extent of Christ's dominion. The use of "everything" indicates the comprehensive nature of Christ's authority, which includes all spiritual and earthly powers. This is consistent with <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>, where Christ is described as the head over all things for the church. The phrase also reflects the eschatological hope that all things will be reconciled under Christ, as seen in <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>. Historically, this assertion would have been radical in a Greco-Roman context, where multiple deities were believed to have control over different aspects of life.<p><b>this clearly does not include the One who put everything under Him.</b><br>This phrase distinguishes between God the Father and God the Son, maintaining the hierarchy within the Trinity while affirming the deity of Christ. It reflects the subordination of the Son to the Father in terms of role and function, not essence or nature, as seen in <a href="/john/14-28.htm">John 14:28</a>, where Jesus says, "The Father is greater than I." This distinction is crucial for understanding the relationship within the Godhead and the execution of the divine plan of salvation. Theologically, it affirms the monotheistic belief central to both Jewish and Christian doctrine, ensuring that the supremacy of God the Father is upheld even as Christ is exalted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who has ultimate authority and power over all creation.

Just prior to verse 27 he says, &#8220;Then the end will come, when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father, after He has destroyed every ruler and every authority and power&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>). The flow shows:<p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s resurrection is the firstfruits (15:20).<p>&#8226; His current reign is progressive&#8212;He &#8220;must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet&#8221; (15:25), echoing <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>.<p>&#8226; The final enemy, death, will be abolished (15:26; cf. <a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>).<p>Verse 27 therefore sits in a paragraph that outlines the unfolding triumph of Jesus from resurrection morning to the new heavens and earth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God has put everything under His feet</b><p>&#8220;For &#8216;God has put everything under His feet.&#8217;&#8221; Paul cites <a href="/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>, originally about humanity&#8217;s intended dominion but perfectly fulfilled in Jesus, the Last Adam (cf. <a href="/hebrews/2-6.htm">Hebrews 2:6-9</a>). By raising and exalting the Son, the Father:<p>&#8226; Grants Him unrivaled authority over every created thing&#8212;angels, demons, rulers, natural forces (<a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Guarantees the complete subjugation of all enemies, culminating in the resurrection of believers and the destruction of death itself (<a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Affirms messianic prophecy that the Christ would reign not merely spiritually but in concrete, universal lordship (<a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The exception: the One who put everything under Him</b><p>&#8220;Now when it says that everything has been put under Him, this clearly does not include the One who put everything under Him.&#8221; Paul clarifies the scope of &#8220;everything&#8221; so no reader thinks the Son replaces or eclipses the Father. Key points:<p>&#8226; Functional order, not inferiority: the Son eternally shares the Father&#8217;s divine nature (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; 10:30), yet willingly submits in redemptive history (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Harmony within the Godhead: the Father glorifies the Son, and the Son glorifies the Father (<a href="/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1-5</a>).

Yet the verse carefully preserves the Father&#8217;s unique position as the One who installs the Son as King, ensuring that at the consummation the perfect harmony of the Godhead shines forth and &#8220;God may be all in all.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">For he hath put all things under his feet.</span>--<a href="/1_corinthians/15-26.htm" title="The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.">1Corinthians 15:26</a> is a parenthesis, and the "for" with which this verse commences goes back to <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1Corinthians 15:25</a>. The connection is, Christ must reign until he has put all enemies under his feet. Christ must triumph, <span class= "ital">for</span> according to the statement in <a href="/psalms/8-6.htm" title="You made him to have dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet:">Psalm 8:6</a> (see also <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a>), God hath put all things under man, and in a higher sense under the Son of Man. (For a similar application of Old Testament statement regarding man to Christ as the Son of Man, see <a href="/matthew/21-16.htm" title="And said to him, Hear you what these say? And Jesus said to them, Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have perfected praise?">Matthew 21:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-7.htm" title="You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:">Hebrews 2:7</a>.) But when God says that all things are put under Him, He evidently is excepted who did put all things under Him. This leads up logically to the complete triumph of God the Father, expressed in the following verse, which is an expansion of <a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24</a>, on which see Note there. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when he saith.</span> The "he" refers to God.
