In the biblical context, Paul is writing to the Corinthians from Ephesus, a major city in Asia Minor known for its commerce and the Temple of Artemis. The "great door" symbolizes a divinely provided opportunity for spreading the Gospel. This metaphor of an open door is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a> and <a href="/revelation/3-8.htm">Revelation 3:8</a>, to describe opportunities for ministry. The effectiveness of this work is underscored by the growth of the early church in Ephesus, as recorded in <a href="/acts/19.htm">Acts 19</a>, where many were converted, and the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.<p><b>even though many oppose me</b><br>Despite the opportunity, Paul acknowledges significant opposition. This opposition likely came from various sources, including local Jewish leaders, pagan worshippers, and craftsmen who profited from the sale of idols, as seen in <a href="/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23-41</a>. The cultural and religious climate of Ephesus was hostile to the message of Christ, which threatened established economic and religious systems. This opposition is a recurring theme in Paul's ministry, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>, where he lists the hardships he faced. The presence of opposition, however, often signifies the importance and potential impact of the work being done, as seen in the life of Jesus Christ, who faced constant opposition yet fulfilled His mission. This phrase encourages believers to persevere in their calling, trusting that God&#8217;s purposes will prevail despite resistance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth.

He gives his reason in verse 9: &#8220;because a great door for effective work has opened to me, even though many oppose me&#8221;. Luke records the incredible fruit of Paul&#8217;s stay in Ephesus&#8212;daily teaching, miracles, and the spread of the gospel throughout Asia Minor (<a href="/acts/19-8.htm">Acts 19:8-10, 20</a>). Against that backdrop, each phrase in verse 9 becomes vivid and practical.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A great door</b><p>&#8226; In Scripture a &#8220;door&#8221; pictures God-given opportunity. The Lord opened a door of faith for Gentiles in Antioch of Pisidia and Iconium (<a href="/acts/14-27.htm">Acts 14:27</a>), for gospel preaching at Troas (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>), and promises an open door the world cannot shut (<a href="/revelation/3-8.htm">Revelation 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul sees Ephesus in exactly that way: God Himself has swung the door wide. Nothing accidental, no mere coincidence&#8212;God is sovereignly at work.<p>&#8226; When He opens a door, believers are to recognize it and step through, trusting His timing and power (<a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For effective work</b><p>&#8226; The opportunity is not vague; it is &#8220;effective.&#8221; Real people will hear, repent, believe, and grow. That is the measuring stick for ministry (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Ephesus proves it: two years of daily discussion in the lecture hall of Tyrannus result in &#8220;all who lived in Asia&#8221; hearing the word of the Lord (<a href="/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God still couples open doors with fruitful labor. The Word is &#8220;not chained&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>). When He calls us to serve&#8212;teaching a class, witnessing at work, raising children in truth&#8212;He intends results for His glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Has opened to me</b><p>&#8226; Paul personalizes the opportunity. The same God who opened Lydia&#8217;s heart (<a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14</a>) opened this door specifically to Paul.<p>&#8226; Calling is not abstract. Like Jeremiah with a fire in his bones (<a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>) or Esther set in position &#8220;for such a time as this&#8221; (<a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>), we each receive assignments tailored by our Lord.<p>&#8226; Recognizing God&#8217;s personal hand breeds confidence. Paul can stay put, invest deeply, and not second-guess, because God Himself initiated the work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even though many oppose me</b><p>&#8226; The open door does not cancel opposition. In Ephesus, Paul faces entrenched idolatry, public ridicule, and a city-wide riot led by Demetrius the silversmith (<a href="/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23-41</a>).<p>&#8226; Opposition is normal for gospel advance. Jesus promised His followers tribulation (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>) and taught that persecution accompanies obedience (<a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Rather than discouraging Paul, resistance confirms he is on the right path (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, believers should expect pushback&#8212;spiritual, relational, cultural&#8212;whenever God opens a door. Faithfulness means pressing on, not retreating.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s words in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a> capture a timeless ministry pattern: God sovereignly opens wide, fruitful opportunities; He assigns them personally; and He allows opposition to sharpen faith and showcase His power. When we see such a door, we step through it with courage, labor diligently for lasting fruit, and endure resistance with unwavering trust that the Lord who opened the door will keep it open until His purposes are complete.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A great door and effectual.</span> A wide and promising opportunity for winning souls to God.
