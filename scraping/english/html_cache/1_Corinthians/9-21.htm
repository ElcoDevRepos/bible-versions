In the first-century context, Gentiles were often seen as pagans or idolaters by the Jewish people. Paul, a Jew, is emphasizing his mission to reach those outside the Jewish faith. This reflects the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations, indicating the inclusivity of the Gospel.<p><b>I became like one without the law</b><br>Paul adapted his approach to connect with Gentiles, not adhering to Jewish customs that were unnecessary for them. This adaptability is seen in <a href="/acts/17-22.htm">Acts 17:22-31</a>, where Paul addresses the Athenians using their cultural context. His flexibility in ministry demonstrates the principle of becoming "all things to all people" (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>) to share the Gospel effectively.<p><b>(though I am not outside the law of God but am under the law of Christ)</b><br>Paul clarifies that his freedom from the Mosaic Law does not mean he is lawless. The "law of Christ" refers to the teachings and commandments of Jesus, emphasizing love and grace (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>). This distinction highlights the transition from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant, where the focus is on internal transformation rather than external adherence.<p><b>to win those without the law</b><br>Paul's ultimate goal is evangelism and the salvation of souls. His strategy is to remove barriers that might prevent Gentiles from accepting the Gospel. This aligns with Jesus' mission to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>) and reflects the heart of God for all people to come to repentance (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, explaining his approach to evangelism and his adaptability in reaching different groups of people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>A diverse and often divided early Christian community in Corinth, a major city in ancient Greece, known for its cultural and religious plurality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles ("those without the law")</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who did not follow the Mosaic Law, representing a significant portion of Paul's missionary focus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_of_god.htm">The Law of God</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law given to the Israelites, which Paul acknowledges but distinguishes from the "law of Christ."<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_of_christ.htm">The Law of Christ</a></b><br>A term used by Paul to describe the guiding principles of Christian life, centered on love and the teachings of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/adaptability_in_evangelism.htm">Adaptability in Evangelism</a></b><br>Paul demonstrates the importance of cultural sensitivity and adaptability in sharing the Gospel.

St. Paul adapted himself to their habits and mode of thought when necessary. He quoted from their literature (<a href="/acts/17-28.htm" title="For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.">Acts 17:28</a>); he based an argument on the inscriptions on their altars (<a href="/acts/17-23.htm" title="For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him declare I to you.">Acts 17:23</a>); and he did not require them to adopt Jewish ceremonies (<a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11</a>). The parenthesis explains in what sense only St. Paul was "without" the Law, so as to prevent the possibility of this statement being used as a justification of lawlessness. As being one with Christ, he was indeed under the law of God as revealed in the person, work, and teaching of the Lord. (See <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm" title="Bear you one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.">Galatians 6:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To them that are without law, as without law.</span> In other words, I so far became to the heathen as a heathen (<a href="/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12</a>), that I never wilfully insulted their beliefs (Acts 19:87) nor shocked their prejudices, but on the contrary, judged them with perfect forbearance (<a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>) and treated them with invariable courtesy. St, Paul tried to look at every subject, so far as he could do so innocently, from 'their point of view (<a href="/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>.). He defended their gospel liberty, and had intercourse with Gentile converts on terms of perfect equality (<a href="/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not without law to God.</span> Not even "without law" (<span class="accented">anomos</span>) Much less "opposed to law" (<span class="accented">antiheroes</span>), though free from it as a bondage (<a href="/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a>). The need for this qualification is shown by the fact that in the Clementine writings, in the spurious letter of Peter to James, St. Paul is surreptitiously calumniated as <span class="accented">"the lawless one</span>." Even the Gentiles were "not without law to God" (<a href="/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14, 15</a>).
