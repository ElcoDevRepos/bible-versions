In the context of the Corinthian church, Paul addresses issues of division and improper conduct during the Lord's Supper. The call to self-examination is a directive to assess one's spiritual state and motives. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of repentance and self-assessment found in passages like <a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23-24</a>, where David asks God to search his heart. The Greek word for "examine" (&#948;&#959;&#954;&#953;&#956;&#940;&#950;&#969;) implies testing or proving one's worthiness, similar to how metals are tested for purity. This self-examination is not merely introspective but is meant to lead to repentance and reconciliation with God and others.<p><b>before he eats of the bread</b><br>The bread symbolizes the body of Christ, broken for believers. In the cultural context of the early church, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and unity. The bread used in the Lord's Supper is a reminder of Jesus' sacrifice, as instituted during the Last Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26</a>). The act of eating the bread is not just a ritual but a profound act of remembrance and proclamation of faith. The bread also connects to the manna provided in the wilderness (Exodus 16), symbolizing God's provision and sustenance.<p><b>and drinks of the cup</b><br>The cup represents the new covenant in Christ's blood, shed for the forgiveness of sins (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>). In the ancient Near East, covenants were often ratified with a shared meal or drink, signifying agreement and commitment. The cup in the Lord's Supper signifies the believer's participation in the benefits of Christ's atoning death. It also points to the eschatological hope of the Messianic banquet (<a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6-9</a>), where believers will dine with Christ in His kingdom. The act of drinking the cup is a declaration of faith in the redemptive work of Jesus and a commitment to live in accordance with His teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on proper conduct during the Lord's Supper.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often divided early Christian community facing issues of unity and proper worship practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_supper.htm">The Lord's Supper</a></b><br>A sacred Christian rite commemorating Jesus' Last Supper with His disciples, involving the eating of bread and drinking of wine as symbols of His body and blood.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_self-examination.htm">The Importance of Self-Examination</a></b><br>Before participating in the Lord's Supper, believers are called to introspect and assess their spiritual state.
