In the context of 1 Corinthians, Paul is writing to a church struggling with divisions and issues of conscience, particularly concerning food offered to idols. The Corinthian believers prided themselves on their knowledge, but Paul warns against overestimating one's understanding. This echoes <a href="/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a>, "Do not be wise in your own eyes," emphasizing humility. The cultural context of Corinth, a city known for its intellectualism and philosophical debates, would have made this warning particularly relevant.<p><b>does not yet know</b><br>Here, Paul suggests that true knowledge is not merely intellectual but involves a deeper, spiritual understanding. This aligns with the biblical theme that wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The Greek word for "know" (gin&#333;sk&#333;) implies an ongoing process of learning and understanding, rather than a completed state. This reflects the Christian journey of continual growth in faith and knowledge of God, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a>, "But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."<p><b>as he ought to know</b><br>This phrase indicates that there is a proper way to know, which involves humility and love. Paul contrasts mere intellectual knowledge with the love that builds up (<a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>). The "ought" suggests a moral obligation to pursue knowledge that edifies and serves others, rather than puffing up oneself. This is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized love as the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>). The proper knowledge is relational and transformative, leading to a deeper relationship with God and others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

The issue is not knowledge itself, but the person &#8220;who thinks&#8221; he possesses it. Scripture warns that self-confidence can blind us to reality. <a href="/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a> says, &#8220;Do not be wise in your own eyes,&#8221; and <a href="/galatians/6-3.htm">Galatians 6:3</a> cautions, &#8220;If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself&#8221;. In <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a> Paul has already noted, &#8220;Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.&#8221; The thought life must be submitted to Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>); otherwise, thinking becomes the breeding ground for spiritual pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he knows something</b><p>The phrase recognizes that believers may indeed have correct information&#8212;about idols, food sacrificed to them, or any other doctrinal point. Yet knowledge, even accurate knowledge, can become a badge of superiority. Paul later writes, &#8220;If I have&#8230;all knowledge, but do not have love, I am nothing&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>). <a href="/romans/14-14.htm">Romans 14:14</a> shows how one may be &#8220;convinced in the Lord Jesus&#8221; about a matter of conscience, but that conviction must still consider weaker brothers. Genuine knowledge never stands isolated; it is accountable to love.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>does not yet know</b><p>Here Paul punctures the bubble of arrogance. However much we have learned, our understanding remains partial. &#8220;For we know in part and we prophesy in part&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-9.htm">1 Corinthians 13:9</a>). <a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a> reminds us that &#8220;the hidden things belong to the Lord our God.&#8221; Even the most mature believer is a student in Christ&#8217;s school. This awareness guards against judging others&#8217; liberty (<a href="/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10</a>) and fuels continual dependence on the Spirit, who &#8220;will guide you into all truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as he ought to know</b><p>There is a right way to know: humbly, lovingly, and in relationship with God. Verse 3 continues, &#8220;But the one who loves God is known by God.&#8221; True knowledge is relational, not merely informational. <a href="/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a> contrasts &#8220;the wisdom from above&#8221; with earthly wisdom, describing it as &#8220;pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits&#8221;. First <a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7-8</a> ties knowledge to love, declaring that &#8220;whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.&#8221; The believer who &#8220;ought to know&#8221; seeks to build up others, not to parade insight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_corinthians/8-2.htm">1 Corinthians 8:2</a> warns that thinking we have knowledge can itself reveal ignorance. God-honoring knowledge is always humble, incomplete on this side of glory, and inseparably joined to love. As we grow in biblical understanding, we hold truth with an open hand, recognizing our dependence on the Lord and our responsibility to edify His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">If any man think that he knoweth any thing . . . .</span>--There must be a moral as well as a merely intellectual element in knowledge if it is to be true knowledge. Without love to guide us in its use it is not an operative knowledge, and so does not fulfil the true end of knowledge.<p>It has been suggested (Stanley <span class= "ital">in loc</span>) that "not yet" has here the force of "not in the infirmities of their mortal state;" but such an interpretation introduces altogether a new element of thought, to which there is no antithetical explanation in what follows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If any man think that he knoweth anything.</span> Humility is the test of true knowledge, and love the inevitable factor in all Christian knowledge. The conceit of knowledge is usually the usurped self assertion of an imaginary infallibility.
