The Greek word used here, "porneia," encompasses a wide range of illicit sexual activities. The cultural backdrop of Corinth, with its temple to Aphrodite and associated temple prostitution, highlights the challenges early Christians faced in maintaining sexual purity. This phrase underscores the need for a counter-cultural stance on sexual ethics, aligning with biblical teachings found in passages like <a href="/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</a>, which call for holiness and sanctification.<p><b>each man should have his own wife</b><br>Paul advocates for monogamous marriage as a safeguard against sexual immorality. This directive aligns with the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where a man is united with his wife, forming a one-flesh union. The emphasis on "his own wife" suggests exclusivity and fidelity, countering the polygamous practices seen in some Old Testament figures and the promiscuity prevalent in Corinthian society. This teaching reflects the sanctity of marriage as instituted by God and reiterated by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>.<p><b>and each woman her own husband</b><br>Similarly, Paul emphasizes the mutual responsibility and exclusivity in marriage for women. This reflects the egalitarian nature of Christian marriage, where both husband and wife are called to faithfulness. In a patriarchal society, this statement affirms the dignity and agency of women within the marital relationship. The reciprocal nature of this command is further supported by <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>, where Paul describes the mutual love and respect required in a Christian marriage, mirroring the relationship between Christ and the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance on marriage and sexual morality.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece known for its diverse culture and prevalent immorality, which influenced the church's challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, struggling with issues of sexual immorality and seeking guidance on Christian living.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>The institution Paul refers to as a remedy for sexual immorality, emphasizing the union between one man and one woman.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sexual_immorality.htm">Sexual Immorality</a></b><br>A significant issue in Corinth, prompting Paul to address the need for marital fidelity and purity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_marriage.htm">The Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is a sacred institution ordained by God, designed to provide companionship and a legitimate context for sexual relations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_sexual_immorality.htm">Guarding Against Sexual Immorality</a></b><br>In a world rife with sexual immorality, Christians are called to uphold the sanctity of marriage as a safeguard against sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/mutual_responsibility_in_marriage.htm">Mutual Responsibility in Marriage</a></b><br>Both husband and wife have responsibilities to each other, emphasizing mutual respect, love, and fidelity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/marriage_as_a_reflection_of_christ_and_the_church.htm">Marriage as a Reflection of Christ and the Church</a></b><br>The marital relationship is a reflection of Christ's relationship with the church, calling for selfless love and commitment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_steps_for_purity.htm">Practical Steps for Purity</a></b><br>Christians should take practical steps to maintain purity, such as setting boundaries, seeking accountability, and prioritizing their relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_7_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 7:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_7_2_on_sexual_immorality.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 7:2 address the issue of sexual immorality?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Marriage_implies_monogamy.htm">What does "each man should have his own wife" imply about marriage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_7_2_s_role_in_marital_fidelity_today.htm">How can 1 Corinthians 7:2 guide Christians in maintaining marital fidelity today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_2_24_vs_1_Corinthians_7_2_link.htm">How does Genesis 2:24 relate to the teachings in 1 Corinthians 7:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_couples_live_1_Corinthians_7_2.htm">In what ways can married couples apply 1 Corinthians 7:2 in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_7_2_Is_marriage_needed_to_avoid_sin.htm">What does 1 Corinthians 7:2 imply about the necessity of marriage for avoiding immorality?

St. Paul gives a reason why those who wrote to him should marry, and the force of the argument does not extend beyond the immediate object in view. St. Paul's view of the higher aspects of matrimony are fully set forth when he treats of that subject generally (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="/romans/7-4.htm" title="Why, my brothers, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.">Romans 7:4</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/5-25.htm" title="Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;">Ephesians 5:25-32</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless</span>. In this single word St. Paul practically refutes all the dangerous and unwarrantable inferences drawn by St. Jerome and others from the previous clause. St. Jerome argues: "If it is good for a man not to touch a woman, it must be bad to do so, and therefore celibacy is a holier state than marriage." He also says, "I suspect the goodness of a thing which the greatness of another evil enforces as a lesser evil." Such reasoning shows: <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The danger of pressing words to the full extent of the logical inferences which may be deduced from them. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The errors which always arise from arguing upon isolated texts dissevered from their context, and from all consideration of the circumstances under which they were written. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The necessity of following the guidance of the Holy Spirit when he shows, by history and experience, the need for altering precepts with reference to altered conditions. There is in celibacy a moral beauty - it is <span class="accented">kalon</span>; there are cases in which it becomes a duty. But in most cases marriage, being no less a duty, as St. Paul proceeds to show, is even fairer and more excellent. Neither state, the wedded or the unwedded, is in itself more holy than the other. Each has its own honour and loveliness, and can only be judged of in connection with surrounding circumstances. Those who make St. Paul judge slightingly of marriage contradict his own express rules and statements (<a href="/ephesians/5-24.htm">Ephesians 5:24, 31, 32</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-15.htm">1 Timothy 2:15</a>), and make him speak the current heathen language of heathen epicures, who, to the great injury of morals, treated marriage as a disagreeable necessity, which was, if possible, to be avoided. If the "it is a good thing" of St. Paul in ver. 1 were to be taken absolutely, it would have to be corrected  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_corinthians/7-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[there is so much]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8048;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
