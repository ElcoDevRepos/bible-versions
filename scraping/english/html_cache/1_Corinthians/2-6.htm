In the context of 1 Corinthians, maturity refers to a deeper understanding and acceptance of spiritual truths, as opposed to the worldly wisdom that the Corinthians were accustomed to. The "message of wisdom" is the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is considered foolishness to those who are perishing (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>) but is the power of God to those who are being saved. This wisdom is not based on human intellect or philosophy but is revealed through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>).<p><b>but not the wisdom of this age</b><br>The "wisdom of this age" refers to the prevailing philosophies and intellectual pursuits of the time, which were highly valued in Greek culture. Corinth, being a major city in ancient Greece, was a hub for such philosophical thought. The Greeks prized rhetoric and human wisdom, but Paul contrasts this with the divine wisdom found in the gospel. This distinction highlights the temporary and ultimately insufficient nature of human wisdom when compared to the eternal truth of God's wisdom.<p><b>or of the rulers of this age</b><br>The "rulers of this age" can be understood as both the political and religious leaders of the time, as well as spiritual forces opposed to God. Historically, this includes figures like the Roman authorities and Jewish leaders who rejected Christ. Spiritually, it can refer to demonic powers that influence worldly systems (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). These rulers are often seen as embodying the wisdom of the world, which stands in opposition to God's wisdom.<p><b>who are coming to nothing</b><br>This phrase underscores the transient nature of worldly power and wisdom. The rulers and their philosophies, which seem dominant and influential, are ultimately destined to fail and be rendered ineffective. This echoes the biblical theme that God's kingdom will prevail over all earthly powers (<a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>). The phrase also serves as a reminder of the ultimate victory of Christ, who will bring all things under His authority (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth, a city known for its diversity and philosophical thought.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A Christian community in a cosmopolitan city, struggling with issues of division and immorality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mature.htm">The Mature</a></b><br>Believers who are spiritually mature and able to understand deeper spiritual truths.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rulers_of_this_age.htm">Rulers of this Age</a></b><br>Refers to both spiritual and earthly leaders who rely on worldly wisdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_of_this_age.htm">Wisdom of this Age</a></b><br>The prevailing philosophical and cultural wisdom that is contrary to God's wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_maturity_and_wisdom.htm">Spiritual Maturity and Wisdom</a></b><br>Spiritual maturity is necessary to understand and appreciate God's wisdom.

In the original (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:">1Corinthians 2:4</a>) the word is "wisdom," and not "<span class= "ital">man's</span> wisdom," as in the English. Thus the statement here is a verbal contradiction of that in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:">1Corinthians 2:4</a>.

The "wisdom" of the gospel is that deep spiritual truth which only those whose spiritual natures have been trained and cultivated were capable of understanding. This "wisdom," however, the Apostle had not taught the Corinthians; he had only taught them the alphabet of Christianity, for they were still but "babes"--they were still only "fleshly" (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For you are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not carnal, and walk as men?">1Corinthians 3:3</a>). That the Apostle himself not only grasped the higher truths which he designates the "wisdom" of the gospel, but taught them gladly when there were hearers capable of appreciating them, is evident from many passages in the Epistles to the Romans, Colossians, and Ephesians, where he unfolds the "mysteries" of the gospel. (See <a href="/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-16.</span> - The <span class="accented">apparent foolishness is the only wisdom.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit.</span> In this passage he shows that in reality a crushing irony lay in his description of the gospel as being, in the world's judgment, "weak" and "foolish."
