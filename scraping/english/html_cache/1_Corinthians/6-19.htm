It suggests that the Corinthians should already be aware of the truth he is about to state, indicating that this teaching is foundational to Christian doctrine. The use of rhetorical questions is a common teaching method in Scripture, designed to provoke thought and self-examination.<p><b>that your body is a temple</b><br>In the context of the Corinthian church, which was situated in a city known for its immorality and pagan worship, the concept of the body as a temple would have been striking. Temples in the ancient world were sacred spaces dedicated to deities, and the idea that one's body could serve as such a space elevates the physical body to a place of spiritual significance. This aligns with the Old Testament understanding of the temple as the dwelling place of God (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27-30</a>).<p><b>of the Holy Spirit</b><br>The Holy Spirit's indwelling presence is a key aspect of New Testament theology, marking the believer as set apart for God. This indwelling is a fulfillment of the promise found in <a href="/ezekiel/36-27.htm">Ezekiel 36:27</a>, where God promises to put His Spirit within His people. The Holy Spirit empowers, guides, and sanctifies believers, making them holy and enabling them to live according to God's will.<p><b>who is in you</b><br>This phrase underscores the intimate and personal nature of the Holy Spirit's presence. Unlike the Old Testament, where God's presence was often external and associated with specific locations or objects, the New Testament reveals a more personal relationship where God dwells within the believer. This indwelling is a constant source of strength and guidance.<p><b>whom you have received from God?</b><br>The Holy Spirit is a gift from God, given to believers at the moment of salvation. This aligns with the promise of Jesus in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>, where He speaks of sending the Helper, the Spirit of truth. The reception of the Holy Spirit is not based on human merit but is a gracious act of God, emphasizing the believer's dependence on divine provision.<p><b>You are not your own;</b><br>This statement challenges the prevailing cultural norms of autonomy and self-ownership. In the Greco-Roman world, personal freedom and self-determination were highly valued. However, Paul reminds the Corinthians that, as believers, they belong to God. This concept is rooted in the idea of redemption, where believers are bought with a price, as further explained in the following verse (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>). This ownership by God calls for a life of obedience and submission to His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with guidance and correction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>A diverse and often troubled early Christian community in the city of Corinth, known for its moral and spiritual challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who indwells believers, empowering and sanctifying them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The giver of the Holy Spirit, emphasizing the divine origin and authority of the Spirit's presence in believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>A sacred place in Jewish tradition, representing God's dwelling place, now metaphorically applied to the believer's body.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_indwelling_presence.htm">The Indwelling Presence</a></b><br>Recognize the profound truth that the Holy Spirit resides within each believer, making our bodies sacred.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_of_the_body.htm">Stewardship of the Body</a></b><br>Understand that our bodies are not our own; they are entrusted to us by God, calling for responsible stewardship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>Embrace a lifestyle that reflects the holiness of the temple, avoiding actions and habits that defile the body.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Our identity is rooted in being God's temple, which should influence our self-perception and actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/empowerment_by_the_spirit.htm">Empowerment by the Spirit</a></b><br>Rely on the Holy Spirit's power to live a life that honors God, recognizing His role in our sanctification.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Corinthians_6_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 6:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Cor_6_19_Why_honor_our_bodies.htm">How does 1 Corinthians 6:19 emphasize the importance of honoring our bodies?

Which you have from God, and you are not your own. For you were bought with a price. Glorify God then in your body.</span><p>There are two reasons why we are not our own. (1) The Spirit which has possession of our bodies is not our own, but given us "of God." (2) We have been bought with a price, even the blood of Christ; it is a completed purchase (<a href="/context/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1Peter 1:18-19</a>). Our bodies not being our own to do as we like with, we have no right to give them over unto sin. The last words of the verse are not a cold logical deduction from the previous argument, but rather an earnest exhortation suggested by the solemn thought of our oneness with Christ, and the price paid by Him to make us His.<p>The words "and in your spirits," which are in the Authorised version, are not in the older Greek MSS. They were probably added to give a kind of verbal completeness to the exhortation. They only tend, however, to weaken the force of the passage as St. Paul wrote it. The dignity of the body is the subject of the previous passage, and the necessity for its purity the sole theme of the entire argument.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That your body is the temple</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">a sanctuary</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of the Holy Ghost.</span> He has already said that the Church is a shrine or sanctuary of the Holy Ghost (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>); but here for the first time expression is given to one of the deepest and newest truths of Christianity (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>). Three great epochs are marked by the use of the word temple.
