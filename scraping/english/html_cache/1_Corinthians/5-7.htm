The Apostle Paul uses this imagery to instruct the Corinthian church to remove sinful influences from their community. This echoes the Jewish practice during Passover, where all leaven is removed from homes, symbolizing a break from past sins and a fresh start. The "old leaven" refers to the sinful behaviors and attitudes that were prevalent in the Corinthian church, such as immorality and division. This call to purification is consistent with the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from sin, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a> and <a href="/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>.<p><b>that you may be a new unleavened batch</b><br>Paul encourages the Corinthians to become a "new unleavened batch," symbolizing purity and holiness. This transformation is not just a call to moral improvement but a reminder of their identity in Christ. The imagery of unleavened bread connects to the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which immediately follows Passover, where Israelites ate bread without yeast to commemorate their hasty departure from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-17.htm">Exodus 12:17-20</a>). This new identity is a call to live in accordance with the new life they have received through Christ, reflecting the transformative power of the Gospel.<p><b>as you really are</b><br>Paul emphasizes that the Corinthians are already positionally pure in Christ. This statement underscores the theological concept of justification, where believers are declared righteous through faith in Jesus. Despite their struggles with sin, Paul reminds them of their true identity as sanctified and set apart for God. This assurance is rooted in the finished work of Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, which affirm the believer's new creation status.<p><b>For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed</b><br>This phrase draws a direct parallel between Jesus and the Passover lamb, a central element of the Jewish Passover celebration. The Passover lamb was sacrificed to protect the Israelites from the final plague in Egypt, as described in <a href="/exodus/12-21.htm">Exodus 12:21-27</a>. By referring to Christ as the Passover lamb, Paul highlights the sacrificial nature of Jesus' death, which provides deliverance from sin and eternal death. This typology is further explored in <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, where John the Baptist calls Jesus "the Lamb of God," and in <a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>, which describes Christ as a lamb without blemish or defect.

The most essential requisite of the Jewish regulations, with which his whole training had made him so familiar, was the absolute putting away, and even destruction, of every trace of leaven, which was diligently sought for the day before the Passover began.

Ideally, Christians can only be addressed as "unleavened," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as "purged from their own old sins" (<a href="/2_peter/1-9.htm">2 Peter 1:9</a>); and it is the method of Scripture (indeed, it is the only possible method) to address Christians as being Christians <span class="accented">indeed</span>, and therefore in their <span class="accented">ideal</span> rather than their actual character. Some have taken these words to mean, "You are actually keeping the Passover, and therefore have no leaven among you;" but <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the words cannot bear this meaning; nor <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> was St. Paul likely to appeal so prominently to a Jewish ordinance; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> he is thinking of the Christian Easter, and only borrowing a casual illustration from the Jewish Passover. <span class="cmt_word">For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us;</span> rather, in the true reading, for our <span class="accented">passover also was sacrificed - even Christ.</span> As Christians, the Gentile Corinthians certainly did not keep the Jewish Passover; but St. Paul reminds them that they too had a Passover - that for them, too a Paschal Victim had been offered, whose sacrificial blood had been shed for their redemption (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; <a href="/john/19-36.htm">John 19:36</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).
