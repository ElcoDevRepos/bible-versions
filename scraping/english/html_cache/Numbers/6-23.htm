Aaron, the brother of Moses, was appointed as the first high priest, and his descendants were given the responsibility of performing sacred duties. This priestly role is significant in maintaining the spiritual well-being of the Israelites and mediating between God and His people. The priesthood is a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>.<p><b>This is how you are to bless the Israelites:</b><br>The blessing is a formal pronouncement of God's favor and protection over the people of Israel. It underscores the covenant relationship between God and the Israelites, where God promises to be their God and they are to be His people. The act of blessing is not just a wish for well-being but an invocation of divine favor, reflecting the deep connection between God and His chosen nation. This blessing is a precursor to the New Testament understanding of blessings in Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>.<p><b>Say to them:</b><br>The instruction to "say" indicates the importance of spoken words in conveying God's promises and blessings. In the ancient Near Eastern context, spoken words held power and authority, and this is reflected in the biblical narrative where God's word is creative and effective (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>). The spoken blessing is a means of imparting God's grace and peace to the people, and it foreshadows the power of the Word made flesh, Jesus Christ, who speaks life and truth into the world (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

The verse anchors the famous Aaronic Benediction in divine authority, assuring us that when God&#8217;s word is obeyed, His blessing surely follows.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel.</span>--The occasions on which this blessing was used are not recorded. The blessing itself, which marks in a special manner the spiritual character of the chosen people, consists of three double clauses. In each of these three clauses the sacred name Jehovah is repeated, and there is a rising gradation in the blessing invoked, until it culminates in that peace which is the highest of those gifts that God can bestow and that man can possess. There has been commonly recognised in this blessing an allusion to the doctrine of the Trinity. Mention is made in <a href="/leviticus/9-22.htm" title="And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.">Leviticus 9:22</a> of a blessing pronounced by Aaron upon the people, but no form of words is found there.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On this wise ye shall bless.</span> In <a href="/leviticus/9-22.htm">Leviticus 9:22</a> it is recorded that Aaron blessed the people, first by himself from the brazen altar of sacrifice, and afterwards in conjunction with Moses, when they came out of the tabernacle; and that he might so bless the people is mentioned as one object of his consecration (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; and cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/23-13.htm">1 Chronicles 23:13</a>). Blessing in or with the name of the Supreme Being was an important part of all primitive religion, as appears from the case of Melchizedec and Abraham, of Isaac and his sons, of Jacob and Pharaoh. And this act of blessing was far from being a mere expression of good will, or from being a simple prayer; for" without all contradiction the less is blessed of the greater" (<a href="/hebrews/7-7.htm">Hebrews 7:7</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the blessing must be given by one who stands nearer to God to one who stands less near. The name of God could not be used in blessing save by one who had some right to such use of it, whether as prophet, as priest, or as patriarch. For that name in which the blessing was given <span class="accented">was</span> not inoperative, but was mighty with untold spiritual efficacy where rightly used as the name of blessing. To Aaron and to his sons was now confided this use of the Divine name, that all Israel might know and might hear in their appointed words the voice of God himself. <span class="cmt_word">Saying</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto them.</span> The benediction here appointed consists of three clauses, each complete in itself, and each consisting of two members, the second of which seems to present the application and result in experience of the grace besought in the first. Both, therefore, in its form and its contents this benediction is one of the most profound and most fruitful of the Divine oracles; and this indeed we might have expected, because (if we may venture to say so) God is never so entirely and absolutely himself as in blessing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/6-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(dab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Aaron</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_175.htm">Strong's 175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aaron -- an elder brother of Moses</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his sons:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">This is how you are to bless</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1458;&#1499;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;ra&#774;&#183;&#7733;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1288.htm">Strong's 1288: </a> </span><span class="str2">To kneel, to bless God, man, to curse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Israelites.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Say to them:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1502;&#1465;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#183;m&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/6-23.htm">OT Law: Numbers 6:23 Speak to Aaron and to his sons (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/6-22.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 6:22"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 6:22" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/6-24.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 6:24"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 6:24" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
