In the biblical narrative, God often communicates through dreams or visions at night, as seen with figures like Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>) and Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5</a>). Balaam, though a non-Israelite prophet, receives a direct message from God, highlighting God's sovereignty over all nations and peoples. This encounter underscores the theme of God's control over events and His ability to use even those outside the covenant community for His purposes.<p><b>Since these men have come to summon you,</b><br>The men referred to are the emissaries of Balak, king of Moab, who sought Balaam's services to curse the Israelites. This reflects the historical context of the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land and the fear they instilled in surrounding nations. The Moabites, descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>), were historically related to Israel but often in conflict with them. The summoning of Balaam, a renowned seer, indicates the seriousness of Balak's intent and the perceived threat of Israel.<p><b>get up and go with them,</b><br>God permits Balaam to accompany the Moabite officials, which may seem contradictory to His earlier command not to go (<a href="/numbers/22-12.htm">Numbers 22:12</a>). This reflects a biblical theme where God allows human free will to operate within His sovereign plan. It also sets the stage for the unfolding narrative where Balaam's intentions and God's ultimate purpose will be revealed. The command to "get up" signifies readiness and obedience, a common biblical motif when God calls individuals to action.<p><b>but you must only do what I tell you.</b><br>This condition emphasizes God's control over the situation and Balaam's role as a mouthpiece for divine will. It foreshadows the events where Balaam, despite his own inclinations, can only pronounce blessings over Israel (Numbers 23-24). This directive highlights the biblical principle that true prophecy is not subject to human manipulation but is a revelation of God's will. It also prefigures the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the ultimate prophet who speaks only what the Father commands (<a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49-50</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner known for his ability to bless or curse.
