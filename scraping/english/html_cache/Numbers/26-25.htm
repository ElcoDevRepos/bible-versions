The name Issachar means "reward" or "recompense," reflecting Leah's hope for her son. The tribe was known for its wisdom and understanding of the times, as noted in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>. Issachar's territory was located in the fertile Jezreel Valley, which was significant for agriculture and trade routes. This strategic location contributed to the tribe's prosperity and influence.<p><b>and their registration numbered 64,300</b><br>This census was conducted in the plains of Moab by the Jordan River, near Jericho, as the Israelites prepared to enter the Promised Land. The number 64,300 represents the men of fighting age, indicating the tribe's military strength. This census was part of a broader effort to organize the Israelites for the conquest of Canaan. The increase in numbers from the previous census in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a> reflects God's blessing and faithfulness in fulfilling His promise to Abraham to multiply his descendants. The census also served to allocate land inheritance among the tribes, as seen in <a href="/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19</a>. The growth of Issachar's numbers can be seen as a testament to God's provision and the tribe's role in the unfolding narrative of Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/issachar.htm">Issachar</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Issachar, the fifth son of Jacob and Leah.
