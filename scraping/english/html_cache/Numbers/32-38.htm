Nebo is associated with Mount Nebo, where Moses viewed the Promised Land before his death. Baal-meon, also known as Beth-baal-meon, was a city dedicated to the Canaanite god Baal, indicating the prevalent pagan worship in the area. The changing of names signifies a rejection of the pagan past and an assertion of Israelite identity and sovereignty. This act of renaming is reminiscent of other biblical instances where names are changed to reflect a new purpose or divine intervention, such as Abram to Abraham or Jacob to Israel.<p><b>and Sibmah.</b><br>Sibmah was another city in the region of Moab, known for its vineyards, as mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8-9</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/48-32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32</a>. The mention of Sibmah highlights the agricultural richness of the area, which was attractive to the tribes of Reuben and Gad. The vineyards of Sibmah were renowned, and the city&#8217;s inclusion in this list underscores the economic potential that the Israelites sought to harness. The control of such fertile land would have been crucial for sustaining the tribes' livestock and agricultural activities.<p><b>And they renamed the cities they rebuilt.</b><br>Renaming and rebuilding the cities symbolize the transformation and establishment of a new order under Israelite control. This act of rebuilding is not just physical but also spiritual, as it involves purging the land of its former idolatrous associations. The renaming signifies a new beginning and dedication to the God of Israel, aligning with the broader biblical theme of renewal and redemption. This transformation can be seen as a type of Christ, who brings new life and identity to believers, as stated in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, where those in Christ are described as a new creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebo.htm">Nebo</a></b><br>A city located in the territory east of the Jordan River, associated with the tribe of Reuben.
