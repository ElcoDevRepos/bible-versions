In the context of ancient Israel, being "cut off" often meant being excommunicated from the community or even facing death. This reflects the seriousness with which the covenant community was to regard the holiness of God and the purity of His people. The concept of being cut off is seen elsewhere in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>, where it refers to those who break the covenant of circumcision. It underscores the importance of obedience and the dire consequences of rebellion against God's commands.<p><b>because he has despised the word of the LORD</b><br>Despising the word of the LORD implies a willful and deliberate rejection of God's authority and instructions. This is not a sin of ignorance but one of defiance. In biblical terms, to despise God's word is to treat it with contempt, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a>, which warns of the destruction that comes to those who scorn divine instruction. This attitude reflects a hardened heart, similar to Pharaoh's in Exodus, and is contrasted with the reverence and obedience expected of God's people.<p><b>and broken His commandment</b><br>Breaking God's commandment signifies a direct violation of His law. The commandments were given to Israel as a covenantal guide for living in relationship with God and each other. This phrase highlights the seriousness of sin as a breach of the divine covenant, akin to the breaking of a legal contract. The historical context of the Mosaic Law, as seen in Exodus and Deuteronomy, emphasizes the importance of adherence to God's statutes as a reflection of faithfulness and love for Him.<p><b>his guilt remains on him.</b><br>The phrase indicates that the individual's sin is not atoned for and that they remain in a state of guilt before God. In the sacrificial system of ancient Israel, atonement was necessary to remove guilt and restore the sinner to a right relationship with God. <a href="/leviticus/4.htm">Leviticus 4</a> outlines the process of atonement through sacrifice, which foreshadows the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ. The enduring guilt of the unrepentant sinner serves as a warning of the eternal consequences of sin without repentance and faith in Christ, as seen in the New Testament teachings on judgment and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who gave the law to His people through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites and the mediator of God's law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are receiving the laws and commandments as they journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites are traveling after their exodus from Egypt, a place of testing and revelation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>The commandments given by God to guide the moral, ceremonial, and civil life of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not merely a mistake but a willful act of rebellion against God's holy word.

The guilt of such rebellion remains until atonement is sought on God&#8217;s terms. For Israel that meant sacrificial blood; for us, it is the finished work of Christ.
