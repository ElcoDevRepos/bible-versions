This requirement underscores the importance of maintaining ritual purity in the Israelite community, as outlined in Levitical law. The role of the clean person in the purification process highlights the communal responsibility for maintaining holiness, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11-15</a>.<p><b>is to sprinkle the unclean person</b><br>The act of sprinkling involves the use of water mixed with the ashes of a red heifer, as described earlier in <a href="/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>. This ritual signifies the removal of impurity and is a physical representation of spiritual cleansing. The use of water in purification rites is a recurring theme in the Bible, symbolizing cleansing and renewal, as seen in <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>.<p><b>on the third day and on the seventh day</b><br>The specific timing of the sprinkling on the third and seventh days emphasizes the completeness and thoroughness of the purification process. The number seven often represents completeness or perfection in the Bible, as seen in the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. The third day is also significant in biblical typology, often associated with resurrection and new beginnings, as seen in <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a> and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.<p><b>After he purifies the unclean person on the seventh day</b><br>The completion of the purification process on the seventh day signifies a return to a state of ritual purity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of restoration and reconciliation with God, as seen in the Day of Atonement rituals in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>. The purification process foreshadows the ultimate cleansing from sin through Jesus Christ, as described in <a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>.<p><b>the one being cleansed must wash his clothes and bathe in water</b><br>Washing clothes and bathing in water are tangible actions that symbolize the removal of impurity and the renewal of the individual. This practice is consistent with other purification rituals in the Old Testament, such as those in <a href="/leviticus/14.htm">Leviticus 14</a> for cleansing from leprosy. The emphasis on external washing points to the need for internal spiritual cleansing, as later emphasized by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>.<p><b>and that evening he will be clean</b><br>The declaration of cleanliness by evening marks the end of the purification process and the restoration of the individual to the community. This timing aligns with the Jewish understanding of a day beginning at sunset, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-5.htm">Genesis 1:5</a>. The transition from impurity to purity by evening reflects the hope of transformation and renewal, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the promise of new life in Christ, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_clean_man.htm">The Clean Man</a></b><br>This individual is ceremonially clean and responsible for performing the purification ritual.
