Judah's large number of men, 186,400, indicates its strength and leadership role among the tribes. This number includes men aged 20 and older who are able to go to war, highlighting the military readiness of the tribe. Judah's prominence is further emphasized by its association with kingship, as King David and ultimately Jesus Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, come from this lineage. The large number also signifies God's blessing and favor upon Judah, as it is the largest of the tribes, fulfilling Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-10</a>, where Judah is prophesied to be a leader among his brothers.<p><b>they shall set out first.</b><br>Judah's position as the first to set out underscores its leadership and preeminence among the tribes. This order of march is significant, as it sets the tone for the journey and the battles ahead. Being first implies a role of guidance and protection for the other tribes, as they follow Judah's lead. This precedence is a foreshadowing of Judah's future role in leading the nation, as seen in the monarchy established under David. The leadership of Judah in the wilderness journey can be seen as a type of Christ, who leads His people as the firstborn from the dead (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>) and the head of the Church.
