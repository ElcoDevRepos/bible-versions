Despite being the firstborn, Reuben lost his birthright due to an indiscretion with his father's concubine (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22, 49</a>:3-4). This tribe settled on the east side of the Jordan River, in a region known for its pasturelands (<a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32:1-5</a>). The tribe of Reuben often struggled with maintaining its prominence and influence among the tribes of Israel.<p><b>the firstborn of Israel</b><br>Reuben's status as the firstborn is significant in biblical tradition, as the firstborn typically held a place of honor and received a double portion of the inheritance. However, Reuben's actions led to a loss of this privilege, which was later transferred to Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh (<a href="/1_chronicles/5.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1-2</a>). This shift in birthright reflects the theme of God's sovereignty in choosing leaders and blessing those who are faithful.<p><b>according to the records of their clans and families</b><br>The organization of the tribes into clans and families highlights the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite society. These records were crucial for maintaining tribal identity and inheritance rights. The detailed genealogies found throughout the Old Testament underscore the Israelites' emphasis on ancestry and God's covenant promises to Abraham's descendants.<p><b>counting one by one the names of every male</b><br>The census was a methodical process, emphasizing the importance of each individual within the community. This careful enumeration reflects the value placed on each member's contribution to the collective identity and mission of Israel. It also underscores the need for order and structure within the camp, as they prepared for their journey and eventual conquest of the Promised Land.<p><b>twenty years of age or older</b><br>The age of twenty was considered the age of maturity and responsibility in ancient Israel. It was the age at which males were eligible for military service and participation in communal decision-making. This age requirement ensured that those counted were capable of bearing arms and contributing to the defense and expansion of the nation.<p><b>who could serve in the army</b><br>Military service was a critical aspect of Israelite life, especially as they prepared to enter and conquer the land of Canaan. The ability to serve in the army was not only a matter of physical capability but also a demonstration of commitment to the community and faith in God's promises. This phrase also foreshadows the numerous battles Israel would face and the need for a strong, unified force to fulfill God's plan for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben.htm">Reuben</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Jacob (Israel) and Leah.
