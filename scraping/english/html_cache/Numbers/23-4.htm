In the broader biblical narrative, God often meets with His chosen servants, such as Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a>). This meeting underscores God's control over the situation, despite Balaam's pagan background. It also highlights the theme of God's omnipresence and His ability to use anyone to fulfill His purposes, as seen in other instances like Cyrus in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>.<p><b>&#8220;I have set up seven altars,&#8221;</b><br>The number seven in the Bible often symbolizes completeness or perfection, as seen in the creation week (Genesis 1-2). Balaam's use of seven altars may reflect an attempt to fully appease or impress God, aligning with ancient Near Eastern practices where specific numbers held ritual significance. This act of setting up altars is reminiscent of patriarchal practices, such as Abraham building altars to the Lord (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). However, Balaam's altars are not for Yahweh alone, indicating a syncretistic approach to worship.<p><b>Balaam said,</b><br>Balaam, a non-Israelite prophet, is a complex figure who acknowledges the true God yet is entangled in pagan practices. His story is a reminder of the tension between true prophecy and divination, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>, where divination is condemned. Balaam's role in the narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of compromising with pagan practices while acknowledging the true God.<p><b>&#8220;and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.&#8221;</b><br>The offering of a bull and a ram on each altar reflects common sacrificial practices in the ancient Near East, where such offerings were made to seek favor or guidance from deities. In the Israelite context, bulls and rams were significant in sacrificial rituals, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>. These offerings symbolize atonement and dedication, yet Balaam's sacrifices are not made in the context of the covenant relationship with Yahweh. This highlights the contrast between true worship and ritualistic attempts to manipulate divine favor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign deity of Israel, who communicates with Balaam in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner hired by Balak to curse Israel, yet God uses him to bless Israel instead.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who fears the Israelites and seeks Balaam's help to curse them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_altars.htm">Seven Altars</a></b><br>The altars prepared by Balaam as part of a ritualistic attempt to gain favor with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bulls_and_rams.htm">Bulls and Rams</a></b><br>Sacrificial animals offered by Balaam on the altars, symbolizing an attempt to appease or communicate with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite human intentions, God's will prevails.

Balaam does not conjure or manipulate; the Almighty graciously comes to him, underscoring divine sovereignty (cf. <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene reminds us that whenever God engages a person&#8212;even a flawed prophet&#8212;His word stands supreme (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s willingness to meet Balaam also highlights His overarching plan for Israel&#8217;s blessing in the face of Moabite opposition (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/22-12.htm">Numbers 22:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have set up seven altars</b><p>&#8226; Balaam&#8217;s report, &#8220;I have set up seven altars,&#8221; reflects careful preparation (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>; <a href="/job/42-8.htm">Job 42:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The number seven often signals completeness (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>), implying Balaam believes he has offered a full, impressive worship package.<p>&#8226; Yet the emphasis is not on Balaam&#8217;s effort but on God&#8217;s response; human ritual never obligates the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and on each altar</b><p>&#8226; The phrase underscores thoroughness&#8212;sacrifice replicated seven times.

While Balaam&#8217;s actions seem impressive, the account stresses that divine initiative, not human ceremony, determines the outcome. God listens, but He remains unbribable and steadfast to His promise of blessing Israel. The verse reminds us that meeting with God is always on His terms, and true worship rests in obedience and faith rather than in multiplied offerings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I</span> <span class="cmt_word">have prepared seven altars.</span> Balaam, acting for the king of Moab, his heathen patron, in this difficult business, points out to God that he had given him the full quota of sacrifices to begin with.
