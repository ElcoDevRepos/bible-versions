The context is the Israelites' refusal to enter the Promised Land due to fear, as recounted in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13-14</a>. God's anger is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often resulting from Israel's rebellion or idolatry. This anger is not capricious but a righteous response to sin. The phrase "kindled" suggests a fire, symbolizing the intensity of God's displeasure. This reflects God's holiness and justice, as seen in other instances like the golden calf incident (Exodus 32).<p><b>and He swore an oath, saying,</b><br>God's oath underscores the seriousness of the situation. In biblical times, an oath was a solemn promise, often invoking divine witness. God's oaths are irrevocable, highlighting His unchanging nature and the certainty of His words. This particular oath relates to the consequences for the Israelites' lack of faith, as God decrees that the current generation would not enter the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/14-28.htm">Numbers 14:28-30</a>). This connects to the broader biblical theme of faith and obedience, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-19</a>, which warns believers against hardening their hearts as the Israelites did.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whose anger is kindled due to the disobedience and lack of faith of the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are on the brink of entering the Promised Land but have shown reluctance and disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land (Canaan)</a></b><br>The land promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which the Israelites are preparing to enter.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who communicates God's commands and judgments to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_transjordan_tribes.htm">The Transjordan Tribes (Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh)</a></b><br>These tribes requested to settle on the east side of the Jordan River, which led to the events surrounding God's anger.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_disobedience.htm">The Seriousness of Disobedience</a></b><br>God's anger is a response to the Israelites' disobedience, reminding us that our actions have consequences and that God takes sin seriously.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_faith.htm">The Importance of Faith</a></b><br>The Israelites' lack of faith in God's promises led to His anger.

Israel&#8217;s refusal to trust God&#8217;s promise provoked His righteous anger, paralleling <a href="/deuteronomy/1-34.htm">Deuteronomy 1:34</a> and <a href="/psalms/95-10.htm">Psalm 95:10</a>.<p>&#8226; This is not a passing irritation; &#8220;kindled&#8221; pictures a fire that has caught and burns hot (compare <a href="/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1</a>; <a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s anger always arises from holiness offended, never caprice. In <a href="/hebrews/3-8.htm">Hebrews 3:8&#8211;11</a> the same event is cited to warn believers against hardening their hearts.<p>&#8226; The immediate audience&#8212;Reuben, Gad, and half-Manasseh&#8212;needed the reminder. Their request for land east of the Jordan (<a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1&#8211;5</a>) risked repeating their fathers&#8217; reluctance to enter Canaan. By rehearsing God&#8217;s anger, Moses urges them to act in faith, not fear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He swore an oath</b><p>&#8226; Divine anger issues in a solemn oath: God binds His own word with an unchangeable declaration (<a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; The oath barred the unbelieving generation from the promised land (<a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22-23</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-35.htm">Deuteronomy 1:35</a>), underscoring that unbelief forfeits blessing.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s oaths reveal both justice and mercy. Justice: the sentence stands firm (<a href="/psalms/95-11.htm">Psalm 95:11</a>). Mercy: the next generation will inherit (<a href="/numbers/14-31.htm">Numbers 14:31</a>), showing that judgment never nullifies the covenant.<p>&#8226; For the two and a half tribes, this oath is a historical anchor. If they neglect to follow their brothers into conquest, they align with those who fell under that very oath (<a href="/numbers/32-15.htm">Numbers 32:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>&#8226; The word prepares the listener for the content that follows in verses 11-13. Scripture&#8217;s narrative slows here to make us feel the weight of God&#8217;s spoken judgment.<p>&#8226; Every &#8220;saying&#8221; of the LORD is effectual: &#8220;My word&#8230; will not return to Me empty&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). Once the oath is voiced, forty years in the wilderness become an unalterable reality.<p>&#8226; The pattern&#8212;anger, oath, spoken judgment&#8212;reminds believers that God means what He says. When He promises blessing, it is equally certain (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>).<p>&#8226; The tribes at Moses&#8217; feet are called to listen carefully so they do not find themselves on the wrong side of His next &#8220;saying.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/32-10.htm">Numbers 32:10</a> revisits the moment when unbelief ignited God&#8217;s holy anger, leading Him to seal judgment with an irrevocable oath. Moses recounts it to warn the eastern tribes&#8212;and us&#8212;that God&#8217;s words are sure, His justice uncompromising, and His promises, whether of discipline or blessing, absolutely dependable. Trusting Him and obeying promptly guard us from kindling that same anger and position us to inherit the fullness of what He has sworn for our good.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/32-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the LORD&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">anger</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1445;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_639.htm">Strong's 639: </a> </span><span class="str2">The nose, nostril, the face, a person, ire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was kindled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;&#7717;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
