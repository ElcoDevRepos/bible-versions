Miriam was a prophetess (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>), and Aaron was the high priest (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). Their criticism of Moses highlights a moment of familial and leadership tension. This incident reflects the human tendency towards jealousy and rivalry, even among those chosen by God for leadership. It also underscores the challenges Moses faced, not only from the people but from his own family. This criticism can be seen as a challenge to Moses' unique relationship with God, which is later addressed by God Himself (<a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>).<p><b>because of the Cushite woman he had married</b><br>The identity of the Cushite woman is debated. Cush typically refers to a region south of Egypt, often associated with modern-day Sudan or Ethiopia. This suggests that Moses' wife was of African descent, which may have been a point of contention due to ethnic and cultural differences. Some scholars propose that this woman could be Zipporah, Moses' Midianite wife (<a href="/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>), suggesting that "Cushite" might refer to her appearance or a different aspect of her identity. The mention of her ethnicity highlights issues of racial and cultural acceptance, which are still relevant today.<p><b>for he had taken a Cushite wife</b><br>The repetition emphasizes the reason for Miriam and Aaron's criticism. It suggests that their issue was not just with Moses' leadership but specifically with his marriage to a foreign woman. This reflects broader themes in the Old Testament regarding intermarriage with non-Israelites, which was often discouraged to prevent idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). However, Moses' marriage to a Cushite woman also prefigures the inclusive nature of God's covenant, which ultimately extends to all nations through Jesus Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).

Immediately afterward, another complaint surfaces&#8212;this time from Moses&#8217; own siblings.<p>&#8226; This progression shows how quickly discontent can resurface even after divine discipline, echoing the cycle in <a href="/bsb/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15-17</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Miriam and Aaron</b><p>&#8226; Both are named, but Miriam is listed first.

Sibling unity is meant for mutual support (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>), yet here it becomes a platform for criticism.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly warns that spiritual leadership does not exempt one from falling into sin (<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>criticized Moses</b><p>&#8226; The verb indicates open verbal opposition.

Opposition to God-ordained leadership ultimately challenges God Himself (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Moses is later called &#8220;very humble, more than any man on the face of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/12-3.htm">Numbers 12:3</a>), contrasting their pride with his humility (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because of the Cushite woman</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Cushite&#8221; points to someone from Cush (modern Sudan/Ethiopia), a region south of Egypt (<a href="/isaiah/18-1.htm">Isaiah 18:1-2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/13-23.htm">Jeremiah 13:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Their complaint centers on ethnicity, revealing prejudice.

The text offers no hint of wrongdoing in the union itself. The absence of divine rebuke toward Moses implies divine approval.<p>&#8226; Earlier, Moses married Zipporah of Midian (<a href="/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>). Whether the Cushite woman is Zipporah or a second wife, the focus is not on polygamy or chronology but on Miriam and Aaron&#8217;s heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Their fixation on a personal detail masks a deeper power struggle revealed in verse 2: &#8220;Has the LORD spoken only through Moses?&#8221;&#8212;a classic tactic of envy (<a href="/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for he had taken a Cushite wife</b><p>&#8226; Scripture repeats the reason, emphasizing the real issue: their complaint rests on a surface rationale, but God exposes the underlying rebellion.<p>&#8226; Repetition in Hebrew narrative spotlights what readers must not miss (<a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>). Here, it underlines that ethnic bias was merely the pretext for challenging Moses&#8217; authority.<p>&#8226; The LORD&#8217;s response&#8212;striking Miriam with leprosy (<a href="/numbers/12-10.htm">Numbers 12:10</a>)&#8212;targets the very area of complaint: skin. The punishment matches the sin, vividly reinforcing God&#8217;s stance against prejudice (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/12-1.htm">Numbers 12:1</a> records a historical moment when Miriam and Aaron, spiritual leaders and siblings of Moses, allow envy and ethnic bias to erupt into open criticism. Their focus on Moses&#8217; Cushite wife serves as a veneer for a deeper rebellion against God-appointed authority. The passage warns believers against cloaking pride in pious-sounding objections, reminds us that God values every ethnicity equally, and calls us to humble submission to His chosen leadership&#8212;echoing timeless truths affirmed throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XII.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses.--</span>Miriam appears to have been the leader in this insurrection against the authority of Moses. Her name occurs before that of Aaron, either as the nearer or as the more prominent subject; and the verb which is rendered "spake" is in the feminine gender. Moreover, the judgment which was inflicted (<a href="/numbers/12-10.htm" title="And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked on Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.">Numbers 12:10</a>) fell upon Miriam, not upon Aaron. who seems to have yielded to the suggestions of Miriam, as he had previously done to the request of the Israelites in regard to the golden calf.<p><span class= "bld">Because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married.</span>--Some suppose that the reference is to Zipporah, who may have been included amongst the Asiatic division of the Ethiopians, or Cushites (comp. <a href="/habakkuk/3-7.htm" title="I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.">Habakkuk 3:7</a>, where the tents of Cushan, or Cush, are coupled with the curtains of Midian), and that the occasion of the opposition to Moses was the undue influence which he is supposed to have allowed Hobab and other members of Zipporah's family to exercise over him. This supposition, however, seems improbable on many accounts. The words, "for he had married an Ethiopian (or Cushite) woman," naturally point to some recent occurrence, not to one which had taken place more than forty years previously, and which is, therefore, very unlikely to have given occasion to the murmuring of Miriam and Aaron at this time. Moreover, the murmuring is expressly connected with the Cushite herself, not with any of the subsequent or incidental results of the marriage. It seems, therefore, much more probable that Zipporah was dead, and that Moses had married one of the African Cushites who had accompanied the Israelites in their march out of Egypt, or one of the Cushites who dwelt in Arabia, and who were found at this time in the neighbourhood of Sinai. A similar marriage had been contracted by Joseph, and such marriages were not forbidden by the Law, which prohibited marriage with the Canaanites (<a href="/exodus/34-16.htm" title="And you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make your sons go a whoring after their gods.">Exodus 34:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Miriam</span> <span class="cmt_word">and Aaron spake against Moses.</span> While the people were encamped at Hazeroth (see verse 16), and therefore probably very soon after the events of the last chapter.
