Og was one of the last of the Rephaim, a group of giants mentioned in the Old Testament. His defeat is significant as it demonstrates God's power and faithfulness in delivering His people. The victory over Og is a continuation of the conquest narrative, where God leads Israel to claim the land promised to their ancestors.<p><b>along with his sons and his whole army,</b><br>The complete destruction of Og's forces, including his sons, signifies the totality of the victory. In ancient Near Eastern warfare, the defeat of a king and his heirs was crucial to prevent any future claims to the throne or attempts to reclaim lost territory. This action ensured the security of the Israelites and the fulfillment of God's promise to give them the land.<p><b>until no remnant was left.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the thoroughness of the victory. In biblical terms, leaving no remnant often symbolizes divine judgment and the complete eradication of evil influences. It reflects the idea that God's people must fully remove sin and opposition to His will from their midst, a theme echoed throughout Scripture.<p><b>And they took possession of his land.</b><br>The taking of Og's land marks a significant step in the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land. Bashan, known for its fertile land and strong cities, became part of the inheritance for the tribes of Israel. This act of taking possession is a fulfillment of God's covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it prefigures the ultimate inheritance believers receive through Christ. The land serves as a type of the eternal rest and kingdom that God promises to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/og.htm">Og</a></b><br>The king of Bashan, a region east of the Jordan River.
