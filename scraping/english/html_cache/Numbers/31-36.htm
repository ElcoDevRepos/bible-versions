This phrase refers to the division of the spoils of war. The warriors who participated in the battle received half of the plunder. This division underscores the principle of rewarding those who actively engage in the Lord's battles, a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>, where David establishes a statute that those who stay with the supplies share equally with those who fight.<p><b>337,500 sheep,</b><br>The specific number of sheep indicates the vastness of the plunder taken from the Midianites. Sheep were a significant measure of wealth in ancient times, providing not only food but also wool for clothing. This large number reflects the prosperity of the Midianites and the extent of the victory God granted to Israel. The division of livestock as part of the spoils is consistent with other biblical accounts of war, such as in <a href="/2_chronicles/14-13.htm">2 Chronicles 14:13-15</a>, where livestock is also taken as plunder.
