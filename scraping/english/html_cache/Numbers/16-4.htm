In this context, "this" refers to the rebellion led by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram against Moses' leadership and Aaron's priesthood. This rebellion is significant as it represents a direct challenge to God's appointed leaders. The Israelites were in the wilderness, a time of testing and reliance on God's guidance. Moses' role as a mediator between God and the people is crucial, and this rebellion threatens the order established by God.<p><b>he fell facedown</b><br>Falling facedown is a posture of humility, submission, and prayer. It indicates Moses' immediate response to seek God's guidance and intervention. This act is consistent with Moses' character as a humble leader who often intercedes for the people (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>, <a href="/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13-19</a>). In the ancient Near Eastern culture, prostration was a common expression of reverence and supplication, especially in the presence of a deity or a king. Moses' action here can be seen as an appeal to God for wisdom and judgment in dealing with the rebellion. This posture also prefigures Christ's humility and submission to the Father's will, as seen in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
