Her name means "Yahweh is glory," reflecting the faith and reverence she held for God. Jochebed's role as a mother is crucial in the history of Israel, as her children played pivotal roles in the Exodus and the establishment of the priesthood. Her marriage to Amram, a member of the tribe of Levi, aligns with the Levitical lineage that is central to the priestly functions in Israel.<p><b>She was also a daughter of Levi,</b><br>Jochebed's lineage as a daughter of Levi places her within the tribe set apart for religious duties. The Levites were chosen by God to serve in the tabernacle and later the temple, emphasizing the spiritual heritage passed down to her children. This connection underscores the importance of the Levitical line in maintaining the worship and laws of Israel.<p><b>born to Levi in Egypt.</b><br>Jochebed's birth in Egypt highlights the Israelites' long sojourn in a foreign land, which began with Joseph and his brothers. This period in Egypt was marked by both prosperity and eventual oppression, setting the stage for the Exodus. Her birth in Egypt signifies the continuity of the Israelite identity and faith despite living in a land of idolatry and enslavement.<p><b>To Amram she bore Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam.</b><br>The children of Jochebed and Amram are central figures in the biblical narrative. Aaron became the first high priest, establishing the Aaronic priesthood. Moses is the great prophet and leader who delivered Israel from Egyptian bondage, receiving the Law at Sinai. Miriam, a prophetess, played a key role in the Exodus narrative, particularly in leading the women in worship after crossing the Red Sea. Together, these siblings represent leadership, prophecy, and priesthood, foreshadowing the roles fulfilled by Jesus Christ as prophet, priest, and king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amram.htm">Amram</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Levi, Amram is the father of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

Naming her affirms God&#8217;s regard for individual faithfulness; though centuries have passed since Levi&#8217;s arrival in Egypt, the family line is traced with precision (<a href="/genesis/46-11.htm">Genesis 46:11</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/11-23.htm">Hebrews 11:23</a> highlights the courageous faith shared by both parents when they hid infant Moses, showing that Jochebed was far more than a background figure&#8212;she trusted God under dangerous circumstances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She was also a daughter of Levi</b><p>Emphasizing that Jochebed herself descended from Levi shows the purity and continuity of the priestly tribe (<a href="/numbers/26-58.htm">Numbers 26:58</a>).<p>&#8226; Both father (Amram) and mother (Jochebed) come from Levi, underlining that the priesthood later entrusted to Aaron originated from two fully Levitical parents (<a href="/exodus/2-1.htm">Exodus 2:1</a>).<p>&#8226; This detail fulfills earlier covenant promises that a distinct tribe would serve the sanctuary (<a href="/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Born to Levi in Egypt</b><p>Jochebed was born after the family relocated to Egypt, making her part of the first generation born outside Canaan.<p>&#8226; Her birth &#8220;in Egypt&#8221; reminds us that God preserved His people even under foreign rule (<a href="/genesis/50-24.htm">Genesis 50:24-25</a>; <a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse assures the reader that the Levites remained identifiable and faithful despite assimilation pressures, proving the historical reliability of Moses&#8217; genealogical notes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To Amram she bore Aaron</b><p>Aaron, Jochebed&#8217;s first-named son, became &#8220;the priest&#8221;

Some writers have supposed that Jochebed was the granddaughter, or possibly even some more remote descendant of Levi, and that Amram, the father of Moses, was not the same as Amram, the son of Kohath. (See Keil, "On the Pentateuch," i. 469-471; but for a defence of the view which has been more commonly adopted, see Birks' "Exodus of Israel," pp. 153-199.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 59.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt.</span> Rather, "whom she (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span>) bare." The missing subject is usually supplied, as in the A.V., and there certainly seems no more difficulty in doing so here than in <a href="/1_kings/1-6.htm">1 Kings 1:6</a>.
