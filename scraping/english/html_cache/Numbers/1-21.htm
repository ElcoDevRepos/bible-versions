This census was for military purposes, counting men aged 20 and older who were able to go to war. It reflects the organization and preparation of the Israelites as they prepared to enter the Promised Land. The act of registration signifies the importance of order and accountability within the community of God's people.<p><b>to the tribe of Reuben</b><br>Reuben was the firstborn son of Jacob and Leah. Despite his status as the firstborn, Reuben lost his birthright due to his sin with Bilhah, his father's concubine (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/5.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>). The tribe of Reuben settled on the east side of the Jordan River, in the region of Gilead. This location was significant for its fertile land, suitable for their large flocks and herds. The tribe's history is marked by a lack of prominence compared to other tribes, possibly reflecting Reuben's loss of the birthright.<p><b>numbered 46,500</b><br>The specific number of 46,500 men indicates the size and strength of the tribe of Reuben at the time of the census. This number is significant as it reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham to make his descendants numerous (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). The census also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness in preserving and multiplying His people despite their previous disobedience and wanderings in the wilderness. The precise counting underscores the importance of each individual within the community and God's intimate knowledge of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben.htm">Reuben</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Jacob and Leah, Reuben is the patriarch of the tribe mentioned in this verse.
