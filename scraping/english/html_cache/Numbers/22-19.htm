The request to "stay here overnight" suggests a customary practice of seeking divine guidance through dreams or night-time revelations, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures. The mention of "as the others did" refers to the previous group of messengers sent by Balak, highlighting the persistence of Balak's request and the importance of the matter at hand.<p><b>that I may find out what else the LORD has to tell me.</b><br>Balaam's desire to "find out what else the LORD has to tell me" underscores his recognition of the authority of the LORD, the God of Israel, despite his own pagan background. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all nations and peoples. The phrase suggests that Balaam is aware of the need for further divine instruction, indicating a process of revelation that is not yet complete. This moment foreshadows the unfolding of God's will, which ultimately leads to Balaam's blessing of Israel instead of cursing them, as Balak desired. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God's purposes prevail despite human intentions, and it also prefigures the ultimate blessing through Jesus Christ, who fulfills God's promises to Israel and the nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner who is sought by Balak to curse the Israelites.

Balaam&#8217;s words show a heart hesitating between God&#8217;s revealed will and the lure of worldly honor (<a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>; <a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>please stay here overnight</b><p>&#8211; Balaam asks for time under the guise of spiritual diligence. Yet God had plainly said, &#8220;You are not to curse the people, for they are blessed&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/22-12.htm">Numbers 22:12</a>).<p>&#8211; Delaying obedience frequently masks a hope that God might concede to personal desire (compare Saul in <a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24-25</a>).<p>&#8211; While Scripture commends waiting on the Lord for guidance (<a href="/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4-5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>), it condemns stalling when His will is already revealed (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the others did</b><p>&#8211; Balaam treats the second delegation just like the first (<a href="/numbers/22-8.htm">Numbers 22:8</a>). By repeating the process he creates an impression of consistent piety, though inwardly he covets Balak&#8217;s offer (<a href="/numbers/22-17.htm">Numbers 22:17-18</a>).<p>&#8211; Repetition here is not faithfulness but persistence in seeking a different answer&#8212;echoing Pharaoh&#8217;s pattern of asking Moses to pray, then hardening his heart again (<a href="/exodus/8-8.htm">Exodus 8:8, 15</a>).<p>&#8211; Scripture shows that apparent spiritual routines can hide a divided heart (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I may find out</b><p>&#8211; Balaam frames his request as humble inquiry, but true humility submits to the first word God speaks (<a href="/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a>).<p>&#8211; God does sometimes give further instruction (<a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6-10</a>), yet never contradicts Himself (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). Balaam&#8217;s desire is not for clarity but for permission to compromise.<p>&#8211; This mirrors Balaam&#8217;s later counsel to entice Israel into sin (<a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>), proving his motives were never fully aligned with God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what else the LORD has to tell me</b><p>&#8211; The phrase sounds spiritual yet implies God might revise His moral standard.<p>&#8211; Scripture affirms God&#8217;s word is settled (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>) and His blessing on Israel irrevocable (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>).<p>&#8211; God will indeed speak again&#8212;granting Balaam leave to go (<a href="/numbers/22-20.htm">Numbers 22:20</a>) while turning the journey into judgment, using Balaam&#8217;s own donkey to expose his folly (<a href="/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22-35</a>).<p>&#8211; The episode warns that pressing God for a different answer can result in His permissive &#8220;Yes,&#8221; which brings discipline rather than delight (<a href="/psalms/106-15.htm">Psalm 106:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/22-19.htm">Numbers 22:19</a> reveals a prophet torn between God&#8217;s clear command and personal ambition. Each clause of Balaam&#8217;s request layers pious language over a heart hoping the Lord will soften His stance. Scripture underscores that when God has spoken plainly, further inquiry can become rebellion in disguise. True obedience accepts the first answer, trusts God&#8217;s unchanging word, and resists the temptation to negotiate with divine truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Tarry ye also here this night.--</span>Balaam knew that God was "not a man, that he should lie;
