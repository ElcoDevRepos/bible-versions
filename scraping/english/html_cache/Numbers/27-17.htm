In ancient Israel, a leader was expected to be actively involved in the life of the community, both in times of peace and war. The expression "go out and come in" is a Hebrew idiom for leading in battle and managing the affairs of the people (<a href="/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>). It emphasizes the need for a leader who is present and engaged with the people, ensuring their safety and well-being.<p><b>and who will lead them out and bring them in</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the need for a leader who can guide the people effectively, ensuring their safe passage and return. It underscores the importance of a leader who can provide direction and protection, much like a shepherd with his flock. This imagery is consistent with the role of a king or military leader in ancient Israel, who was responsible for the security and prosperity of the nation. The phrase also foreshadows the role of Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3-4</a>), who leads His followers with care and authority.<p><b>so that the congregation of the LORD</b><br>The term "congregation of the LORD" refers to the assembly of the Israelites, God's chosen people. This phrase emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the people are seen as a community under divine guidance and protection. The congregation is not just a social or political entity but a spiritual one, called to live according to God's laws and purposes. This concept is foundational in understanding the identity and mission of Israel as a nation set apart for God's glory (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>).<p><b>will not be like sheep without a shepherd.</b><br>This simile draws on the pastoral imagery common in the ancient Near East, where sheep without a shepherd are vulnerable to danger and easily scattered. It underscores the necessity of strong, godly leadership to provide guidance, protection, and care for the people. The imagery of sheep and shepherd is prevalent throughout Scripture, symbolizing the relationship between God and His people (Psalm 23, <a href="/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5-6</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus is portrayed as the ultimate Shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), fulfilling the prophetic and pastoral role anticipated in the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is seeking God's guidance for a successor to lead the people into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The individual chosen by God to succeed Moses as the leader of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_congregation_of_the_lord.htm">The Congregation of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who are in need of a leader to guide them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep_without_a_shepherd.htm">Sheep without a Shepherd</a></b><br>A metaphor used to describe the Israelites' need for guidance and leadership.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_godly_leadership.htm">The Importance of Godly Leadership</a></b><br>Godly leadership is essential for guiding and protecting the people of God.

This everyday phrase paints a picture of a leader&#8217;s public life&#8212;visible, active, and accountable.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Going out&#8221; points to leading the people into action&#8212;whether marching, worshiping, or making decisions (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Coming in&#8221; speaks of returning safely, giving reports, and sharing in the community&#8217;s ordinary rhythm (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>).<p>The nation needs someone whose movements are upright and transparent, someone whose life can be imitated.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And who will lead them out and bring them in</b><p>The wording shifts from the leader&#8217;s personal comings and goings to his direct care for the people. Moses longs for a shepherd-style commander:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Lead them out&#8221; &#8211; Guiding Israel into battles, travels, and work (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-11.htm">Joshua 14:11</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Bring them in&#8221; &#8211; Ensuring safe return, rest, and settled inheritance (cf. <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3&#8211;4</a>, where Jesus calls and gathers His sheep).<p>Moses knows the land ahead holds fortified cities and unfamiliar fields. Israel needs a leader who manages risk and reward with courage and tenderness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that the congregation of the LORD will not be like sheep without a shepherd</b><p>The purpose is crystal clear. Without godly leadership, God&#8217;s people scatter and suffer. Scripture repeats this warning:<p>&#8226; Israel under Ahab&#8217;s prophets: &#8220;I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/22-17.htm">1 Kings 22:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Ezekiel&#8217;s lament: the flock became food for every beast when shepherds failed (<a href="/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus, moved with compassion, saw the crowds &#8220;harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>).<p>Moses desires continuity of care, discipline, protection, and direction so the covenant community thrives in the Promised Land.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a> underscores that God&#8217;s people require a visible, active, servant-hearted leader whose life is open before them, whose guidance steers them safely in and out of every venture, and whose presence keeps them from wandering aimlessly. Moses&#8217; prayer for such a shepherd anticipates Joshua&#8212;and ultimately points forward to Christ, the perfect Shepherd-King who fulfills every facet of this verse for His flock.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Which may go out before them . . . --</span>The expression going out and coming in is used here, as in many other places, to denote the ordinary life of man (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-6.htm" title="Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out.">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-2.htm" title="And he said to them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD has said to me, You shall not go over this Jordan.">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>).
