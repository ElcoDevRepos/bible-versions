Her name, meaning "deceiver" or "my lie," reflects the deceitful nature of the incident involving the Israelites and the Midianites. This event is a reminder of the spiritual dangers of intermingling with pagan cultures, which often led Israel astray. The mention of her name highlights the personal nature of the sin and the direct confrontation by Phinehas, who acted zealously for the Lord.<p><b>the daughter of Zur</b><br>Zur is identified as a leader among the Midianites, indicating that Cozbi was of high status. This connection emphasizes the political and social implications of the alliance between the Israelites and the Midianites. Zur's position as a leader suggests that the Midianites were not merely incidental players but were actively involved in leading Israel into sin. This familial connection underscores the broader conflict between Israel and Midian, which is later addressed through divine judgment.<p><b>a tribal chief of a Midianite family</b><br>The reference to Zur as a tribal chief highlights the organized structure of Midianite society and their influence in the region. The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah, and their interactions with Israel were complex, involving both conflict and cooperation at different times. The mention of a tribal chief indicates the significant threat posed by the Midianites, as they were not just a nomadic group but had established leadership and influence. This context sets the stage for the subsequent divine command to treat the Midianites as enemies due to their role in leading Israel into sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cozbi.htm">Cozbi</a></b><br>A Midianite woman who was involved in leading the Israelites into idolatry and immorality.

The verse reminds believers that personal choices, national leadership, and covenant fidelity are inseparably linked, and that sin&#8212;no matter how prestigious its source&#8212;must be dealt with decisively to preserve God&#8217;s people and His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">head of the tribes </span>(or, <span class= "ital">communities</span>)<span class= "ital"> of a father's house in Midian. </span>Several of the Midianitish tribes, or smaller divisions of a father's house, may have descended from one tribe-father.
