The wilderness journey was a time of testing and judgment for the Israelites, as they wandered due to their disobedience and lack of faith in God's promise to enter the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>). The wilderness symbolizes a place of trial and purification, where the older generation of Israelites died because of their unbelief, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/3-17.htm">Hebrews 3:17-19</a>.<p><b>but he was not among the followers of Korah who gathered together against the LORD</b><br>This distinguishes the father of Zelophehad's daughters from those who participated in Korah's rebellion. Korah, along with Dathan and Abiram, led a revolt against Moses and Aaron, challenging their leadership and, by extension, God's authority (<a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16:1-3</a>). The rebellion resulted in a dramatic judgment where the earth swallowed the rebels (<a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a>). This distinction emphasizes that Zelophehad's death was not due to rebellion against God, which is significant in maintaining the integrity of his lineage.<p><b>Instead, he died because of his own sin</b><br>This acknowledges the personal responsibility for sin, a recurring theme in Scripture. While the specific sin of Zelophehad is not detailed, it reflects the broader reality that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). The acknowledgment of personal sin is crucial in the biblical narrative, as it underscores the need for atonement and redemption, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<p><b>and he had no sons</b><br>In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, inheritance and family lineage were typically passed through male descendants. The absence of sons in Zelophehad's family presented a legal and social challenge regarding inheritance rights. This situation led to the daughters of Zelophehad appealing to Moses for the right to inherit their father's land, which resulted in a significant legal precedent in Israelite law (<a href="/numbers/27-7.htm">Numbers 27:7-11</a>). This case highlights the importance of justice and equity in God's law and foreshadows the inclusive nature of God's kingdom, where all, regardless of gender, are heirs through faith in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28-29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zelophehad.htm">Zelophehad</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Manasseh, who died in the wilderness without leaving any sons.

An inheritor from that group would have no standing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Instead, he died because of his own sin</b><p>- Zelophehad shared the ordinary sinfulness of the nation; &#8220;the wages of sin is death&#8221; (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p>- Though not a rebel with Korah, he still bore personal responsibility before God (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>).<p>- The phrase shows that every death in the wilderness, spectacular or ordinary, flowed from sin&#8217;s universal curse (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-7.htm">Psalm 90:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he had no sons</b><p>- In ancient Israel, land inheritance passed through male heirs (<a href="/numbers/26-52.htm">Numbers 26:52-56</a>). Without a son, Zelophehad&#8217;s name and allotment were in jeopardy.<p>- The daughters appeal so their father&#8217;s line will not vanish, leading to God&#8217;s gracious clarification of inheritance law (<a href="/numbers/27-6.htm">Numbers 27:6-11</a>; 36:1-9).<p>- Their request anticipates Christ&#8217;s later inclusion of the &#8220;whosoever&#8221; into God&#8217;s family by faith, regardless of gender or status (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/27-3.htm">Numbers 27:3</a> records the daughters of Zelophehad stating four facts: their father died in the wilderness, he was not part of Korah&#8217;s infamous rebellion, he died for his personal sin like the rest of that generation, and he left no sons. Together these points frame a respectful, faith-filled petition. They acknowledge God&#8217;s past judgments, affirm individual accountability, and seek the preservation of their family&#8217;s inheritance. By honoring their plea, the Lord shows His justice, mercy, and commitment to each name written among His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord.</span> He had not been amongst the two hundred and fifty who gathered themselves together in support of Korah s pretensions. It does not appear why they should have thought it necessary to make this statement, unless they felt that the fact of his having died without sons might raise suspicion against him as one who had greatly provoked the wrath of God. <span class="cmt_word">But died in his own sin.</span> This cannot mean that Zelophehad was one of those who died in the wilderness in consequence of the rebellion at Kadesh (see the next note). Apparently his daughters meant to acknowledge that they had no complaint against the Divine justice because of their father's death, but only against the law because of the unnecessary hardship which it inflicted upon them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/27-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Our father</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
