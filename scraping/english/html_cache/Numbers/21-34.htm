It underscores Moses' role as a prophet and mediator between God and the Israelites. This divine guidance is crucial as Israel navigates the challenges of the wilderness and prepares to enter the Promised Land.<p><b>Do not fear him</b><br>God's command to not fear is a recurring theme in Scripture, often given to leaders and prophets facing daunting challenges. This assurance is meant to bolster Moses' confidence against Og, king of Bashan. It reflects God's sovereignty and faithfulness, reminding Moses and the Israelites that their success depends on divine power, not human strength.<p><b>for I have delivered him into your hand</b><br>This phrase is a declaration of victory before the battle begins, emphasizing God's control over the outcome. It echoes similar assurances given to Joshua and other leaders, reinforcing the idea that God fights for Israel. This preemptive assurance of victory is a testament to God's covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the land.<p><b>along with all his people and his land</b><br>The inclusion of Og's people and land signifies a complete victory, not just a military defeat. This comprehensive deliverance is part of God's plan to establish Israel in the land He promised. It also highlights the importance of land in the biblical narrative, as a tangible sign of God's promise and blessing.<p><b>Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites</b><br>This reference to Sihon serves as a reminder of past victories, encouraging faith in God's continued provision. The defeat of Sihon was a significant event, demonstrating God's power and setting a precedent for future conquests. It also illustrates the pattern of divine assistance in overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles.<p><b>who lived in Heshbon</b><br>Heshbon was a significant city in the region, previously ruled by Sihon. Its mention here situates the narrative in a real geographical context, providing historical credibility. The conquest of Heshbon and its king is a testament to God's promise to give Israel the land of Canaan, fulfilling His covenant with the patriarchs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
