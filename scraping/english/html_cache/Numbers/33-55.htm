The directive is rooted in the need to maintain spiritual purity and avoid the influence of pagan practices. Historically, the Canaanites were known for their idolatry and morally corrupt practices, which posed a significant threat to the Israelites' covenant relationship with God. This command is consistent with earlier instructions found in <a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31-33</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>, where God warns of the dangers of cohabitation with pagan nations.<p><b>those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides</b><br>The imagery of "barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides" is a vivid metaphor for the persistent and painful trouble that the remaining Canaanites would cause the Israelites. This language is echoed in <a href="/joshua/23-13.htm">Joshua 23:13</a> and <a href="/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>, where the consequences of failing to fully obey God's command are realized. The metaphor suggests not only physical but also spiritual and moral distress, as the Canaanites' presence would lead to temptation and eventual apostasy.<p><b>they will harass you in the land where you settle</b><br>This phrase predicts the ongoing conflict and strife that would result from the Israelites' disobedience. Historically, the Israelites faced numerous challenges from the Canaanite peoples, as seen in the Book of Judges, where cycles of oppression and deliverance are recorded. The harassment is not merely physical but also spiritual, as the Israelites are drawn away from God by the influence of Canaanite culture and religion. This serves as a warning of the consequences of incomplete obedience and the importance of faithfulness to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being instructed by Moses as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_inhabitants_of_canaan.htm">The Inhabitants of Canaan</a></b><br>The current residents of the land that God has promised to the Israelites, who are to be driven out.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God has promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, delivering God's commands and warnings to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_journey.htm">The Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The context of this passage, as the Israelites are concluding their 40-year journey through the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>God&#8217;s command to drive out the inhabitants was clear.
