This vow is voluntary and can be taken by both men and women. The term "Nazirite" comes from the Hebrew word "nazir," meaning "consecrated" or "separated." This vow is a form of personal holiness and devotion, setting the individual apart for God's purposes. The concept of separation is significant in the Bible, as it often denotes being set apart for divine service, similar to the consecration of priests.<p><b>no razor shall touch his head</b><br>This phrase indicates one of the key outward signs of the Nazirite vow: the abstention from cutting one's hair. The uncut hair symbolizes the individual's dedication and separation to God. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, hair often held symbolic meaning, representing strength, vitality, and identity. The unshorn hair of a Nazirite serves as a visible reminder of their vow and commitment. This practice is reminiscent of Samson, whose strength was linked to his uncut hair as part of his Nazirite vow (Judges 13-16).<p><b>He must be holy until the time of his separation to the LORD is complete</b><br>Holiness in this context refers to being set apart for God's service. The Nazirite vow required the individual to maintain a state of ritual purity, avoiding contact with dead bodies and abstaining from wine and other products of the vine. This period of holiness underscores the importance of dedication and purity in one's relationship with God. The concept of holiness is central to the biblical narrative, as God calls His people to be holy as He is holy (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<p><b>he must let the hair of his head grow long</b><br>The growing of hair is a physical manifestation of the Nazirite's vow. It serves as a public testament to their commitment and separation to God. The long hair is a symbol of the vow's duration and the individual's ongoing dedication. In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul briefly took a Nazirite vow, as indicated by his shaving of his head in Cenchrea because of a vow he had taken (<a href="/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>). This practice highlights the continuity of the concept of personal vows and dedication across both Testaments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazirite.htm">Nazirite</a></b><br>An individual who takes a special vow of separation to the LORD, characterized by abstaining from wine, not cutting their hair, and avoiding contact with the dead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and commandments from God, including the Nazirite vow.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God to whom the laws, including the Nazirite vow, were given as part of their covenant relationship with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, to whom the vow of separation is dedicated.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vow_of_separation.htm">Vow of Separation</a></b><br>A voluntary commitment made by an individual to set themselves apart for God's service, marked by specific outward signs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The Nazirite vow emphasizes the importance of being set apart for God.

It is not a lifelong command for everyone, but a voluntary, solemn commitment made to God for a specific stretch of time (cf. <a href="/leviticus/27-2.htm">Leviticus 27:2</a>; <a href="/acts/21-23.htm">Acts 21:23-24</a>).<p>- During that span, the Nazarite stepped out of ordinary life for a heightened focus on the LORD. Like Moses removing his sandals (<a href="/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>) or Israel resting every Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-10</a>), the vow created sacred space for undistracted devotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>no razor shall touch his head</b><p>- This outward rule provided a constant, visible reminder of the inner dedication. Just as Israel&#8217;s tassels reminded them of God&#8217;s commands (<a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-40</a>), uncut hair reminded the Nazarite&#8212;and everyone who saw him&#8212;of a life set apart.<p>- It required daily obedience. A razor is small and ordinary, yet abstaining from it turned everyday grooming into an act of worship (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p>- Samson&#8217;s story shows the seriousness of this clause. When Delilah shaved his head, &#8220;his strength left him&#8221; (<a href="/judges/16-17.htm">Judges 16:17-19</a>), underlining that the power of the vow rested in obedience, not in the hair itself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He must be holy until the time of his separation to the LORD is complete</b><p>- &#8220;Holy&#8221; (set apart) highlights purpose. The vow was not chiefly about hair, diet, or abstaining from the dead (<a href="/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3-7</a>); it was about belonging wholly to the LORD (<a href="/psalms/4-3.htm">Psalm 4:3</a>).<p>- Holiness had a finish line: &#8220;until&#8230;complete.&#8221; God honors commitments fulfilled as promised (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>).<p>- This clause guards against legalism on one hand and laxity on the other. The Nazarite must neither break off early nor extend indefinitely to impress others (<a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he must let the hair of his head grow long</b><p>- Long hair was both result and symbol. It accumulated day by day, visually counting the weeks of consecration. In that culture, such hair set the Nazarite apart from prevailing styles, much as John the Baptist&#8217;s garments marked him in his generation (<a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>).<p>- At the vow&#8217;s completion, the hair was shaved and burned beneath the peace offering (<a href="/numbers/6-18.htm">Numbers 6:18</a>), showing that even the sign of dedication ultimately belonged to God.<p>- The apostle Paul may allude to this when honoring a man who vows to grow his hair, then cuts it in Cenchreae after completing a vow (<a href="/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a> teaches that a Nazarite vow involved a clearly defined period of total consecration, visibly expressed by leaving the hair untouched. The uncut hair was a daily, public declaration that the person belonged wholly to the LORD until the vow&#8217;s completion. The verse invites believers today to consider outward and inward ways to live set apart, fulfilling every commitment to God with wholehearted obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">There shall no razor come upon his head.</span>--The hair was to be suffered to grow in all its luxuriance during the days of the Nazirite vow. The meaning may be illustrated by reference to <a href="/context/leviticus/25-4.htm" title="But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest to the land, a sabbath for the LORD: you shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard.">Leviticus 25:4-5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-11.htm" title="A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be to you: you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of your vine undressed.">Leviticus 25:11</a>, where it is prescribed that in the seventh year the vine was not to be pruned, and that the grapes of "the undressed vine" (literally, <span class= "ital">the grapes of the Nazirite</span>) should not be gathered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall no razor come upon his head.</span> The meaning of this law is <span class="cmt_word">best</span> understood from the case of Samson, whose strength was in his hair, and departed from him when his hair was cut. No doubt that strength was a more or less supernatural gift, and it went and came with his hair according to some supernatural law; but it is clear that the connection was not merely arbitrary, but was founded on some generally received idea. To the Jew, differing in this from the shaven Egyptian and the short-haired Greek, the hair represented the virile powers of the adult, growing with its growth, and failing again with its decay. To use a simple analogy from nature, the uncropped locks of the Nazirite were like the mane of the male lion, a symbol of the fullness of his proper strength and life (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25, 26</a>, and, for the disgrace of baldness, <a href="/2_kings/2-23.htm">2 Kings 2:23</a>). In later ages Western and Greek feeling on the subject prevailed over Eastern and Jewish, and a "Hebrew of the Hebrews" was able to argue that "even nature itself" teaches us "that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him" (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-14.htm">1 Corinthians 11:14</a>). No doubt "nature itself" taught the Greek of Corinth that lesson; but no doubt also "nature itself" taught the Jew of Palestine exactly the opposite lesson; and the Apostle himself did not quite discard the earlier sentiment, for he too made a Nazirite vow, and suffered his hair to grow while it lasted (<a href="/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>). The meaning, therefore, of the law was that the whole fullness of the man's vitality was to be dedicated without any diminution to the Lord, as typified by the free growth of his hair. It has been conjectured that it was allowed to the Nazirite to "poll" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) his hair during his vow, although not to "shave" it (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); and in this way the statement is explained that St. Paul "polled his head" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>, compared with Acts 21:24) in Cenchraea, because he had a vow. It is, however, quite evident that any permission to cut the hair is inconsistent with the whole intention of the commandment; for if a man might "poll his head" when he pleased, he would not be distinguished from other men. If it was allowed in the Apostle's time, it is only another instance of the way in Which the commandments of God were made of none effect by the traditions of men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/6-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For the entire</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">period</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his vow</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1462;&#1443;&#1491;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ne&#183;&#7695;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5088.htm">Strong's 5088: </a> </span><span class="str2">A promise, a thing promised</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of separation,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1512;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(niz&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
