His role as a mediator is significant, reflecting the intercessory role of Christ. Moses' dialogue with God shows his intimate relationship with the Divine, a privilege that underscores his unique position among the Israelites.<p><b>Here I am among 600,000 men on foot</b><br>The number 600,000 refers to the men of military age, not including women and children, suggesting a total population of over two million. This vast number highlights the logistical challenges Moses faced. The phrase "on foot" emphasizes their status as travelers and wanderers in the wilderness, dependent on God's provision. This mirrors the Christian journey of faith, relying on God's guidance and sustenance.<p><b>yet You say, &#8216;I will give them meat</b><br>God's promise to provide meat is a test of faith for Moses and the Israelites. It recalls the miraculous provision of manna, demonstrating God's ability to provide beyond human understanding. This promise foreshadows the New Testament miracle of the feeding of the 5,000, where Jesus provides abundantly, symbolizing spiritual nourishment.<p><b>and they will eat for a month.&#8217;</b><br>The duration of a month signifies a complete cycle, suggesting God's provision is not just temporary but sufficient and complete. This promise challenges Moses' faith, as it seems impossible from a human perspective. It points to the sufficiency of God's provision, a theme echoed in <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>, where God supplies all needs according to His riches in glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.

One evening of quail might be luck; thirty days is obviously God (<a href="/psalms/78-26.htm">Psalm 78:26-29</a> recounts the fulfillment).<p>- It also serves as a gentle warning: their craving will be satisfied to the point of disgust (<a href="/numbers/11-19.htm">Numbers 11:19-20</a>), mirroring <a href="/psalms/106-15.htm">Psalm 106:15</a>&#8212;&#8220;He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.&#8221;<p>- The phrase anticipates how God often answers abundantly yet teaches through the abundance (<a href="/proverbs/30-8.htm">Proverbs 30:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/11-21.htm">Numbers 11:21</a> captures a moment when Moses, overwhelmed by sheer numbers and practical concerns, voices doubt about God&#8217;s ability to feed Israel for an entire month. The verse spotlights the contrast between human limitation and divine sufficiency. God&#8217;s faithfulness in past provisions, His clear promise in the present, and His pattern throughout Scripture all converge to show that no logistical challenge can thwart His word.
