The Kohathites were one of the major divisions of the Levites, who were set apart for religious duties. The Kohathites had the special responsibility of caring for the most sacred objects of the tabernacle, including the Ark of the Covenant, the table of showbread, the lampstand, and the altars. This role highlights the importance of the Kohathites in maintaining the spiritual life of Israel. The division into clans indicates a structured organization within the tribe, which was necessary for the orderly conduct of their duties.<p><b>were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel</b><br>Amram is perhaps the most notable of Kohath's sons, as he was the father of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, key figures in the Exodus narrative. This connection underscores the significant role the Kohathites played in Israel's history. Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel are less prominent in the biblical narrative, but their mention here indicates their importance in the genealogical and tribal structure of Israel. Each of these clans would have had specific roles and responsibilities within the broader duties of the Kohathites. The mention of these names also serves to authenticate the historical record, as genealogies were crucial for maintaining tribal identity and inheritance rights in ancient Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kohath.htm">Kohath</a></b><br>Kohath was one of the sons of Levi, making him a grandson of Jacob.
