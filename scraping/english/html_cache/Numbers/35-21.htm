In ancient Israelite law, the motive was crucial in determining guilt. Hostility implies premeditation or malice, distinguishing murder from accidental killing. This reflects the broader biblical principle that God judges the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The act of striking with the hand suggests a personal and direct form of violence, emphasizing the personal nature of the crime.<p><b>the one who struck him must surely be put to death; he is a murderer</b><br>The mandate for capital punishment underscores the sanctity of life, a principle rooted in <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, where God establishes that whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed. This reflects the seriousness with which God views murder, as humans are made in His image. The certainty of the punishment ("must surely be put to death") indicates the non-negotiable nature of justice in this context.<p><b>When the avenger of blood finds the murderer, he is to kill him</b><br>The "avenger of blood" (Hebrew: go'el ha-dam) was typically a close relative of the deceased, tasked with executing justice. This practice was part of the ancient Near Eastern legal systems and served as a deterrent against murder. It also maintained family honor and societal order. The role of the avenger is a precursor to the legal systems that would later develop, where the state assumes the role of executing justice. This system also foreshadows the ultimate justice and redemption found in Christ, who, as the ultimate Avenger, will bring final justice and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_murderer.htm">The Murderer</a></b><br>The individual who intentionally kills another person out of hostility.
