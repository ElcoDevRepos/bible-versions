The LORD's commands through Moses highlight the importance of obedience to God's instructions. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's covenant with Israel, where Moses serves as the intermediary. The phrase underscores the necessity of following God's directives precisely, as seen in other instances such as the construction of the Tabernacle (Exodus 25-31).<p><b>This was to be a reminder to the Israelites</b><br>The purpose of the command is to serve as a perpetual reminder to the Israelites. Reminders are a common biblical motif, used to reinforce God's laws and the consequences of disobedience. This is similar to the use of memorial stones in <a href="/joshua/4-7.htm">Joshua 4:7</a>, which served to remind future generations of God's faithfulness and mighty acts.<p><b>that no outsider who is not a descendant of Aaron</b><br>This phrase establishes the exclusive role of the Aaronic priesthood in performing certain sacred duties. The descendants of Aaron were set apart for the priestly service, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28-29</a>. This exclusivity underscores the holiness required to approach God, a theme that is echoed in the New Testament with the priesthood of all believers through Christ (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>should approach to offer incense before the LORD,</b><br>Offering incense was a priestly duty, symbolizing the prayers of the people ascending to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>).
