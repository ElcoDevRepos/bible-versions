The Israelites are the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, and are central to the Old Testament narrative. This phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God provides laws and instructions for His people to follow.<p><b>and tell them that throughout the generations to come</b><br>This phrase indicates the perpetual nature of the commandment. It is not limited to the immediate generation but is intended for all future descendants of Israel. This continuity highlights the enduring nature of God's laws and the importance of tradition in maintaining a connection with God across time.<p><b>they are to make for themselves tassels</b><br>Tassels, or "tzitzit" in Hebrew, are physical reminders of the commandments. They serve as a tangible symbol of the Israelites' commitment to God's laws. The use of tassels is a form of visual and tactile reinforcement of spiritual principles, helping the Israelites to remember and observe God's commandments in their daily lives.<p><b>for the corners of their garments</b><br>The corners, or "kanaph" in Hebrew, refer to the edges of the outer garment, typically a cloak or robe. This placement is significant as it ensures the tassels are visible and accessible, serving as a constant reminder of God's laws. The corners symbolize the extremities of one's life, suggesting that God's commandments should encompass all aspects of existence.<p><b>with a blue cord on each tassel</b><br>The blue cord, or "tekhelet," is traditionally made from a dye derived from a specific sea creature, possibly the Murex snail. Blue is a color often associated with divinity and the heavens, symbolizing a connection to God. The inclusion of the blue cord in the tassels serves as a reminder of the divine origin of the commandments and the Israelites' call to holiness. This color is also used in the tabernacle and priestly garments, further linking the tassels to worship and service to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received the law from God and communicated it to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given specific commandments to follow as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tassels.htm">Tassels</a></b><br>Fringes or threads attached to the corners of garments, serving as a physical reminder of God's commandments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/blue_cord.htm">Blue Cord</a></b><br>A specific element of the tassels, symbolizing heavenly authority and divine commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/generations_to_come.htm">Generations to Come</a></b><br>Indicates the perpetual nature of this commandment, emphasizing its importance for all future descendants of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reminder_of_god's_commandments.htm">Reminder of God's Commandments</a></b><br>The tassels serve as a physical reminder to keep God's commandments, encouraging believers to find ways to keep God's Word at the forefront of their daily lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbol_of_holiness.htm">Symbol of Holiness</a></b><br>The blue cord represents a call to holiness and separation unto God, urging Christians to live distinctively in a way that reflects their faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_faithfulness.htm">Generational Faithfulness</a></b><br>The commandment to wear tassels "throughout the generations" underscores the importance of passing down faith and obedience to future generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heart_over_appearance.htm">Heart over Appearance</a></b><br>While the tassels are an outward sign, the true focus should be on the heart's obedience to God, reminding believers to prioritize inner transformation over external appearances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_fulfillment.htm">Christ as Fulfillment</a></b><br>The law, including the command to wear tassels, points to Christ, who fulfills the law.

And you shall teach them diligently to your children&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>).<p>- Truth must move from revelation to proclamation; silence would leave the nation ignorant of an important safeguard (<a href="/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7-9</a>).<p>- Moses models faithful transmission of God&#8217;s Word, a pattern later mirrored by the prophets and ultimately fulfilled in Christ who said, &#8220;I have made You known to them&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-26.htm">John 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that throughout the generations to come</b><p>- The command is perpetual, stretching far beyond the wilderness era, just as Passover was declared &#8220;a memorial&#8230; for all generations&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>).<p>- Every generation would visibly carry this reminder, keeping God&#8217;s covenant front-and-center (<a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4-7</a>).<p>- It provides continuity: when parents obey, children ask &#8220;Why?&#8221; and the story of redemption is retold (<a href="/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they are to make for themselves tassels</b><p>- Obedience is personal; each Israelite takes responsibility rather than outsourcing holiness.

Earthly obedience is anchored in a vision of God&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-3</a>).<p>- Adding the blue thread prevents mere ritualism; it injects meaning, reminding Israel that they belong to a King and a kingdom not of this world (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38</a> establishes a lasting, visible reminder that God&#8217;s people are to live distinctly under His rule.

It appears to have been commonly used with a hole in the centre, through which the head was put, so that one-half covered the front and the other the back of the body. These tassels, or fringes (LXX. <span class= "greekheb">????????</span><span class= "ital">--craspeda</span>), were enlarged by the Pharisees to exhibit their punctilious fulfilment of the Law (Matt. xiii 5).

It seems to signify something flower-like and bright, like the blooms on a shrub; the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e6;</span>. is applied to the shining plate of gold upon Aaron's head-band (<a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>).

The exact meaning must be gathered from the context, and on the whole that suggests a tassel rather than a fringe. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span>, used in the parallel passage <a href="/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>, seems to have this meaning. The Septuagint renders it by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, which is adopted in the Gospels (see on Matthew 23:5). <span class="cmt_word">In the borders of their garments.</span> Literally, "on the wings," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>.

It was also used as a coverlet by the poor (<a href="/exodus/22-27.htm">Exodus 22:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband</span> <span class="cmt_word">of blue.</span> Rather, "that they put a string (or thread) of hyacinth-blue upon the tassel of the wing."

This may have been a blue string with which to fasten the tassel to the corner of the garment, as if it were the stalk on which this flower grew; or it may have been a prominent blue thread in the tassel itself. The later Jews seem to have understood it in this sense, and concerned themselves greatly with the symbolical arrangements of the blue and other threads, and the method in which they were knotted together, so as to set forth the whole law with all its several commandments.
