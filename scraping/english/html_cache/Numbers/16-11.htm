The context is the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt. The rebellion is not merely against human leaders but against God Himself, as Moses was appointed by God to lead His people. This highlights the seriousness of the rebellion, as it challenges divine authority. The use of "conspired" indicates a deliberate and organized effort to undermine God's chosen leadership. This rebellion can be seen as a type of the ultimate rebellion against God, which is sin. The phrase also echoes the theme of authority and submission found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>, where believers are instructed to submit to governing authorities as they are established by God.<p><b>As for Aaron, who is he that you should grumble against him?&#8221;</b><br>Aaron, the brother of Moses, was appointed by God as the first high priest of Israel. The question posed here emphasizes Aaron's role as a servant of God, not someone who sought power for himself. The grumbling against Aaron reflects a deeper issue of discontent and lack of trust in God's provision and plan. This mirrors the Israelites' frequent complaints during their wilderness journey, as seen in <a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a> and <a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>. Aaron's role as high priest is a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest, as explained in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>. The grumbling against Aaron can be seen as a foreshadowing of the rejection and opposition Jesus faced during His earthly ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah.htm">Korah</a></b><br>A Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, challenging their leadership and the priesthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the appointed high priest, serving as a mediator between God and the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were often rebellious and discontent during their journey in the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among His people, where Aaron and his sons served as priests.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_god-ordained_leadership.htm">Respect for God-Ordained Leadership</a></b><br>God appoints leaders for His purposes, and rebelling against them is akin to rebelling against God Himself.

Moses has just reminded them that God Himself set Aaron apart for priestly service (vv. 8-10). Because that truth is settled, the conclusion follows: their opposition cannot be brushed off as a personality clash&#8212;it is rebellion against the divine order God established (compare <a href="/romans/13-2.htm">Romans 13:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it is you</b><p>Moses pinpoints the ringleader. Korah and the 250 chiefs had tried to disguise their revolt as a community concern, but God exposes sin personally. Scripture often singles out leaders who lure others into disobedience&#8212;think of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7-20.htm">Joshua 7:20-26</a> or Ananias in <a href="/acts/5-3.htm">Acts 5:3-4</a>. Personal accountability before the Lord is never lost in the crowd.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all your followers</b><p>Rebellion spreads; those who align themselves with it share its guilt. <a href="/numbers/16-2.htm">Numbers 16:2</a> stresses that the 250 were &#8220;well-known community leaders.&#8221; Influence magnifies responsibility (<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>). Much like the people who sided with Absalom against David (<a href="/2_samuel/15-13.htm">2 Samuel 15:13</a>), these followers chose popularity over fidelity to God&#8217;s clear commands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who have conspired against the LORD!</b><p>The heart of the matter: the plot is not merely against Moses&#8217; leadership style or Aaron&#8217;s family privilege; it is treason against the covenant Lord. When Israel later demanded a king, God told Samuel, &#8220;they have rejected Me&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>). Complaints aimed horizontally often mask a vertical rejection of God&#8217;s authority. <a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 11</a> warns of &#8220;Korah&#8217;s rebellion&#8221; as a timeless example of this deadly attitude.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As for Aaron</b><p>Aaron&#8217;s role was not self-chosen; God called him (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). By drawing attention back to Aaron, Moses underscores divine appointment. <a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a> reminds us, &#8220;No one takes this honor upon himself.&#8221; In other words, attacking Aaron is pointless because his position rests on God&#8217;s decree, not human ambition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who is he that you should grumble against him?</b><p>Moses&#8217; rhetorical question exposes the absurdity of their complaint. Aaron, in himself, is only a man; the true target of their grumbling is God who placed Aaron where he is (compare <a href="/exodus/16-8.htm">Exodus 16:8</a>, where Moses says, &#8220;Your grumbling is not against us but against the LORD&#8221;). <a href="/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14</a> calls believers to &#8220;do everything without complaining,&#8221; precisely because murmuring questions God&#8217;s wisdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/16-11.htm">Numbers 16:11</a> peels back the layers of Korah&#8217;s uprising to reveal its core: rejecting God&#8217;s appointed order equals rebellion against God Himself. Whether leader or follower, each person stands accountable. Opposition masquerading as mere dissatisfaction is, in reality, a conspiracy against the Lord who sovereignly assigns roles. Rather than grumbling, God&#8217;s people are called to trust His arrangements and honor those He appoints.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For which cause both thou and all</span> <span class="cmt_word">thy company are gathered together.</span> It does not follow that Korah was seeking an exclusive dignity for himself; or for his tribe. His "company" apparently included representative men from all the tribes, or at least from many (see on verse 2). They were seeking the priesthood because they affirmed it to be the common possession of all Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">Against the Lord.</span> It was in his name that they appeared, and to some extent no doubt sincerely; but since they appeared to dispute an ordinance actually and historically made by God himself, it was indeed against him that they were gathered. <span class="cmt_word">And what is</span> <span class="cmt_word">Aaron,</span> <span class="cmt_word">that ye murmur against him?</span> The construction is broken, as so often when we have the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of Moses, whose meekness did not enable him to speak calmly under provocation. The sentence runs, "For which cause thou and all thy company who arc gathered against the Lord, - and Aaron, who is he, that ye murmur against him?" It was easy to represent the position of Aaron in an invidious light, as though they were assailing some personal sacerdotal pretensions; but in truth he was only a poor servant of God doing what he was bid. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/16-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1431;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it is you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
