The concept of offerings is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where offerings were a way to honor God and acknowledge His provision. This act of giving is a form of worship and obedience, reflecting the Israelites' covenant relationship with God. The offerings were a tangible expression of gratitude and recognition of God's sovereignty.<p><b>from all the tithes you receive from the Israelites</b><br>The Levites, who were responsible for the spiritual leadership and service in the tabernacle, received tithes from the other tribes of Israel as their inheritance (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>). This system ensured that those who served in the temple were supported by the community. The tithe, a tenth of one's produce or earnings, was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures, but for Israel, it was a commandment from God, signifying trust and dependence on Him.<p><b>and from these you are to give the LORD&#8217;s offering</b><br>The Levites, in turn, were required to give a portion of the tithes they received as an offering to the LORD. This demonstrates the principle that everyone, regardless of their role or position, is called to give back to God. It underscores the idea that all blessings ultimately come from God and should be used to honor Him. This offering from the Levites was a way to sanctify the tithes they received, acknowledging that their provision was also from God.<p><b>to Aaron the priest</b><br>Aaron, as the high priest, represented the people before God and was responsible for the most sacred duties in the tabernacle. The offering given to Aaron symbolized the support of the priestly ministry, which was essential for maintaining the spiritual health of the nation. This provision for Aaron and his descendants ensured that the priesthood could function without distraction, focusing on their duties of intercession and sacrifice. The priesthood of Aaron is a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest, interceding on our behalf before God (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, from whom the Levites receive tithes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart for religious duties, receiving tithes from the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_the_priest.htm">Aaron the Priest</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, representing the priestly line.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, to whom offerings are ultimately given.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tithe.htm">The Tithe</a></b><br>A tenth of the produce or income, given as an offering to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_giving_back_to_god.htm">The Principle of Giving Back to God</a></b><br>The Levites, though recipients of tithes, are instructed to give a portion back to God, highlighting the principle that all we receive is ultimately from Him and should be used for His glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priesthood.htm">The Role of the Priesthood</a></b><br>Aaron and his descendants are set apart to receive offerings, symbolizing the importance of supporting those who minister in spiritual matters.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cycle_of_blessing.htm">The Cycle of Blessing</a></b><br>The act of giving is a cycle;

The Levites received Israel&#8217;s tithes, yet they still offered a portion back to God, supporting Aaron&#8217;s priestly ministry. The verse upholds stewardship, accountability, and the ongoing divine pattern of providing for those who serve at His altar.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall give thereof the Lord's heave offering to Aaron the priest.</span> The Levites tithed the people, the priests tithed the Levites. At this time the other Israelites were nearly fifty times as numerous as the Levites, and therefore they would have been exceptionally well provided for. It must be remembered, however, that the Levites would naturally increase faster than the rest, not being exposed to the same dangers; and still more that tithes are never paid at all fully or generally, even when of strict legal obligation. A glance along the history of Israel after the conquest will satisfy us that at no time could the people at large be trusted to pay their tithes, unless it were during the ascendancy of the Maccabees, and afterwards under the influence of the Pharisees (cf. <a href="/malachi/3-9.htm">Malachi 3:9, 10</a>). The Levites, indeed, appear in the history of Israel as the reverse of an opulent or influential class. It was no doubt much easier for the sons of Aaron to obtain their tithes from the Levites; and as these were very numerous in proportion, and the tithes themselves were only a part of their revenues, the priests should have been, and in later times certainly were, sufficiently rich. If they were devout they no doubt spent much on the service of the altar and of the sanctuary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/18-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are to present</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;r&#238;&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7311.htm">Strong's 7311: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be high actively, to rise, raise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an offering</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;ma&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8641.htm">Strong's 8641: </a> </span><span class="str2">Contribution, offering (for sacred uses)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from every</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mik&#183;k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
