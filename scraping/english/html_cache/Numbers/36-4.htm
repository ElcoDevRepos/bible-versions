It was a year when debts were forgiven, slaves were freed, and land was returned to its original family owners (<a href="/leviticus/25-8.htm">Leviticus 25:8-13</a>). This concept underscores God's desire for economic and social balance among His people. The Jubilee reflects God's sovereignty over the land and His provision for His people, ensuring that no family would permanently lose their inheritance. It also foreshadows the ultimate liberation and restoration found in Christ, who proclaimed the "year of the Lord's favor" (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>).<p><b>their inheritance will be added to the tribe into which they marry</b><br>This phrase addresses the concern of land inheritance when daughters marry outside their tribe. In the context of <a href="/numbers/36.htm">Numbers 36</a>, the daughters of Zelophehad were granted the right to inherit their father's land, but if they married men from other tribes, their inheritance would transfer to their husbands' tribes. This provision was to prevent the permanent loss of tribal land, maintaining the integrity of the tribal allotments given by God. It highlights the importance of land as a divine gift and a symbol of God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>and taken away from the tribe of our fathers.</b><br>The concern here is the potential diminishment of a tribe's inheritance if land is transferred through marriage. This reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society, where land and inheritance were typically passed through male lineage. The preservation of tribal boundaries was crucial for maintaining the identity and stability of each tribe. This regulation ensured that the land remained within the original tribal allotments, as established by God through Moses and Joshua (Joshua 13-21). It also emphasizes the importance of family and tribal heritage in God's covenantal promises to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daughters_of_zelophehad.htm">The Daughters of Zelophehad</a></b><br>These women were the daughters of Zelophehad, who had no sons.

God&#8217;s calendar never slips, so His promises about land redistribution remain certain (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-45</a>). The verse assumes the literal reality of that future year&#8212;an event the entire nation would anticipate together.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their inheritance will be added to the tribe into which they marry</b><p>The daughters of Zelophehad (<a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-7</a>) were free to marry, yet their marriages would merge their inherited land into their husbands&#8217; tribal territory.<p>&#8226; Marriage merged not only people but property (<a href="/ruth/4-9.htm">Ruth 4:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Tribal boundaries mattered because God Himself had drawn them (<a href="/numbers/34-1.htm">Numbers 34:1-2</a>).<p>So if one of these women married a man from, say, Judah, her family&#8217;s land in Manasseh would shift to Judah at the Jubilee.

God&#8217;s commandments ensured that every tribe retained the inheritance He assigned, illustrating His faithfulness to keep promises, His wisdom in structuring society, and the importance of honoring His boundaries in even the most personal choices.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be.</span>--Up to the year of jubile it was possible that the inheritance might revert to the tribe of Manasseh, either by purchase, or as the result of the marriages of the daughters proving childless. At the jubile the transfer of the inheritance to the tribe or tribes into which the daughters of Zelophehad might have married would become permanent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be.</span> It is remarkable that this is the only reference by name to the Jubilee (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>, <span class="accented">jubeel</span>; not jubilee, which is the vulgar form of the same word derived from the Latin <span class="accented">jubiheus</span>) to be found in the Scriptures. Some allusions more or less doubtful have been pointed out in the prophets, but the only one which seems incontrovertible is in <a href="/ezekiel/46-17.htm">Ezekiel 46:17</a>, and belongs to the ideal regime of that vision. Jeremiah's right of redemption over the lands of his family was probably due to the fact that they were priestly lands (<a href="/joshua/21-18.htm">Joshua 21:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-7.htm">Jeremiah 32:7-9</a>), and as such incapable of permanent alienation. It is, therefore, doubtful whether the Jubilee was ever actually observed, although the principle upon which it rested, the equity of redemption which no Israelite could divest himself of, was undoubtedly acknowledged (see notes on Leviticus 25). <span class="cmt_word">Then shall their inheritance</span> <span class="cmt_word">be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received.</span> It is again remarkable that the one explicit reference to the Jubilee should be only to an indirect consequence of its practical working. The Jubilee could not really transfer the property of the heiress to her husband's tribe, but it would in effect confirm that transfer, and make it permanent. In practice no property would be considered to have finally changed hands until the year of Jubilee, when an extensive re-settlement took place, and when all titles not successfully challenged would be considered as confirmed. Since the title of the heiress's children could not be challenged, and since any intermediate disposition of the land must then determine, the Jubilee would seem to effect the transfer of which it compelled the recognition. It is, however, none the less strange that the Manassites should have laid such stress upon the practical effects of a piece of legislation which had never yet come into use. It seems to point to the conclusion that the same thing had been customary among them in their Egyptian homes, and that they were acquainted, at least by tradition, with its actual working. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/36-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
