The census was a divine command to count the new generation of Israelites after the previous generation had perished in the wilderness due to their disobedience (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>). This act of numbering was significant for organizing the tribes for military purposes and for the distribution of the Promised Land. It highlights the leadership roles of Moses as the prophet and Eleazar as the priest, emphasizing the collaboration between civil and religious leadership in Israel.<p><b>when they counted the Israelites</b><br>The counting of the Israelites was a practical necessity for the allocation of land and resources. It also served as a reminder of God's faithfulness in preserving a new generation to enter the Promised Land. The census was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham to make his descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). It underscores the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God's commands, as the previous generation's failure to trust God resulted in their exclusion from the land.<p><b>on the plains of Moab</b><br>The plains of Moab were located east of the Jordan River, opposite Jericho. This area was significant as the final encampment of the Israelites before crossing into the Promised Land. Moab was a region with a complex relationship with Israel, sometimes hostile and at other times neutral. The location signifies a transitional phase for the Israelites, poised to enter the land promised to their ancestors. It also serves as a backdrop for the events in the Book of Deuteronomy, where Moses delivers his final speeches.<p><b>by the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River was a critical geographical boundary for the Israelites, representing the threshold to the Promised Land. Crossing the Jordan was symbolic of entering into God's promises and leaving behind the wilderness experience. The river is often associated with new beginnings and spiritual renewal, as seen later in the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>), which took place in the Jordan, symbolizing the start of His public ministry.<p><b>across from Jericho</b><br>Jericho was the first city conquered by the Israelites in the Promised Land, known for its fortified walls and strategic location. The mention of Jericho foreshadows the upcoming military campaigns and the miraculous victory that God would provide (Joshua 6). Jericho's conquest is a testament to God's power and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to Israel. It also serves as a type of spiritual warfare, where faith and obedience lead to victory over seemingly insurmountable obstacles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
