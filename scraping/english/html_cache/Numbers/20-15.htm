This move was initially a means of survival and was orchestrated by God through Joseph, who had risen to power in Egypt. The journey to Egypt was significant in the history of Israel, marking the beginning of their transformation from a family into a nation. It also fulfilled God's earlier promise to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>).<p><b>where we lived many years</b><br>The Israelites resided in Egypt for approximately 430 years (<a href="/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40-41</a>). During this time, they grew from a small family group into a large population, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). This period in Egypt was crucial for the development of Israel's identity as a people set apart for God's purposes.<p><b>The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers</b><br>The mistreatment began after the death of Joseph, when a new Pharaoh, who did not know Joseph, came to power (<a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8</a>). Fearing the growing number of Israelites, the Egyptians subjected them to harsh slavery and oppression. This oppression included forced labor and the decree to kill all newborn Hebrew boys (<a href="/exodus/1-9.htm">Exodus 1:9-22</a>). The suffering of the Israelites in Egypt is a central theme in the narrative of the Exodus, highlighting God's deliverance and faithfulness. This period of suffering also serves as a type of the bondage of sin, from which Christ delivers believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the children of Israel, who are recounting their history and experiences in Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites lived for many years, initially as guests during Joseph's time, but later as slaves under oppressive Pharaohs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptian_oppression.htm">The Egyptian Oppression</a></b><br>The period during which the Israelites were enslaved and mistreated by the Egyptians, leading to their eventual cry for deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/remembering_our_past.htm">Remembering Our Past</a></b><br>Reflect on how God has been faithful in past trials and tribulations.
