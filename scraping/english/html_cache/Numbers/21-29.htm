Moab was often in conflict with Israel, and this lament reflects the consequences of their opposition to God's people. The use of "woe" is a common biblical expression of impending doom or divine judgment, seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>You are destroyed, O people of Chemosh!</b><br>Chemosh was the national deity of the Moabites, often associated with war and destruction. The destruction of Moab is linked to their reliance on this false god, highlighting the biblical theme that idolatry leads to downfall. This echoes the broader biblical narrative where nations that oppose God and His people face judgment.<p><b>He gave up his sons as refugees,</b><br>This phrase indicates the scattering and displacement of the Moabite people. The imagery of sons becoming refugees suggests a complete societal breakdown. In the ancient Near East, being forced into exile was a severe punishment, often seen as a sign of divine disfavor. This reflects the consequences of Moab's actions against Israel.<p><b>and his daughters into captivity</b><br>The captivity of daughters signifies the loss of future generations and the shame brought upon the nation. In biblical times, captivity often meant being taken as slaves or concubines, a fate that underscores the totality of Moab's defeat. This serves as a warning against the pride and rebellion against God.<p><b>to Sihon king of the Amorites.</b><br>Sihon was a powerful Amorite king who had previously defeated Moab and taken their land. This historical context shows the shifting power dynamics in the region and serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over nations. The defeat by Sihon is a precursor to Israel's eventual victory over him, demonstrating God's plan to give the land to His chosen people. This also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over all spiritual enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation descended from Lot, often in conflict with Israel.

Scripture frames them as &#8220;people of Chemosh&#8221; to spotlight the emptiness of their worship (<a href="/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The declaration &#8220;You are destroyed&#8221; shows that an idol is powerless to protect its devotees; in fact, Chemosh himself &#8220;goes into exile&#8221; when Moab falls (<a href="/jeremiah/48-13.htm">Jeremiah 48:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Idolatry always ends in defeat because it substitutes a lifeless god for the living God (<a href="/psalms/96-5.htm">Psalm 96:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He gave up his sons as refugees, and his daughters into captivity</b><p>&#8226; Moab&#8217;s own god is pictured as surrendering his people&#8212;an ironic portrayal that underlines Chemosh&#8217;s impotence.<p>&#8226; Historically, Sihon had already seized Moabite territory before Israel arrived (<a href="/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a>). Families were uprooted, sons fled, daughters were hauled away (compare <a href="/lamentations/1-5.htm">Lamentations 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; This captivity previews later judgments against Moab (<a href="/jeremiah/48-46.htm">Jeremiah 48:46-47</a>) and illustrates a principle: trusting idols leads to the loss of what we most want to protect.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Sihon king of the Amorites.</b><p>&#8226; Sihon was infamous for military might (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-26.htm">Deuteronomy 2:26-31</a>). God used him as an instrument to chastise Moab, then turned and delivered Sihon into Israel&#8217;s hand (<a href="/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The sequence shows God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty: He can employ one pagan nation to judge another, and then judge that very instrument to bless His people (<a href="/amos/2-9.htm">Amos 2:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; For Israel, this line reinforced confidence that the Lord who toppled Moab and Sihon would likewise secure Canaan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a> reveals a layered message: Moab&#8217;s proud reliance on Chemosh ended in utter ruin, their families scattered, and their land lost to Sihon&#8212;who himself soon fell before Israel. The verse testifies that idols fail, God reigns, and His purposes for His people stand firm.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O people</span> <span class="cmt_word">of Chemosh.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. Chemosh was the national god of the Moabites (<a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>), and also to some extent of the Ammonites (<a href="/judges/11-24.htm">Judges 11:24</a>). It is generally agreed that the name is derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5e9;</span>, to subdue, and thus will have substantially the same meaning as Milcom, Molech, and Baal; indeed it appears probable that there was a strong family likeness among the idolatries of Palestine, and that the various names represented different attributes of one supreme being rather than different divinities. Thus Baal and Ashtaroth (<a href="/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>) represented for the Zidonians the masculine and feminine elements respectively in the Divine energy. Baal himself was plural (Baalim, <a href="/1_kings/18-18.htm">1 Kings 18:18</a>) in form, and either male or female (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;</span> in <a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>; <a href="/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4</a>). In the inscription on the Moabite stone a god "Ashtar-Chemosh" is mentioned, and thus Chemosh is identified with the male deity of Phoenicia (Ashtar being the masculine form of Ashtoreth), while, on the other hand, it was almost certainly the same divinity who was worshipped under another name, and with other rites, as Baal-Peor (see on Numbers 25:3). On the coins of Areopolis Chemosh appears as a god of war armed, with fire-torches by his side.
