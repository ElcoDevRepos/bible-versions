This lineage emphasizes the continuity of the priestly role and the importance of maintaining holiness among the Israelites. The priesthood was central to Israelite worship and maintaining the covenant relationship with God. Phinehas's actions are seen as upholding the sanctity of this office.<p><b>has turned My wrath away from the Israelites</b><br>Phinehas's intervention stopped a plague that had begun as a result of Israel's sin with the Moabite women and their worship of Baal of Peor. His decisive action in killing an Israelite man and a Midianite woman who were blatantly defying God's commands was seen as an act of righteousness that appeased God's anger. This reflects the biblical principle that sin incurs divine wrath, but righteous action can restore favor.<p><b>for he was zealous for My sake among them</b><br>Phinehas's zeal is highlighted as being for God's sake, indicating his deep commitment to God's holiness and commands. This zeal is reminiscent of other biblical figures who acted passionately for God's honor, such as Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>) and Jesus cleansing the temple (<a href="/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>). Zeal for God is portrayed as a commendable trait when it aligns with divine purposes.<p><b>so that I did not consume the Israelites in My zeal</b><br>God's zeal, or intense passion for His holiness and covenant, could have led to the destruction of the Israelites due to their sin. However, Phinehas's actions served as a form of intercession, preventing further judgment. This reflects the biblical theme of intercession, where individuals stand in the gap to avert God's wrath, as seen with Moses (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>) and ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who intercedes for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/phinehas.htm">Phinehas</a></b><br>The grandson of Aaron, the high priest, and son of Eleazar.
