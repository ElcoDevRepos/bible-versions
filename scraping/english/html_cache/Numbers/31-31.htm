Moses represents the civil authority, while Eleazar represents the religious authority. This dual leadership reflects the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where governance and worship were intertwined. Eleazar's role as high priest is significant, as he succeeded his father Aaron and was responsible for maintaining the spiritual purity of the people. This partnership between Moses and Eleazar underscores the importance of both civil and religious obedience to God's commands.<p><b>did as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the obedience of Moses and Eleazar to God's instructions. In the context of <a href="/numbers/31.htm">Numbers 31</a>, God commanded the Israelites to take vengeance on the Midianites, who had led them into idolatry and immorality (Numbers 25). The obedience of Moses and Eleazar is a recurring theme in the Pentateuch, highlighting the importance of following divine directives. This obedience is also a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the will of the Father (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>). The phrase serves as a reminder of the necessity of adhering to God's commands, as disobedience often led to dire consequences for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.
