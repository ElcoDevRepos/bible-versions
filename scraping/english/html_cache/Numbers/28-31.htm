This practice symbolized the pouring out of one's life in devotion to God. The drink offering is often associated with joy and celebration, reflecting the abundance and blessings from God. In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul uses the imagery of a drink offering to describe his own life being poured out in service to Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>).<p><b>in addition to the regular burnt offering and its grain offering.</b><br>The regular burnt offering, also known as the "continual burnt offering," was a daily sacrifice made every morning and evening (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>). It served as a constant reminder of the need for atonement and the people's dedication to God. The grain offering, often made of fine flour mixed with oil and frankincense, symbolized the fruits of human labor and thanksgiving to God. Together, these offerings represented a comprehensive act of worship, combining atonement, dedication, and gratitude.<p><b>The animals must be unblemished.</b><br>The requirement for unblemished animals underscores the importance of offering God the best and purest sacrifices, reflecting His holiness and perfection. This stipulation points to the future sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described as the "Lamb without blemish or defect" (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). The unblemished nature of the sacrificial animals in the Old Testament foreshadows the sinless life of Christ, who offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the sacrificial system outlined in Numbers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were given these laws to follow as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites were to bring their offerings and sacrifices, serving as the dwelling place of God among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron who were responsible for performing the sacrifices and maintaining the rituals as prescribed by God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_system.htm">Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The system of offerings and sacrifices instituted by God for the Israelites, which included burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_purity.htm">The Importance of Purity</a></b><br>The requirement for offerings to be "without blemish" underscores the importance of purity and holiness in our worship and service to God.

Paul borrows the image in <a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>, &#8220;I am being poured out like a drink offering,&#8221; indicating a life gladly expended for God.<p>&#8226; Drink offerings, consisting of joy-producing wine (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>), underscore that obedience is meant to be glad, not grim. <a href="/joel/1-9.htm">Joel 1:9</a> warns that when &#8220;grain and drink offerings are withheld,&#8221; joy dries up&#8212;an implicit call to keep the libation flowing in worship today as well.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In addition to the regular burnt offering and its grain offering</b><p>&#8226; The Feast of Weeks offerings in <a href="/bsb/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a> never replace the daily rhythm of worship. <a href="/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3&#8211;4</a> outlines that rhythm: &#8220;two unblemished year-old male lambs each day, offered morning and evening&#8221;.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word stresses &#8220;in addition,&#8221; showing that special celebrations build on, rather than cancel, steady faithfulness. The same pattern appears in <a href="/leviticus/23-18.htm">Leviticus 23:18</a>, where festival animals are presented &#8220;together with their grain offerings and drink offerings.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Our own spiritual disciplines mirror this layering principle: special retreats, conferences, or outreach efforts add richness, but they cannot substitute for the regular &#8220;morning and evening&#8221; walk with the Lord (compare <a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>&#8212;&#8220;take up his cross daily&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The combined scent of regular and additional sacrifices rises as &#8220;a pleasing aroma to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/23-18.htm">Leviticus 23:18</a>). Likewise, <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> urges believers to present their lives as an ongoing, pleasing sacrifice, then build every extra act of service on that foundation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The animals must be unblemished</b><p>&#8226; Perfection is non-negotiable: &#8220;You must not present anything with a defect, because it will not be accepted on your behalf&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/22-20.htm">Leviticus 22:20</a>). Even a festive atmosphere cannot excuse cutting corners.<p>&#8226; <a href="/malachi/1-13.htm">Malachi 1:13</a> rebukes those who offer the lame and sick; God still expects excellence, not leftovers.<p>&#8226; The requirement ultimately points to Christ: &#8220;with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or spot&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a> adds that He &#8220;offered Himself unblemished to God.&#8221; Every flawless animal in <a href="/bsb/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a> foreshadows the flawless Savior.<p>&#8226; For believers, the call to be &#8220;blameless and pure&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>) flows from being united to that perfect Lamb. In practice, this means examining motives, confessing sin quickly, and seeking integrity in every offering of time, talent, or treasure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/28-31.htm">Numbers 28:31</a> weaves three strands&#8212;drink offering, continual offering, flawless offering&#8212;into a single cord of wholehearted worship. God invites His people to pour out joy alongside obedience, to add extra devotion without neglecting daily faithfulness, and to pursue excellence that reflects the spotless Lamb. Living this way today turns every ordinary moment and every special occasion into a fragrant, God-honoring sacrifice.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/28-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Offer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">them with their drink offerings</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;nis&#183;k&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
