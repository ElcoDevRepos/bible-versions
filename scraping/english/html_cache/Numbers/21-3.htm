In the context of <a href="/numbers/21.htm">Numbers 21</a>, the Israelites were facing opposition from the Canaanites. The plea indicates a moment of desperation and reliance on divine intervention. This reflects a recurring theme in the Old Testament where God responds to the cries of His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a> when God heard the groaning of the Israelites in Egypt.<p><b>and delivered up the Canaanites.</b><br>The deliverance of the Canaanites into Israel's hands signifies God's sovereignty and His role as a divine warrior on behalf of Israel. This act of deliverance is consistent with God's promise to give the land of Canaan to the descendants of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). It also foreshadows the eventual conquest of Canaan under Joshua, where God continues to deliver enemies into Israel's hands (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>).<p><b>Israel devoted them and their cities to destruction;</b><br>The term "devoted to destruction" (Hebrew: herem) indicates a complete consecration to God, often through destruction. This was a common practice in ancient warfare, especially in the context of holy war, where the spoils and people were dedicated to God, leaving nothing for personal gain. This act was meant to purify the land from idolatry and sin, aligning with <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2-5</a>, where God commands the Israelites to destroy the nations in Canaan to prevent idolatry.<p><b>so they named the place Hormah.</b><br>Hormah means "destruction" or "devotion to destruction," and the naming of the place serves as a memorial of God's victory and judgment. This location is significant in Israel's history, as it was previously mentioned in <a href="/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>, where the Israelites were defeated by the Amalekites and Canaanites.

(See <a href="/joshua/12-14.htm" title="The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;">Joshua 12:14</a>; <a href="/judges/1-17.htm" title="And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.">Judges 1:17</a>.) If the attack of the Canaanites was made at the time of the final departure from Kadesh, the latter view must be maintained, as it can scarcely be supposed that the cities could have been rebuilt and again destroyed in so short an interval.<p><span class= "bld">And he called the name of the place Hormah.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And the name of the place was called Hormah. </span>The word <span class= "ital">Hormah</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., a devoted thing</span>--is cognate with the verb which occurs in this and the preceding verse, and which is rendered <span class= "ital">utterly destroy. </span>The place is so called by anticipation in <a href="/numbers/14-45.htm" title="Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelled in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even to Hormah.">Numbers 14:45</a>, and, as in regard to other names (<span class= "ital">e.g., Bethel </span>and <span class= "ital">Jacob</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>the name was probably given anew to the place on a later occasion (<a href="/judges/1-17.htm" title="And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.

No doubt the banning implies here their utter destruction, because it is not the vow before the battle, but the carrying of it out after the victory, which is here spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">And he called the name of the place Hormah.</span> Rather, "the name of the place was called (impersonal use of the transitive) Charmah." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. It is not very clear what place received this name at this time. It does not appear to have been Arid itself, as would have seemed most natural, because Arid and Hormah are mentioned side by side in <a href="/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>. It is identified with Zephath in <a href="/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>. It may have been the place where the victory was won which gave all the cities of Arid to destruction. Whether it was the Hormah mentioned in chapter Numbers 14:45 is very doubtful (see note there). The nomenclature of the Jews, especially as to places, and most especially as to places with which their own connection was passing or broken, was vague and confused in the extreme, and nothing can be more unsatisfactory than arguments which turn upon the shifting names of places long ago perished and forgotten. It must be added that the three verses which narrate the chastisement of this Canaanite chieftain have caused immense embarrassment to commentators. If the incident is narrated in its proper order of time, it must have happened during the stay of the Israelites under Mount Hor, when they had finally left the neighbourhood of the Negeb, and were separated from the king of Arid by many days' march, and by a most impracticable country. It is therefore generally supposed that the narrative is out of place, and that it really belongs to the time when Israel was gathered together for the second time at Kadesh, and When his reappearance there in force might well have given rise to the report that be was about to invade Canaan from that side. This is unsatisfactory, because no plausible reason can be assigned for the insertion of the notice where it stands, both here and in <a href="/numbers/33-40.htm">Numbers 33:40</a>. To say that Moses wished to bring it into juxtaposition with the victories recorded in the latter part of the chapter, from which it is separated by the incident of the fiery serpents, and the brief record of many journeys, is to confess that no explanation can be invented which has the least show of reason. If the narrative be displaced, the displacement must simply be due to accident or interpolation. Again, it would seem quite inconsistent with the position and plans of Israel since the rebellion of Kadesh that any invasion and conquest, even temporary, of any part of Canaan should be made at this time, and that especially if the attack was not made until Israel was lying in the Arabah on his way round the land of Edom. It is therefore supposed by some that the vow only was made at this time, and the ban suspended over the place, and that it was only carried out as part of the general conquest under Joshua; that, in fact, the fulfillment of the vow is narrated in <a href="/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>; <a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16, 17</a>. This, however, throws the narrative as it stands into confusion and discredit, for the ban and the destruction become a mockery and an unreality if nothing more was done to the towns of the king of Arad than was done at the same time to the towns of all his neighbours. It would be more reverent to reject the story as an error or a falsehood than to empty it of the meaning which it was obviously intended to convey. We are certainly meant to understand that the vow was there and then accepted by God, and was there and then carried into effect by Israel; the towns of Arad were depopulated and destroyed as far as lay in their power, although they may have been immediately reoccupied. There are only two theories which are worth considering. 1. The narrative <span class="accented">may</span> really be displaced, for what cause we do not know. If so, it would <span class="accented">he</span> more satisfactory to refer it, not to the time of the second encampment at Kadesh, but to the time of the first, during the absence of the spies in Canaan. It is probable that their entry was known, as was the case with Joshua's spies (<a href="/joshua/2-2.htm">Joshua 2:2</a>); and nothing could be more likely than that the king of Arad, suspecting what would follow, should attempt to anticipate invasion by attack. If it were so it might help to account for the rash confidence shown by the people afterwards (<a href="/numbers/14-40.htm">Numbers 14:40</a>), for the mention of Hormah (<a href="/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>), and for the reappearance of kings of Hormah and of Arad in the days of <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>. The narrative <span class="accented">may</span> after all be in place. That the Israelites lay for thirty days under Mount Hor is certain, and they may have been longer. During this period they could not get pasture for their cattle on the side of Edom, and they may have wandered far and wide in search of it. It may have been but a comparatively small band which approached the Negeb near enough to be attacked, and which, by the help of God, was enabled to defeat the king of Arad, and to lay waste his towns. It had certainly been no great feat for all Israel to overthrow a border chieftain who could not possibly have brought 5000 men into the field.
