This reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society, where men held significant authority over family matters. The ability to nullify vows underscores the importance of family unity and the husband's role as the spiritual leader. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>, where the husband is described as the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. The timing of "after he hears of them" indicates the responsibility to act promptly and decisively, reflecting the importance of communication and accountability within the family unit.<p><b>then he will bear her iniquity.</b><br>This phrase highlights the transfer of responsibility from the woman to the man if he chooses to nullify her vow. In the cultural and religious context of ancient Israel, vows were serious commitments made before God, and breaking them was considered sinful. By annulling the vow, the husband assumes the spiritual and moral responsibility for the decision, symbolizing a protective and sacrificial role. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who bears the iniquities of believers, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, where it states that the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all. This reflects the redemptive work of Christ, who takes upon Himself the sins of humanity, offering forgiveness and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received and communicated God's laws, including those concerning vows.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws were given, living in the wilderness during their journey to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/husband.htm">Husband</a></b><br>The man who has the authority to nullify his wife's vows according to the law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wife.htm">Wife</a></b><br>The woman whose vows or pledges can be nullified by her husband.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vows.htm">Vows</a></b><br>Promises or commitments made to God, which were taken very seriously in Israelite society.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_and_responsibility.htm">Authority and Responsibility</a></b><br>The passage highlights the husband's authority and responsibility in the family.

Earlier verses show that a man must speak up &#8220;on the day he hears&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/30-7.htm">Numbers 30:7, 12</a>). Silence equals agreement.<p>&#8226; If he waits, the woman assumes her vow stands and may already be performing it; reversing course later creates moral confusion.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly warns against delaying right action (<a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27-28</a>; <a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>).
