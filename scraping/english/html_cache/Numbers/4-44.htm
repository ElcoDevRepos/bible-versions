The registration by clans indicates the importance of family lineage and tribal affiliation in Israelite society. This census was part of a larger organizational structure established by God for the service of the Tabernacle, ensuring that each clan had specific duties. The Levites were set apart for religious duties, emphasizing the theme of holiness and separation for God's service. This registration is reminiscent of other biblical censuses, such as those in the books of Chronicles, which also emphasize the importance of order and preparation in worship.<p><b>numbered 3,200</b><br>The specific number of 3,200 indicates the total count of Kohathite men eligible for service, aged between thirty and fifty, as outlined earlier in the chapter. This precise number underscores the meticulous nature of the census and the importance of each individual's role in the community. The number reflects the strength and capacity of the Kohathites to fulfill their duties in transporting the most sacred objects of the Tabernacle. This attention to detail in numbering is consistent with other biblical accounts, such as the numbering of the Israelites in the wilderness, which highlights God's concern for order and accountability. The number also signifies the readiness and preparedness of God's people to carry out His commands, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gershonites.htm">The Gershonites</a></b><br>One of the Levitical families responsible for the care of the tabernacle's curtains, coverings, and other fabric elements.
