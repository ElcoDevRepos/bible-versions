The Israelites sought permission to travel through Edomite territory peacefully. This reflects the broader biblical theme of seeking peace and cooperation with neighboring nations. Historically, Edom was descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, which adds a familial dimension to the request. The Israelites' appeal highlights the importance of diplomacy and respect for national boundaries.<p><b>We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard,</b><br>The Israelites assured the Edomites that they would not disrupt their agriculture. Fields and vineyards were vital for sustenance and economic stability in ancient times. This promise indicates a respect for property and resources, aligning with the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor and not coveting or taking what belongs to others. It also reflects the Israelites' reliance on God's provision rather than taking from others.<p><b>or drink water from any well.</b><br>Water was a precious resource in the arid regions of the Near East. By promising not to drink from the wells, the Israelites demonstrated their intention to avoid imposing on the Edomites' resources. This assurance underscores the importance of self-sufficiency and respect for others' needs. It also reflects the Israelites' trust in God's provision, as He had previously provided water miraculously during their desert wanderings.<p><b>We will stay on the King&#8217;s Highway</b><br>The King's Highway was an ancient trade route that ran from Egypt through the Sinai Peninsula to the northern regions of the Near East. It was a well-established path used for commerce and travel. By committing to stay on this road, the Israelites indicated their intention to pass through quickly and without deviation, minimizing their impact on the land. This route's historical significance highlights the interconnectedness of ancient civilizations and the importance of established pathways for communication and trade.<p><b>until we have passed through your territory.</b><br>The Israelites' request to pass through Edom was temporary, emphasizing their desire for a peaceful and transient passage. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land, a journey marked by faith and reliance on God's guidance. The request also underscores the transient nature of their wilderness wanderings, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to give them a land of their own.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Moses, who are journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_sihon_of_the_amorites.htm">King Sihon of the Amorites</a></b><br>The ruler of the Amorites, whose land the Israelites request to pass through.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king's_highway.htm">The King's Highway</a></b><br>An ancient trade route that the Israelites wish to use to pass through the Amorite territory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who sends messengers to King Sihon with the request.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorite_territory.htm">Amorite Territory</a></b><br>The land controlled by King Sihon, which the Israelites seek to traverse peacefully.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_others'_property.htm">Respect for Others' Property</a></b><br>The Israelites' request demonstrates a respect for the sovereignty and property of others, even when they have the power to take by force.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/peaceful_intentions.htm">Peaceful Intentions</a></b><br>The emphasis on not turning aside into fields or vineyards and not drinking from wells shows a commitment to peace and integrity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>Despite the refusal, the Israelites' journey continues, reminding us to trust in God's overarching plan even when faced with obstacles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/handling_rejection.htm">Handling Rejection</a></b><br>The Israelites' experience teaches us how to handle rejection with grace and to seek God's guidance in the face of closed doors.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The eventual outcome, where God delivers the Amorites into Israel's hands, underscores His control over nations and events.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_21_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 21:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Num_21_22_show_Israel_s_peace.htm">How does Numbers 21:22 demonstrate Israel's desire for peaceful passage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_diplomacy_from_Numbers_21_22.htm">What can we learn about diplomacy from Israel's request in Numbers 21:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Numbers_21_22_to_Matthew_5_9_peace.htm">How does Numbers 21:22 connect with Jesus' teachings on peace in Matthew 5:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Approach_conflicts_like_Israel_in_Num_21_22.htm">How should Christians today approach conflicts, inspired by Israel's example in Numbers 21:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_humility_aid_peace_in_Num_21_22.htm">What role does humility play in seeking peaceful resolutions, as seen in Numbers 21:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Israel_seek_passage_in_Num_21_22.htm">Why did Israel request passage through the land in Numbers 21:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Num_21_22_show_God_s_guidance.htm">How does Numbers 21:22 reflect God's guidance for Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Numbers_21_22_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events in Numbers 21:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_numbers_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Numbers 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/evidence_for_ephraim's_claims.htm">1 Chronicles 7:20-29 -
