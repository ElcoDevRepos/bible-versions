The term "oracle" indicates a divine message, often associated with prophecy. Balaam's role as a prophet is complex, as he is both a seer and a diviner, which is evident in his interactions with Balak and God. This moment marks the beginning of a series of prophecies that Balaam will deliver, which are significant in the narrative of Israel's journey to the Promised Land.<p><b>Balak brought me from Aram,</b><br>Aram refers to a region in Mesopotamia, often associated with the area around the Euphrates River. This geographical reference highlights the distance Balak was willing to go to secure Balaam's services, indicating the seriousness of his intent to curse Israel. Aram is historically significant as the homeland of the patriarchs, such as Abraham, which adds a layer of irony to Balak's request, as he seeks to curse the descendants of those who once lived in Aram.<p><b>the king of Moab from the mountains of the east.</b><br>Balak, the king of Moab, represents a nation historically connected to Lot, Abraham's nephew. The "mountains of the east" likely refer to the highlands east of the Jordan River, a region known for its strategic and defensive advantages. Moab's fear of Israel is rooted in their recent victories over other nations, and Balak's actions reflect the political and military tensions of the time.<p><b>&#8216;Come,&#8217; he said, &#8216;put a curse on Jacob for me;</b><br>The request to curse "Jacob" is a direct reference to the nation of Israel, descended from Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel. Cursing in the ancient Near Eastern context was believed to have real power, and Balak's desire to curse Israel reflects his desperation to weaken them. This request is significant in light of God's covenant with Abraham, which included promises of blessing and protection for his descendants.<p><b>come and denounce Israel!&#8217;</b><br>To "denounce" Israel implies a formal declaration against them, seeking to invoke divine disfavor. This reflects the belief in the power of spoken words and blessings or curses in the ancient world. The request to denounce Israel is ultimately futile, as God's covenant promises to Israel ensure their protection and blessing. This moment foreshadows the ultimate failure of Balak's plans and highlights the theme of God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet known for his ability to bless and curse.

Despite distance, expense, and royal pressure, Balaam can speak only what God allows. The verse spotlights three truths: human schemes cannot override divine promises, Israel&#8217;s identity as Jacob anchors them in covenant favor, and God can use unlikely voices to broadcast His irreversible blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Took up his parable.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> (cf. <a href="/numbers/21-27.htm">Numbers 21:27</a>).
