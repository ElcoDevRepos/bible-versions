The goat symbolizes the removal of sin and impurity from the community. This practice is rooted in the Levitical laws, where the goat is often used for atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-15.htm">Leviticus 16:15-16</a>). The sin offering underscores the need for purification and reconciliation with God. In the broader biblical narrative, the concept of a sin offering points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>in addition to the regular burnt offering</b><br>The regular burnt offering was a daily ritual, signifying the people's continual dedication and commitment to God. It was a holistic offering, with the entire animal consumed by fire, symbolizing total surrender to God's will. This regular offering served as a constant reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The addition of the sin offering to the regular burnt offering highlights the comprehensive nature of worship, which includes both dedication and atonement.<p><b>with its grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, often made of fine flour mixed with oil and frankincense, accompanied the burnt offering. It represented the fruits of human labor and was an expression of gratitude and dependence on God for provision. The grain offering also symbolized the sanctification of daily life and work, acknowledging that all sustenance comes from God. This offering can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching of offering one's life as a living sacrifice (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>and drink offering</b><br>The drink offering, typically wine, was poured out at the altar, symbolizing the pouring out of one's life in service to God. It complemented the burnt and grain offerings, completing the sacrificial ritual. The drink offering signifies joy and fellowship with God, as wine is often associated with celebration and covenantal blessings in Scripture. In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul uses the imagery of a drink offering to describe his own life poured out in service to Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>), further connecting the Old Testament sacrificial practices to the life of a believer in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the details of the offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were given these specific instructions for worship and offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where these offerings were to be made, serving as the dwelling place of God among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_tabernacles.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>The context of this verse, which is part of the instructions for the offerings during this important festival.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The individuals responsible for carrying out the offerings as prescribed by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_purpose_of_offerings.htm">Understanding the Purpose of Offerings</a></b><br>The offerings were a means for the Israelites to express their devotion and obedience to God.

The single male goat reminds us of substitution: one life for many (<a href="/leviticus/16-15.htm">Leviticus 16:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; This daily reminder foreshadowed the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ, who &#8220;appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of Himself&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26-28</a>).<p>&#8226; By specifying a goat, God tied the Feast of Tabernacles sacrifices to earlier Day of Atonement imagery, reaffirming that fellowship with Him comes only through shed blood (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in addition to the regular burnt offering</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;in addition to the regular burnt offering&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226;

shows that special festival worship never replaced daily devotion; it built on it.<p>&#8226; Burnt offerings were consumed entirely on the altar, symbolizing total consecration (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> echoes this pattern: believers are urged to present their bodies &#8220;as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God.&#8221; Our consistent, ordinary obedience is foundational;

The drink offering&#8212;wine poured out beside the altar (<a href="/numbers/15-4.htm">Numbers 15:4-10</a>)&#8212;expressed joy and gratitude; Paul later alludes to it when he says, &#8220;I am already being poured out like a drink offering&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Together these non-animal gifts teach that worship involves more than dealing with sin; it also includes thankful celebration of God&#8217;s ongoing provision (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Placed alongside the burnt and sin offerings, they present a balanced picture: atonement, dedication, and thanksgiving all belong in true worship (<a href="/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/29-34.htm">Numbers 29:34</a> adds a single male goat for sin, atop the daily burnt, grain, and drink offerings, during the Feast of Tabernacles. The verse underscores three truths: sin must be atoned for, daily consecration must never lapse, and heartfelt gratitude must accompany every act of worship. All three find their fulfillment and permanence in Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice covers sin, whose lordship claims our whole lives, and whose grace fills us with thankful joy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/29-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Include one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1425;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">male goat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#347;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
