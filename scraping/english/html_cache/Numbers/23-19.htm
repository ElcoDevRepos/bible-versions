In biblical context, humans are often depicted as prone to deceit and sin (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). God's nature is inherently truthful and faithful (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>). This distinction is crucial in understanding the reliability of God's promises, as seen in the covenant with Abraham (Genesis 15).<p><b>or a son of man, that He should change His mind</b><br>The term "son of man" is used to denote humanity, emphasizing human limitations and changeability. In contrast, God's immutability is highlighted here (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). This phrase reassures believers of God's steadfastness, as seen in His unchanging nature throughout the Old Testament, such as His consistent deliverance of Israel (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>).<p><b>Does He speak and not act?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores God's faithfulness in action. When God speaks, His words are powerful and effective (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). Historical examples include the fulfillment of prophecies, such as the deliverance from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-41.htm">Exodus 12:41</a>) and the coming of the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, <a href="/matthew/1-22.htm">Matthew 1:22-23</a>).<p><b>Does He promise and not fulfill?</b><br>This phrase assures the fulfillment of God's promises, a central theme in Scripture. The Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and its fulfillment in the nation of Israel and ultimately in Jesus Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>) serve as key examples.

This provides believers with a foundation of trust and security in His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_faithfulness.htm">Divine Faithfulness</a></b><br>God&#8217;s promises are sure and steadfast.

He is eternal, infinite, perfectly holy (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9</a>: &#8220;I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like Me&#8221;).<p>- Human nature is limited and fallible; God&#8217;s nature is unlimited and flawless. Knowing this distinction guards us from projecting human weakness onto Him (<a href="/psalms/50-21.htm">Psalm 50:21</a>).<p>- Because God is not a creature, His character sets the standard for all truth and righteousness (<a href="/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that He should lie</b><p>- Lying springs from sin and limitation, neither of which exists in God. Scripture is unequivocal: &#8220;it is impossible for God to lie&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>) and &#8220;God, who cannot lie&#8221; (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>).<p>- Every word in Scripture is entirely dependable; no hidden agenda, no half-truth (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>).<p>- In practical terms, when we read a promise or warning in the Bible, we may bank on it without reservation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or a son of man, that He should change His mind</b><p>- People can be fickle, but God&#8217;s purposes never wobble. &#8220;I the LORD do not change&#8221; (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>) and &#8220;He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change His mind&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-29.htm">1 Samuel 15:29</a>).<p>- His immutability steadies our faith: the same righteousness that judged sin at the Cross still forgives repentant sinners today (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>- When circumstances shift, God&#8217;s unchanging character anchors believers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Does He speak and not act?</b><p>- God&#8217;s utterance is always effective. &#8220;So My word that goes out from My mouth will not return to Me empty&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>- From creation (&#8220;For He spoke, and it came to be,&#8221; <a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>) to final judgment, His declarations shape reality.<p>- This means every prophetic word&#8212;whether already fulfilled in Christ&#8217;s first coming or awaiting His return&#8212;carries absolute certainty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Does He promise and not fulfill?</b><p>- History testifies that every divine promise stands. Joshua could say, &#8220;Not one of all the good promises the LORD had made to the house of Israel failed; everything was fulfilled&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a>).<p>- The ultimate confirmation is Christ: &#8220;For all the promises of God are &#8216;Yes&#8217; in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p>- Because God&#8217;s track record is flawless, believers may trust future promises&#8212;resurrection, eternal life, His abiding presence&#8212;with unwavering confidence (<a href="/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a> slices through human doubt by presenting a four-fold assurance: God is unlike us, He never lies, He never wavers, and He always backs His word with action. When He speaks, reality bends; when He promises, fulfillment is inevitable. Therefore, our response is simple&#8212;take Him at His word, rest in His unchanging character, and live in glad expectation of every promise still to come.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Neither the son of man, that he should repent.--</span>The adoption of these words, with slight variation, by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/15-29.htm" title="And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.">1Samuel 15:29</a>) affords evidence of his familiarity with this portion of the Pentateuch.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/23-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_410.htm">Strong's 410: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength -- as adjective, mighty, the Almighty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that He should lie,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1499;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#238;&#183;&#7733;az&#183;z&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
