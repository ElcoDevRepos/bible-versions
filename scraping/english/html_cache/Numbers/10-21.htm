Their specific role was to carry the most sacred objects of the tabernacle. This task was assigned to them by divine command, emphasizing the importance of their duty. The Kohathites' journey reflects the organized and orderly movement of the Israelites, as directed by God. This phrase highlights the obedience and responsibility of the Kohathites in fulfilling their God-given role.<p><b>transporting the holy objects</b><br>The holy objects included the Ark of the Covenant, the table of showbread, the lampstand, the altars, and other sacred items used in worship. These items were considered extremely sacred, and only the Kohathites were permitted to carry them, but they were not allowed to touch them directly. The items were covered by Aaron and his sons before the Kohathites transported them. This underscores the holiness of God and the reverence required in handling sacred objects. The transportation of these items symbolizes the presence of God moving with His people.<p><b>the tabernacle was to be set up before their arrival</b><br>The tabernacle, a portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, was to be erected before the Kohathites arrived with the holy objects. This ensured that the sacred items had a proper place upon arrival, maintaining the sanctity and order of worship. The setting up of the tabernacle before the arrival of the holy objects signifies preparation and readiness to receive God's presence. It also reflects the meticulous care and reverence required in worship, as well as the importance of having a designated place for God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kohathites.htm">Kohathites</a></b><br>A Levitical clan responsible for carrying the most sacred objects of the tabernacle, such as the Ark of the Covenant, the table, the lampstand, and the altars.

After the cloud lifted (<a href="/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11-13</a>), each clan knew its turn.<p>&#8211; The clan of Kohath, descended from Levi, carried unique responsibility. Earlier God told Moses, &#8220;Appoint Kohath&#8230; to carry the most holy things&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4-15</a>).<p>&#8211; Their departure right after the Gershonites and Merarites (who hauled the tent curtains and boards, <a href="/numbers/10-17.htm">Numbers 10:17</a>) created a rhythm of reverence and efficiency.<p>&#8211; Cross references: Joshua&#8217;s careful procession with the ark across Jordan (<a href="/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3-6</a>); David&#8217;s later attempt to move the ark, learning the need for God-given order (<a href="/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Transporting the holy objects</b><p>&#8211; The holy objects were the ark, table of presence bread, menorah, altars, and utensils (<a href="/numbers/4-5.htm">Numbers 4:5-14</a>).<p>&#8211; Only after Aaron and his sons covered each item did the Kohathites pick them up, ensuring no one touched the sacred articles directly (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>; compare <a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>).<p>&#8211; This practice underscores:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s holiness is uncompromising.<p>&#8226; Service roles differ yet complement one another (cf. <a href="/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience safeguards life and worship; failure to follow instructions brought death to Uzzah (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The tabernacle was to be set up before their arrival</b><p>&#8211; Gershon and Merari left earlier so curtains, frames, and courtyard could be re-erected first (<a href="/numbers/10-17.htm">Numbers 10:17, 21</a>).<p>&#8211; By the time Kohath arrived, the structure stood ready to receive the sacred vessels. This prevented the holy objects from resting on bare ground and kept them from casual view (<a href="/exodus/40-2.htm">Exodus 40:2-8</a>).<p>&#8211; Spiritual parallels:<p>&#8226; God prepares environments before unveiling deeper realities (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Ministry timing matters; Paul waited three years before visiting Jerusalem (<a href="/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Order produces peace, not confusion (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33, 40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/10-21.htm">Numbers 10:21</a> highlights God&#8217;s orderly plan: the Kohathites moved only after the structural pieces preceded them, ensuring the holiest objects entered a prepared sanctuary.
