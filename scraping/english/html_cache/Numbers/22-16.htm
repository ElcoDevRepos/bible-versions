Balaam's reputation as a seer was well-known, and Balak sought his services to curse the Israelites. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of seeking divine intervention through prophets or seers. The act of sending messengers indicates the seriousness of Balak's request and the importance of Balaam's role in the unfolding events.<p><b>&#8220;This is what Balak son of Zippor says:</b><br>Balak, the king of Moab, is identified here as the son of Zippor, which helps to historically situate him within the Moabite lineage. The Moabites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, and often had contentious relations with Israel. Balak's fear of the Israelites, who were encamped on the plains of Moab, prompted him to seek supernatural means to protect his kingdom. This reflects the political and military tensions of the time, as well as the belief in the power of spoken curses and blessings.<p><b>&#8216;Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me,</b><br>Balak's plea underscores the urgency and desperation of his request. He is willing to overcome any obstacles to secure Balaam's presence, indicating the high stakes involved. This reflects the belief in the efficacy of curses and blessings in the ancient world, where words were seen as powerful tools that could influence events and outcomes. The phrase also highlights the theme of divine sovereignty, as ultimately, it is God who controls the outcome, despite human intentions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner known for his ability to bless or curse.

By sending them again, the Moabite king raises the stakes, showing how urgently he wants supernatural assistance against Israel. The text underscores several truths:<p>&#8226; Human rulers often seek spiritual power when worldly resources feel inadequate (cf. <a href="/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Repeated appeals reveal a heart unwilling to accept God&#8217;s first answer (<a href="/numbers/22-12.htm">Numbers 22:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The messengers&#8217; obedience to Balak contrasts with Balaam&#8217;s wavering obedience to God (compare <a href="/matthew/8-9.htm">Matthew 8:9</a>).<p>Their arrival sets up a clash between earthly authority and divine authority that will dominate the chapter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is what Balak son of Zippor says</b><p>By naming himself, Balak claims royal weight, as though his title should sway Balaam. Scripture records similar introductions&#8212;&#8220;Thus says Pharaoh&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/5-10.htm">Exodus 5:10</a>) or &#8220;Thus says Sennacherib&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-10.htm">2 Chronicles 32:10</a>)&#8212;each time highlighting a human voice that ultimately bows to God&#8217;s word (<a href="/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24</a>).<p>Key observations:<p>&#8226; Balak&#8217;s self-identification reminds us that God knows every earthly king by name and limits their reach (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;Balak son of Zippor&#8221; fixes the event in real history, reinforcing the literal accuracy of Numbers.<p>&#8226; While Balak speaks through envoys, God will soon speak through Balaam&#8217;s own donkey (<a href="/numbers/22-28.htm">Numbers 22:28&#8211;30</a>), proving the Lord&#8217;s unmatched sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me</b><p>Balak pleads for immediate compliance, revealing desperation:<p>&#8226; He fears Israel&#8217;s military advance (<a href="/numbers/22-3.htm">Numbers 22:3&#8211;6</a>) and hopes a curse can reverse God&#8217;s blessing (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p>&#8226; His words expose the blindness of sin; the true hindrance is not logistical but moral&#8212;God has said &#8220;You shall not go with them&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/22-12.htm">Numbers 22:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Balak&#8217;s insistence pictures all attempts to bypass divine boundaries (cf. <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>; <a href="/acts/5-39.htm">Acts 5:39</a>).<p>For Balaam, the invitation tests loyalty.

The verse highlights human persistence against divine restraint, contrasts earthly authority with heavenly authority, and prepares us to see God overrule every scheme.
