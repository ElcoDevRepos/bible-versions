Asher's name means "happy" or "blessed," reflecting Leah's joy at his birth (<a href="/genesis/30-13.htm">Genesis 30:13</a>). Geographically, the tribe of Asher was allotted a fertile region in the northern part of Canaan, along the Mediterranean coast, known for its olive oil production (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24</a>). This tribe's location and resources were significant for trade and agriculture. In the context of <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, Asher's inclusion in the reconnaissance mission to Canaan highlights the unity and collective responsibility of all tribes in the conquest of the Promised Land.<p><b>Sethur son of Michael</b><br>Sethur, whose name means "hidden" or "mystery," was chosen as the representative from the tribe of Asher to spy out the land of Canaan. His father's name, Michael, means "Who is like God?" which is a common name in the Hebrew Bible, reflecting a rhetorical question that emphasizes God's uniqueness and supremacy. The selection of Sethur indicates the importance of each tribe having a voice in the exploration and subsequent report on the land. Although not much is known about Sethur beyond this passage, his role was crucial in the collective assessment of Canaan, which ultimately influenced the Israelites' actions and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sethur.htm">Sethur</a></b><br>A leader from the tribe of Asher, chosen to spy out the land of Canaan.
