It is characterized by its arid climate and sparse vegetation. In biblical times, the Negev was a significant area for the Israelites as they journeyed from Egypt to the Promised Land. The Negev served as a testing ground for the Israelites' faith and obedience to God. The journey through the Negev symbolizes the trials and challenges faced by believers in their spiritual journey.<p><b>and came to Hebron</b><br>Hebron is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a rich biblical history. It is located in the Judean hills and is significant as the place where Abraham settled and where the patriarchs and matriarchs are buried. Hebron was a key city in the conquest of Canaan and later became King David's first capital. The city's name means "association" or "friendship," reflecting its role as a place of covenant and fellowship with God.<p><b>where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, dwelled</b><br>These individuals are described as descendants of Anak, a race of giants known as the Anakim. The presence of these formidable inhabitants in Hebron posed a significant challenge to the Israelites. The Anakim were feared for their size and strength, symbolizing the daunting obstacles believers may face. The mention of these giants highlights the need for faith and reliance on God's power to overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges.<p><b>It had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt</b><br>Zoan, also known as Tanis, was an ancient city in the Nile Delta of Egypt. The reference to Hebron being built seven years before Zoan emphasizes the antiquity and significance of Hebron. This comparison underscores Hebron's importance in the biblical narrative and its role as a longstanding center of faith and heritage. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, suggesting Hebron's established and enduring place in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/negev.htm">Negev</a></b><br>A desert region in southern Israel, representing the initial area the Israelite spies explored.

These three chiefs of the Beni-Anak are said to have been expelled from Hebron fifty years later by Caleb (<a href="/joshua/15-14.htm">Joshua 15:14</a>; <a href="/judges/1-20.htm">Judges 1:20</a>). The gigantic size which the Anakim shared with the Emim and Rephaim, other remnants of the aboriginal inhabitants, may have been accompanied by remarkable longevity; or they may have been quite young at the time of this visit; or, finally, they may not have been individuals at all, but families or clans. <span class="cmt_word">Now Hebron was built seven years before Zean in Egypt.</span> Hebron was in existence at the time of Abraham. Zoan was Tanis, near the mouth of the eastern branch of the Nile (see on Psalm 78:12, 43). If it be true that the Pharaoh of the exodus had his royal residence at Zoan, Moses may have had access to the archives of the city, or he may have learnt the date of its foundation from the priests who gave him his Egyptian education. That there was any real connection between the two places is extremely problematical, nor is it possible to give any reason for the abrupt insertion here of a fragment of history so minute and in itself so unimportant. There is, however, no one but Moses to whom the statement can with any sort of likelihood be traced; a later writer could have had no authority for making the statement, and no possible reason for inventing it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/13-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They went up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
