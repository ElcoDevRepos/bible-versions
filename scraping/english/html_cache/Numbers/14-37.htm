These men, except for Joshua and Caleb, focused on the formidable inhabitants and fortified cities, instilling fear and doubt among the Israelites. This act of disbelief and rebellion against God's promise is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, demonstrating a lack of faith and trust in God's power and plan. Theologically, this serves as a warning against the consequences of unbelief and disobedience. The spies' report contrasts with the faith-filled perspective of Joshua and Caleb, who trusted in God's ability to deliver the land to them.<p><b>were struck down by a plague before the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "struck down by a plague" indicates a direct and immediate divine judgment. In the Old Testament, plagues are often used as instruments of God's wrath and correction (e.g., <a href="/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7-12</a>, the plagues of Egypt). This particular judgment underscores the seriousness of their sin and the holiness of God, who cannot tolerate rebellion and disbelief. The phrase "before the LORD" emphasizes that this act of judgment was not random but was executed in the presence of God, highlighting His sovereignty and justice. This event serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of leading others into sin and the importance of faithfulness to God's commands. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and separation from God for those who reject His promises, pointing to the need for redemption through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>Twelve men were sent by Moses to scout the Promised Land.
