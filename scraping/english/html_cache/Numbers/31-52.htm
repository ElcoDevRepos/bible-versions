The commanders, representing the military leadership, are acknowledging God's role in their victory by offering a portion of the plunder. This act of giving is a form of worship and gratitude, recognizing God's sovereignty and provision. The concept of offering the first fruits or a portion of one's gain to God is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a> and <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>. It underscores the principle of stewardship and the acknowledgment that all blessings come from God.<p><b>weighed 16,750 shekels</b><br>The specific weight of the gold, 16,750 shekels, indicates the substantial amount of wealth acquired and dedicated to God. A shekel was a unit of weight used in ancient Israel, approximately 11 grams or 0.4 ounces. This detail not only provides historical context but also emphasizes the magnitude of the offering. The precision in recording the weight reflects the importance of accountability and integrity in handling resources dedicated to God. This practice of careful record-keeping is seen in other parts of Scripture, such as in the construction of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24-31</a>). The offering of gold can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the ultimate offering and sacrifice for humanity's sins, fulfilling the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
