The Hebrew word for "unintentionally" implies actions done in ignorance or without deliberate intent. This reflects the understanding that not all sins are committed willfully, and there is a provision for those who err unknowingly. The idea of unintentional sin is also seen in <a href="/leviticus/4.htm">Leviticus 4</a>, where offerings are prescribed for such transgressions, highlighting God's grace and the importance of maintaining purity within the community.<p><b>and do not obey all these commandments</b><br>The commandments refer to the laws given by God to the Israelites through Moses. These laws encompass moral, ceremonial, and civil aspects of life, aiming to set Israel apart as a holy nation. The emphasis on "all these commandments" underscores the comprehensive nature of the law and the expectation of complete obedience. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience is a response to God's deliverance and blessings.<p><b>that the LORD has spoken to Moses&#8212;</b><br>This phrase establishes the divine origin of the commandments, affirming that they are not merely human constructs but are given by God Himself. Moses serves as the mediator between God and the people, a role that prefigures Christ as the ultimate mediator of the New Covenant. The authority of the commandments is rooted in their divine source, and Moses' role as a prophet and leader is central to the transmission of God's will to the Israelites. This connection between God, Moses, and the law is foundational to understanding the covenantal relationship in the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, through whom God communicated His laws and commandments.

Moses has just relayed laws about offerings (<a href="/numbers/15-17.htm">Numbers 15:17-21</a>), and the Lord immediately turns to the subject of sin, revealing His compassionate foresight (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If you stray unintentionally</b><p>God distinguishes between willful rebellion and accidental missteps.<p>&#8226; Unintentional sins arise from ignorance, weakness, or oversight (<a href="/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Even these require atonement, proving holiness is more than good intentions (<a href="/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord makes provision before the offense occurs, underscoring His mercy (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and do not obey</b><p>Failure to obey, whether deliberate or accidental, still breaks covenant fellowship.<p>&#8226; Disobedience&#8212;no matter the motive&#8212;places a barrier between God and His people (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Grace does not erase responsibility; it empowers restoration (<a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse anticipates Christ, who covers both conscious and unconscious sin (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all these commandments</b><p>The plural &#8220;commandments&#8221; covers the entire revealed will of God.<p>&#8226; Selective obedience is not an option; the whole law reflects His character (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s standard never lowers; instead, He raises His people by sacrifice and Spirit (<a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Remembering every command would be impossible without divine help, foreshadowing the need for a new heart (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the LORD has spoken to Moses</b><p>Authority rests in the LORD&#8217;s spoken word delivered through His chosen mediator.<p>&#8226; Moses heard directly from God (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>), guaranteeing accuracy.<p>&#8226; Scripture carries that same authority for us today (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Rejecting or neglecting what God spoke through Moses ultimately rejects what He later spoke through His Son (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22</a> reassures Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that God foresees every unintended lapse and graciously provides a path back through prescribed sacrifice, fulfilled perfectly in Christ.

Perhaps it is a part of the thoroughly unscientific and inartificial character of the Mosaic legislation that a principle of extreme importance and wide application is appended to an insignificant matter of ceremonial. Provision is here made for the forgiveness of sins due to ignorance and oversight - a provision which was sorely needed, considering the great complexity of the Law, and the bad training they had for the accurate observance of it (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-8.htm">Deuteronomy 12:8</a>).
