Gold, a precious metal, signifies value and purity, often associated with divinity and kingship in the Bible. The use of gold in the tabernacle and its furnishings (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>) reflects the holiness and glory of God. The dish itself, used for holding incense, symbolizes the prayers of the people rising to God, as seen in <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>, where incense represents the prayers of the saints.<p><b>weighing ten shekels</b><br>The weight of ten shekels indicates a specific measure, showing the importance of precision and order in worship. A shekel was a standard unit of weight in ancient Israel, approximately 11.4 grams. The number ten often symbolizes completeness or divine order in the Bible, as seen in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20). This precise weight underscores the careful adherence to God's instructions, reflecting the Israelites' commitment to honoring God with their offerings.<p><b>filled with incense</b><br>Incense in the Bible is frequently associated with worship and prayer. In <a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>, God gives Moses specific instructions for making incense, emphasizing its sacredness. The burning of incense in the tabernacle and later in the temple was a daily ritual, symbolizing the prayers of the people ascending to God. In <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, David likens his prayer to incense, highlighting its role as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. Incense also points to Christ, whose intercession for believers is a fragrant offering to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the offerings from the leaders of the tribes during the dedication of the altar.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nashon.htm">Nashon</a></b><br>The leader of the tribe of Judah, who brought the offering described in this verse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where the offerings were brought for the dedication.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_judah.htm">Tribe of Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, represented by Nashon in this offering.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/dedication_of_the_altar.htm">Dedication of the Altar</a></b><br>A significant event where leaders of each tribe brought offerings for the consecration of the altar in the Tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_offerings.htm">The Significance of Offerings</a></b><br>Offerings in the Old Testament were a tangible expression of worship and dedication to God.
