This phrase indicates that the woman is married and living under her husband's authority. The cultural context of the time placed significant emphasis on the husband's role in overseeing the spiritual and practical commitments of his household. This reflects the broader biblical theme of headship and submission within marriage, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>, where wives are instructed to submit to their husbands as to the Lord.<p><b>has made a vow</b><br>Vows were solemn promises made to God, often involving a commitment to perform a specific act or abstain from certain activities. In the Old Testament, vows were taken seriously and were considered binding (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-23</a>). The making of vows was a common practice, reflecting a person's devotion and dedication to God. This phrase highlights the woman's personal agency in making spiritual commitments, even within the constraints of a patriarchal society.<p><b>or put herself under an obligation with an oath</b><br>An oath was a formal declaration, often invoking God as a witness, to affirm the truth of a statement or the fulfillment of a promise. In biblical times, oaths were considered sacred and inviolable (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). This phrase underscores the gravity of making such commitments, as breaking an oath was seen as a serious offense against God. The inclusion of both vows and oaths in this passage emphasizes the importance of integrity and faithfulness in one's words and promises, a theme echoed in Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, where He advises against making oaths lightly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/woman.htm">Woman</a></b><br>The primary subject in this verse, representing individuals who make vows or commitments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/husband.htm">Husband</a></b><br>The authority figure in the household, responsible for the oversight of vows made by his wife.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/house.htm">House</a></b><br>Symbolizes the family unit and the place where the vow is made, indicating the context of domestic life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vow.htm">Vow</a></b><br>A solemn promise or commitment made to God, reflecting the seriousness of one's word.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/obligation_with_an_oath.htm">Obligation with an Oath</a></b><br>A binding promise that carries spiritual and moral weight, emphasizing accountability.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_vows.htm">The Sanctity of Vows</a></b><br>Vows are sacred commitments made before God and should be taken seriously.
