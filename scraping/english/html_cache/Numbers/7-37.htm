The silver platter, weighing 130 shekels, signifies a substantial and valuable gift. Silver in the Bible often symbolizes redemption and purity. The weight of the platter, measured in shekels, aligns with the sanctuary shekel, a standard weight used in the tabernacle, ensuring uniformity and fairness in offerings. This offering reflects the leader's commitment and the community's collective dedication to God.<p><b>and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels</b><br>The silver bowl, weighing 70 shekels, complements the platter, emphasizing the importance of the offering. The number 70 in the Bible can symbolize completeness or the nations, as seen in the 70 nations listed in <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>. The use of silver again underscores themes of redemption and value. The bowl's purpose, like the platter, is to hold the grain offering, which is a significant part of the sacrificial system, representing sustenance and provision from God.<p><b>both according to the sanctuary shekel</b><br>The sanctuary shekel was a specific standard of weight used in the tabernacle, ensuring that all offerings were measured equally and fairly. This standardization reflects God's order and justice, ensuring that each leader's offering was of equal value and significance. It also points to the importance of integrity and honesty in worship and offerings to God.<p><b>and filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, consisting of fine flour mixed with oil, was a common type of offering in the Old Testament, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving to God. Fine flour represents the best of the harvest, indicating that offerings to God should be of the highest quality. Oil, often symbolizing the Holy Spirit, adds richness and anointing to the offering. This mixture was a pleasing aroma to the Lord, signifying the worshiper's devotion and gratitude.
