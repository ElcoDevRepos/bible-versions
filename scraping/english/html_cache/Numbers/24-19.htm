This is significant as it ties into the broader biblical narrative of God's covenant with the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, promising that their descendants would be a blessing to the nations (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). The ruler from Jacob is often interpreted as a messianic prophecy, pointing to Jesus Christ, who is a descendant of Jacob through the tribe of Judah (<a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2-16</a>). This prophecy aligns with other Old Testament predictions of a coming king or Messiah, such as in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, where the scepter is said not to depart from Judah.<p><b>and destroy the survivors of the city.</b><br>This part of the prophecy indicates a future act of judgment and conquest. In the immediate context, it could refer to the historical conquests of the Israelites over the Canaanite cities as they entered the Promised Land. However, from a prophetic and typological perspective, it can also be seen as a reference to the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and evil. The "city" can symbolize the strongholds of opposition against God's kingdom. In <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>, Christ is depicted as a conquering king who defeats the forces of evil. This phrase underscores the theme of divine justice and the establishment of God's righteous rule, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch whose descendants form the twelve tribes of Israel.

Isaiah wrote, &#8220;The government will be on His shoulders&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), and the angel told Mary, &#8220;He will reign over the house of Jacob forever&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; Those passages line up perfectly with the ruler in Balaam&#8217;s oracle: someone who is both royal and divinely appointed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will come</b><p>&#8226; The verb is future&#8212;certainty yet anticipation. Balaam said earlier, &#8220;I see him, but not now&#8230; a Star will come out of Jacob&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Centuries later Paul celebrates the fulfillment: &#8220;When the fullness of time had come, God sent His Son&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; In Peter&#8217;s sermon the same note sounds: &#8220;that He may send Jesus, the Christ appointed for you&#8221; (<a href="/acts/3-20.htm">Acts 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from Jacob</b><p>&#8226; The ruler&#8217;s origin is ethnic and covenantal: Jacob, the patriarch renamed Israel. &#8220;Through your offspring all nations of the earth will be blessed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise narrows to Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>) and then to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>), culminating in the genealogy that begins, &#8220;Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul affirms this lineage when he writes that the Messiah is &#8220;from their race, according to the flesh&#8221; (<a href="/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and destroy</b><p>&#8226; The same One who saves also judges. <a href="/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a> says, &#8220;You will break them with an iron scepter.&#8221;<p>&#8226; At His return, &#8220;He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul looks ahead: &#8220;Then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father, after He has destroyed all dominion, authority, and power&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the survivors</b><p>&#8226; Balaam foresees a final, decisive victory.
