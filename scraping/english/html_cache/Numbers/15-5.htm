Each lamb offered as a burnt offering was to be completely consumed by fire, representing total surrender to God. This practice is rooted in the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>. The lamb is a significant symbol throughout Scripture, often representing innocence and purity. This foreshadows Jesus Christ, referred to as the "Lamb of God" in <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, who was sacrificed for the sins of humanity.<p><b>you are to prepare a quarter hin of wine</b><br>A hin is an ancient unit of liquid measurement, approximately equivalent to 1.5 gallons or 5.7 liters. A quarter hin would thus be about 1.4 liters. Wine, in this context, was used as a drink offering, poured out as a libation to accompany the burnt offering. This act of pouring out wine symbolizes joy, celebration, and the fullness of life, as well as the pouring out of one's life in service to God. The use of wine in offerings is also seen in <a href="/genesis/35-14.htm">Genesis 35:14</a>, where Jacob pours out a drink offering to God.<p><b>as a drink offering</b><br>The drink offering, or "nesek" in Hebrew, was a common practice in the sacrificial system, often accompanying burnt offerings and grain offerings. It signifies the dedication of the offerer's life and resources to God. The drink offering is a precursor to the New Testament understanding of being "poured out" for others, as Paul describes in <a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>. This act of pouring out is also a type of Christ's sacrifice, as He poured out His blood for the new covenant (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>). The drink offering, therefore, points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who gave His life for the redemption of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including those concerning offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given specific instructions on how to worship and offer sacrifices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites received these laws, as they journeyed from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where offerings and sacrifices were made.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_system.htm">Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The divinely instituted method of worship and atonement for sin, involving various offerings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites were given specific instructions for offerings, emphasizing the importance of obedience in worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_wine.htm">Symbolism of Wine</a></b><br>Wine as a drink offering symbolizes joy and fellowship with God, pointing to the New Testament where wine represents the blood of Christ in communion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holistic_worship.htm">Holistic Worship</a></b><br>Worship involves more than just the act of sacrifice; it includes the heart and intention behind the offering.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/foreshadowing_christ.htm">Foreshadowing Christ</a></b><br>The sacrificial system foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who fulfills the law and offers a new covenant.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_worship.htm">Community and Worship</a></b><br>The communal aspect of offerings reminds believers of the importance of corporate worship and unity in the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_15_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 15:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Num_15_5_guide_our_offerings.htm">How does Numbers 15:5 guide us in offering our best to God?
