This measurement reflects the importance of precision in God's commands, emphasizing order and structure. The eastward direction is often associated with new beginnings in biblical symbolism, as the sun rises in the east, suggesting a fresh start for those seeking refuge.<p><b>two thousand on the south,</b><br>The southern boundary, like the others, is set at two thousand cubits, ensuring uniformity around the city. The south in biblical terms can symbolize warmth and growth, as it is associated with the direction of the sun's path. This could imply a nurturing environment for those who reside within the city of refuge.<p><b>two thousand on the west,</b><br>The western boundary also extends two thousand cubits. In biblical narratives, the west can symbolize the end of a journey or the setting of the sun, which might represent the conclusion of one's past life and the beginning of a new chapter within the city of refuge. This direction is significant in the context of the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land, which lay to the west of their wilderness wanderings.<p><b>and two thousand on the north,</b><br>The northern boundary completes the square around the city. The north is often associated with danger or judgment in biblical literature, as invaders typically came from the north. However, in this context, it serves as a protective measure, ensuring that the city is equally defended on all sides, providing safety and security for those within.<p><b>with the city in the center.</b><br>Placing the city in the center of these boundaries highlights its role as a focal point of refuge and justice. This centrality can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the center of Christian faith and the ultimate refuge for believers. The city&#8217;s central position ensures equal access from all directions, symbolizing the impartiality and fairness of God's provision.<p><b>These areas will serve as larger pasturelands for the cities.</b><br>The designation of these areas as pasturelands indicates a practical purpose, providing sustenance for the inhabitants and their livestock. This reflects God's provision and care for His people, ensuring that their physical needs are met. The pasturelands also symbolize peace and rest, as they are places where flocks can graze safely, echoing the pastoral imagery found in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where the Lord is depicted as a shepherd providing for His flock.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom God gave the laws and instructions through Moses.

God&#8217;s people do not guess at holiness; they measure it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the east</b><p>East often carries redemptive overtones. The garden was planted &#8220;in the east&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>), and Judah&#8217;s camp&#8212;through whom Messiah would come&#8212;was stationed on the east side of the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>). Marking the first sector to the sunrise reminds Israel that fresh mercy and renewed worship begin each day with God-given light.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>two thousand on the south</b><p>Balance continues. Just as the south side of the tabernacle had its set frames (<a href="/exodus/26-18.htm">Exodus 26:18</a>) and Ezekiel&#8217;s future land has a defined southern border (<a href="/ezekiel/48-28.htm">Ezekiel 48:28</a>), the Levite city receives an equal southern span. Equality in every direction affirms that God shows no partiality; His servants minister from a place of symmetry and stability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>two thousand on the west</b><p>Facing the Great Sea, the western boundary recalls <a href="/joshua/15-12.htm">Joshua 15:12</a>, where the sea marked Judah&#8217;s limit, and <a href="/deuteronomy/3-27.htm">Deuteronomy 3:27</a>, where Moses views the land from the westward vantage. Here the pastureland meets the horizon, hinting at provision that reaches as far as God chooses to supply.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and two thousand on the north</b><p>The northern measure completes the square. Israel had tribes camping to the north (<a href="/numbers/2-25.htm">Numbers 2:25</a>) and prophetic visions of a city with north gates (<a href="/ezekiel/48-30.htm">Ezekiel 48:30</a>).

East to west, north to south, the Lord carves out space where His servants can flourish and where those seeking refuge can quickly reach safety. Centering the city underscores that worship and justice belong at the heart of Israel&#8217;s life, while the surrounding pasturelands demonstrate the faithful care of the God who supplies every need of those devoted to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits . . . --</span>The explanation of this passage commonly given by Jewish writers is that the area included by four lines drawn at a distance of 1,000 cubits from the walls of the city was to be allotted to the Levites for their cattle, and a larger area included by four lines drawn at a distance of 2,000 cubits from the inner suburbs was to be allotted to them for vineyards, &c. The explanation of J. D. Michaelis is, that only an area included by four lines drawn at a distance of 1,000 cubits from the walls of the city was to be assigned to the Levites, and that the length of the city walls, supposing the city to be square, was to be added to the 2,000 cubits of the four boundary lines. The Greek text has 2,000 in <a href="/numbers/35-4.htm" title="And the suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.">Numbers 35:4</a> as in <a href="/numbers/35-5.htm" title="And you shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the middle: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.">Numbers 35:5</a>. According to the former of these explanations it is supposed that the space included in the first thousand cubits from the city walls was designed for the cattle, and that the space included in the 2,000 cubits beyond the walls was designed for vineyards, &c., or <span class= "ital">vice versa. </span>According to the explanation of this passage which has been suggested by J. D. Michaelis, it is supposed that the length of the city wall was added to the 2,000 cubits in every case, so that, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in the case of a city the walls of which were 1,000 cubits in length and breadth, the suburbs would be 3,000 cubits in length and breadth; and in the case of a city the walls of which were 500 cubits in length and breadth, the suburbs would measure 2,500 cubits in length and breadth. It is obvious that, if this supposition be correct, the size of the suburbs would vary in each case with that of the city, so that the suburbs of the larger city, in which there would, in all probability, be a greater number of resident Levites, would be greater than those of a smaller city, in which the number of Levites would probably be less. At the same time, the explanation does not accord so nearly as the preceding with the direction that in every case the measure was to be 2,000 cubits.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall measure from without the city</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)... <span class="cmt_word">two thousand cubits.</span> These directions are very obscure. Some have held that the country for 1000 cubits beyond the walls was reserved for pasture (according to verse 4), and for another 1000 cubits for fields and vineyards, so that the Levitical lands extended 2000 cubits in all directions. This is reasonable in itself, since 2000 cubits is only half a mile, and rather more than a square mile of land would not seem too much for pastures, gardens, etc. for a town with at least 1000 inhabitants. The smallest tribe territories seem to have comprised some 300 square miles of country; and if we take the Levitical towns as averaging 1000 cubits square, their forty-eight cities would only give them seventy-three square miles of territory. There is, however, no notice of anything being given to the Levites except their "suburbs," so that this explanation must be at best very doubtful. Others have argued for a plan according to which each outer boundary, drawn at 1000 cubits' distance from the wall, would measure 2000 cubits, plus the length of the town wall; but this is far too artificial, and could only be considered possible as long as it was confined to a paper sketch, for it presupposes that each city lay four-square, and faced the four points of the compass. If the first explanation be untenable, the only alternative sufficiently simple and natural is to suppose that, in order to avoid irregularities of measurement, each outer boundary was to be drawn at an approximate distance of 1000 cubits from the wall, and each of an approximate length of 2000 cubits; at the angles the lines would have to be joined as best they might. In <a href="/leviticus/25-32.htm">Leviticus 25:32-34</a> certain regulations are inserted in favour of the Levites. Their houses might be redeemed at any time, and not only within the full year allowed to others; moreover, they returned to them (contrary to the general rule) at the year of Jubilee. Their property in the "suburbs" they could not sell at all, for it was inalienable. It is difficult to believe that these regulations were really made at Mount Sinai, presupposing, as they do, the legislation of this chapter; but if they were actually made at this time, on the eve of the conquest, it is easy to see why they were subsequently inserted in the chapter which deals generally with the powers of sale and redemption. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/35-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You are also to measure</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1438;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mad&#183;d&#333;&#183;&#7791;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
