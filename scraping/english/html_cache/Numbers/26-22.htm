Judah was one of the twelve sons of Jacob, and his descendants formed one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The tribe of Judah is notable for its leadership role among the tribes, as it was prophesied in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a> that the scepter would not depart from Judah, indicating a royal lineage. This prophecy is fulfilled in the line of King David and ultimately in Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" in <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>. The tribe's prominence is also seen in its central role during the wilderness wanderings and its position in the camp and march formations as described in the Book of Numbers.<p><b>and their registration numbered 76,500</b><br>The census of the tribe of Judah, numbering 76,500, reflects its status as the largest tribe at this point in Israel's history. This census was conducted as part of the second numbering of the Israelites in the wilderness, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a>. The increase in numbers from the first census (<a href="/numbers/1-27.htm">Numbers 1:27</a>, where Judah numbered 74,600) indicates the tribe's growth and vitality despite the challenges faced during the wilderness period. This growth can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham to make his descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). The large number also underscores Judah's military strength and its future role in leading the conquest of Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to become a powerful leader in Egypt.

Ephraim often symbolized the northern kingdom of Israel in later biblical history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/machir.htm">Machir</a></b><br>The son of Manasseh, Machir's descendants formed the Machirite clan.

The opening phrase, &#8220;These were the clans,&#8221; points to God&#8217;s faithfulness in preserving specific family lines. Earlier, God promised Abraham that his descendants would be innumerable (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>), and in spite of wilderness judgments (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>), the clans still stand. The survival and organization of these clans underscore orderly covenant community life, echoed later when Ezra lists returning exiles by family groups (<a href="/ezra/2-3.htm">Ezra 2:3-35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Judah</b><p>Judah was the tribe destined for leadership. Jacob&#8217;s blessing foretold, &#8220;The scepter will not depart from Judah&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), a prophecy ultimately fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>). During the march through the wilderness, Judah led the first camp (<a href="/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3-4</a>). Caleb, a notable Judahite, had just been singled out for his faith (<a href="/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>). By specifying &#8220;of Judah,&#8221; the verse reminds readers that God is keeping the royal line intact, a thread that runs through <a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18-22</a> and <a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2-16</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and their registration numbered 76,500</b><p>The total shows a growth of 1,900 since the first census (<a href="/numbers/1-27.htm">Numbers 1:27</a>). While other tribes lost men through rebellion and plague (<a href="/bsb/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16&#8211;17</a>; 25:9), Judah increased, reflecting divine favor. Similar numeric records appear when David counts his men (<a href="/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a>) and when John hears the number of the sealed (<a href="/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4-8</a>), each emphasizing God&#8217;s detailed oversight. The tally also reminds us that God equips His people with sufficient strength for upcoming battles in Canaan (<a href="/joshua/1-2.htm">Joshua 1:2-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/26-22.htm">Numbers 26:22</a> is more than a headcount.
