Offerings were a way to express devotion, gratitude, and obedience. The term "food offering" indicates that the offering is meant to be a pleasing aroma to the LORD, symbolizing the worshiper's desire to honor God. This practice is rooted in the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where offerings were a means of maintaining fellowship with God.<p><b>a burnt offering of two young bulls</b><br>The burnt offering, or "olah" in Hebrew, signifies complete surrender to God, as the entire animal is consumed by fire. Bulls were considered valuable and symbolized strength and service, reflecting the worshiper's dedication. The use of two young bulls indicates the importance of the offering, as bulls were among the most costly sacrifices. This offering is part of the prescribed sacrifices for the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which follows Passover, highlighting the theme of redemption and deliverance.<p><b>one ram</b><br>Rams were often used in significant sacrificial events, such as the consecration of priests (<a href="/exodus/29.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>) and the binding of Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>). The ram symbolizes leadership and substitution, pointing to the idea of a substitute sacrifice. In the context of the sacrificial system, the ram's inclusion underscores the completeness and sufficiency of the offering.<p><b>and seven male lambs a year old</b><br>The number seven in the Bible often represents completeness or perfection, suggesting that the offering is complete and perfect in its intent. Male lambs, especially those a year old, were considered ideal for sacrifice due to their purity and innocence. This can be seen as a type of Christ, the Lamb of God, who was without blemish and offered for the sins of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>all unblemished</b><br>The requirement for the animals to be unblemished reflects God's standard of holiness and perfection. Sacrifices offered to God had to be without defect, symbolizing the purity and holiness required to approach God. This foreshadows the perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who was without sin and offered Himself as the ultimate atonement for humanity's sins (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). The emphasis on unblemished offerings highlights the need for purity in worship and the seriousness of approaching a holy God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who commands the offerings and sacrifices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who receives and communicates God's laws and instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are commanded to follow these sacrificial laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the offerings are made, serving as the dwelling place of God among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_unleavened_bread.htm">Feast of Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>The context of this offering, a significant event in the Jewish calendar commemorating the Exodus from Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites were required to follow God's specific instructions for offerings.

The command is relational&#8212;the people are not merely performing ritual; they are drawing near to the covenant God who redeemed them from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>). Every sacrifice is a response to His initiative, echoing earlier calls such as <a href="/leviticus/1-2.htm">Leviticus 1:2</a> and <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where worship involves giving ourselves wholly to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a food offering</b><p>The phrase &#8220;a food offering&#8221; links this sacrifice to the grain and drink portions that always accompanied animal offerings (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-4.htm">Numbers 15:4&#8211;10</a>). God does not consume food as humans do (<a href="/psalms/50-12.htm">Psalm 50:12&#8211;13</a>), yet He describes it this way to show that the aroma of obedient worship &#8220;pleases&#8221; Him (<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>). The offering highlights God&#8217;s desire to fellowship with His people at His table, just as He later invites believers to the Lord&#8217;s Supper (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a burnt offering</b><p>A burnt offering (&#703;olah) was completely consumed on the altar (<a href="/leviticus/1-8.htm">Leviticus 1:8&#8211;9</a>).

Requiring two on the opening day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread (<a href="/numbers/28-17.htm">Numbers 28:17&#8211;20</a>) underscored the gravity of sin and the abundance of God&#8217;s provision. Solomon later offered &#8220;twenty-two thousand cattle&#8221; at the temple dedication (<a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>), showing continuity in emphasizing the greatness of God by costly gifts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one ram</b><p>The single ram recalls Abraham&#8217;s substitute for Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>).

Placing the ram between the bulls and the lambs bridges the picture of power with innocence, pointing to Christ who is both mighty (<a href="/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12</a>) and the sacrificial substitute.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and seven male lambs a year old</b><p>Seven&#8212;the biblical number of completeness (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2&#8211;3</a>)&#8212;combined with year-old lambs (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>) paints a portrait of perfect provision. The Passover context deepens this: one lamb had delivered each household in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3&#8211;8</a>); now seven lambs proclaim full, ongoing redemption. <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> later identifies Jesus as &#8220;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world,&#8221; fulfilling this pattern completely.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all unblemished</b><p>Every animal had to be flawless (<a href="/leviticus/22-20.htm">Leviticus 22:20</a>).
