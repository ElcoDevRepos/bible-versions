This act of defiance against God's commandments was a direct challenge to the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The phrase indicates Phinehas's awareness and immediate reaction to the situation, highlighting the importance of vigilance in spiritual leadership.<p><b>Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest</b><br>Phinehas's lineage is significant, as he is the grandson of Aaron, the first high priest of Israel.

His zeal for God's holiness is reminiscent of Aaron's role in interceding for the people.<p><b>got up from the assembly</b><br>Phinehas's decision to rise from the assembly signifies his readiness to take decisive action.

In the context of <a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>, the spear becomes an instrument of God's wrath against sin.
