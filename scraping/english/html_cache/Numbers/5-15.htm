This directive reflects the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where religious and civil matters were intertwined. The priest's role here underscores the seriousness of the situation, as it involves potential sin and community integrity.<p><b>He must also bring for her an offering of a tenth of an ephah of barley flour.</b><br>The offering of barley flour, rather than the more common wheat, signifies a lower status or a more humble offering. Barley was often considered the grain of the poor. The specific measure, a tenth of an ephah, indicates a precise requirement, reflecting the order and structure of the sacrificial system. This offering is part of the ritual to determine the truth of the wife's faithfulness, emphasizing the importance of justice and truth in the community.<p><b>He is not to pour oil over it or put frankincense on it,</b><br>Oil and frankincense were typically added to offerings to make them more pleasing and fragrant, symbolizing joy and thanksgiving. Their absence here indicates the somber nature of this offering. It is not a celebration but a serious inquiry into potential sin. This lack of embellishment highlights the gravity of the situation and the focus on uncovering truth rather than offering praise.<p><b>because it is a grain offering for jealousy,</b><br>This specific type of offering is unique, designed to address suspicions of infidelity. Jealousy, in this context, is not merely an emotion but a potential breach of covenantal faithfulness, reflecting God's own jealousy for His people's faithfulness. The offering serves as a tangible expression of the husband's concern and the community's commitment to righteousness.<p><b>an offering of memorial as a reminder of iniquity.</b><br>The term "memorial" here suggests that the offering serves as a reminder or record of the situation, bringing the issue before God. It acknowledges the potential sin and seeks divine judgment. This reflects the broader biblical theme of remembrance, where offerings and rituals often serve to remind the people of their covenant with God and the consequences of sin. The focus on iniquity underscores the moral and spiritual dimensions of the law, pointing to the need for holiness and purity among God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_husband.htm">The Husband</a></b><br>The man who suspects his wife of infidelity and brings her to the priest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wife.htm">The Wife</a></b><br>The woman accused of being unfaithful, who is brought before the priest.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The religious leader who performs the ritual and receives the offering.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The sacred place where the ritual is conducted.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offering.htm">The Offering</a></b><br>A tenth of an ephah of barley flour, brought as a grain offering for jealousy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jealousy.htm">Understanding Jealousy</a></b><br>Jealousy can be a destructive force in relationships.
