In the context of ancient Israel, the law was given to Moses on Mount Sinai and was meant to govern the lives of the Israelites. The use of "the same law and the same ordinance" underscores the idea that God's standards are consistent and unchanging. This reflects God's character as just and impartial, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>, which states that God shows no partiality. The law included moral, ceremonial, and civil aspects, all of which were to be observed by the community.<p><b>will apply both to you</b><br>"You" refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who were delivered from Egypt and given the Promised Land. The Israelites were to be a holy nation, set apart to demonstrate God's holiness and righteousness to the world. This phrase reinforces the covenant relationship between God and Israel, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, where God calls Israel a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation."<p><b>and to the foreigner residing with you.</b><br>The inclusion of the "foreigner" or "sojourner" highlights the inclusive nature of God's law. In ancient times, foreigners living among the Israelites were often vulnerable and without rights. By applying the same law to both Israelites and foreigners, God ensured justice and protection for all. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's concern for the marginalized, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>, which commands the Israelites to love the foreigner as themselves. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Gentile (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), pointing to the ultimate unity and equality found in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God and communicated them to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were given the Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners (Gerim)</a></b><br>Non-Israelites residing among the Israelites, who were also subject to the same laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_of_sinai.htm">Wilderness of Sinai</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites received the Law from God through Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God who established the covenant with Israel and provided the Law.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/equality_before_god.htm">Equality Before God</a></b><br>God's law applies equally to all, regardless of nationality or status.
