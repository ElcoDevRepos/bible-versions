The Levites were set apart for the service of the tabernacle, and their duties were distinct from those of the other tribes of Israel. This census was crucial for organizing the responsibilities and ensuring that the tabernacle was properly maintained. The Levites were not counted among the fighting men of Israel, as their role was spiritual and logistical rather than military.<p><b>was 8,580.</b><br>The specific number of 8,580 men indicates the total count of Levites between the ages of thirty and fifty, the age range designated for active service in the tabernacle. This precise number underscores the importance of order and structure in the worship and service of God. The detailed record-keeping reflects the broader biblical theme of God's attention to detail and the importance of each individual's role in His plan. This number also highlights the significant manpower required for the maintenance and transportation of the tabernacle, emphasizing the communal effort in worship and service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>The tribe of Levi, set apart for the service of the Tabernacle.

No doubt it <span class="accented">was</span> carried out with extreme solicitude, as made for a purpose especially sacred and important. The results are remarkable in more ways than one. The following table presents the numbers in each family above one month, and between the ages of thirty and fifty. Kohath, 86002750percent 32<br />Gershon, 75002630 <span class="accented"></span><span class="accented"> </span>35<br />Merari, 62003200 5122,800858038The first conclusion which naturally arises from these figures is, that after all the numbering must have been made by tens, and not by individuals. As it was impossible that 3000 persons could be employed in carrying the various portions of the tabernacle, it may be that each group of ten undertook a unit of responsibility. The second consideration is, that the average of men between thirty and fifty in all Levi is higher than modern statistics show (it is said to be twenty-five per cent. now in the whole population), although not very materially. The third is, that this average is very unequally distributed, rising to a most remarkable proportion in the case of Merari. It is quite clear that something must have disturbed the relative numbers as between the Merarites and the other families. It has been suggested that the small number of male Levites generally, and the small number of male Kohathites, between thirty and fifty especially, may have been caused by heavy losses incurred in carrying out the Divine sentence upon the worshippers of the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>). But - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The slow increase of Levi continued to be very observable down to the time of David; while the other tribes grew from 600,000 to 1,300,000, he only increased to 38,000 (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3</a>). <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The average of males over thirty is already higher among the Kohathites than might have been expected; it is the largeness of the number, not the smallness, which needs to be explained. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> It is Merari, and not Kohath, that is markedly distinguished from the other two: there is little difference between Kohath and Gershon. It is evident that something must have happened to the tribe of Levi, and in especial to the family of Merari, to reduce very greatly the number of births within the last thirty years. We do not know what the causes were, or why they should have pressed much more heavily on one tribe, or one family, than on another; but it is easy to see that many such causes may have acted, and acted unequally, under the cruel tyranny of Pharaoh. The children may have been systematically slaughtered, or marriages may have largely ceased, while Moses was in the land of Midian. If this were generally the case, it would much diminish the estimated total of the nation, and still more the estimated difficulties of the march. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/4-48.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yih&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the number of men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1467;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#601;&#183;qu&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6485.htm">Strong's 6485: </a> </span><span class="str2">To visit, to oversee, muster, charge, care for, miss, deposit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was 8,580.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1504;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#333;&#183;na&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8083.htm">Strong's 8083: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cardinal number, eight, eighth</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/4-48.htm">Numbers 4:48 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/4-48.htm">Numbers 4:48 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/4-48.htm">Numbers 4:48 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/4-48.htm">Numbers 4:48 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/4-48.htm">Numbers 4:48 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/4-48.htm">Numbers 4:48  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/4-48.htm">Numbers 4:48 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/4-48.htm">Numbers 4:48 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/4-48.htm">Numbers 4:48 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/4-48.htm">Numbers 4:48 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/4-48.htm">OT Law: Numbers 4:48 Even those who were numbered of them (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/4-47.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 4:47"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 4:47" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/4-49.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 4:49"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 4:49" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
