The land's quality was crucial for sustaining the nation. Historically, Canaan was known for its fertile soil and agricultural potential, often described as "a land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). This phrase indicates the abundance and prosperity that awaited the Israelites, aligning with God's promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The question also underscores the need for discernment and wisdom in assessing God's promises, as the spies were tasked with evaluating the land's potential for supporting the Israelite community.<p><b>Are the cities where they dwell open camps or fortifications?</b><br>This inquiry addresses the military and strategic aspects of the conquest. Open camps would suggest a nomadic or less defended lifestyle, making them easier targets for conquest. In contrast, fortified cities would indicate a more advanced and potentially challenging adversary. Archaeological evidence from the Late Bronze Age shows that many Canaanite cities had significant fortifications, such as Jericho, which had massive walls (<a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6:1-5</a>). This question also foreshadows the challenges the Israelites would face in taking possession of the land, requiring reliance on God's power rather than their own strength, as seen in the eventual fall of Jericho. The concept of fortifications can also be seen as a type of spiritual stronghold, which believers are called to overcome through faith in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who sent the twelve spies to scout the land of Canaan.
