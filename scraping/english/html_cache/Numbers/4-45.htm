The Levites were set apart for the service of the Tabernacle, and each clan had specific duties. The Merarites were responsible for the heavier structural elements of the Tabernacle, such as the frames, bars, pillars, and bases. This allocation of duties highlights the organized and communal nature of Israelite worship, where each group had a role to play. The counting of the Merarites, like the other Levite clans, underscores the importance of order and preparation in the service of God.<p><b>whom Moses and Aaron numbered</b><br>Moses and Aaron, as leaders of Israel, were responsible for ensuring that the Levites were properly organized for their service. This numbering was not merely a census but a divinely ordained task to prepare the Levites for their sacred duties. Moses, as the prophet and leader, and Aaron, as the high priest, worked together to fulfill God's commands, demonstrating the unity required in spiritual leadership. This act of numbering also reflects the broader biblical theme of God knowing and calling His people by name, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>.<p><b>at the LORD&#8217;s command</b><br>The numbering of the Levites was done according to God's specific instructions, emphasizing the importance of obedience to divine directives. This command from the LORD highlights His sovereignty and the necessity for His people to follow His guidance precisely. The phrase underscores the belief that all aspects of worship and service must align with God's will, a principle that is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, where obedience is valued over sacrifice.<p><b>through Moses</b><br>Moses served as the mediator between God and the Israelites, a role that prefigures the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ. Just as Moses conveyed God's commands to the people, Christ is the mediator of the new covenant, as described in <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>. This phrase also emphasizes the prophetic role of Moses, who faithfully communicated God's instructions to ensure that the community functioned according to divine order. Moses' leadership and obedience serve as a model for spiritual leaders in all generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
