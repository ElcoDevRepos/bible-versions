The Israelites requested passage through his land, promising not to harm fields or vineyards, similar to their request to Edom (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>). Sihon's refusal highlights the hostility Israel faced from surrounding nations. This event fulfills God's earlier warning that Israel would encounter resistance (<a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31-33</a>). Sihon's denial also sets the stage for God's deliverance and the expansion of Israel's territory, as promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>Instead, he gathered his whole army and went out to confront Israel in the wilderness.</b><br>Sihon's decision to mobilize his entire army indicates the threat he perceived from Israel. The wilderness, often a place of testing and divine encounters for Israel, becomes a battlefield. This confrontation reflects the broader theme of spiritual warfare, where God's people face opposition but are called to trust in His deliverance. The gathering of Sihon's army also prefigures the gathering of nations against God's people, as seen in prophetic literature (Ezekiel 38-39).<p><b>When he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel.</b><br>Jahaz was a strategic location east of the Jordan River, significant for its role in Israel's conquest of the Promised Land. The battle at Jahaz is a pivotal moment where God demonstrates His power and faithfulness by granting Israel victory over a formidable enemy. This victory is a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as Israel's triumph over Sihon foreshadows the spiritual victories believers have in Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>). The battle also serves as a reminder of God's promise to fight for His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-30.htm">Deuteronomy 1:30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon.htm">Sihon</a></b><br>The king of the Amorites, who refused Israel passage through his land and chose to confront them in battle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of God's chosen people, led by Moses, journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jahaz.htm">Jahaz</a></b><br>The location where Sihon confronted Israel, leading to a significant battle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The area surrounding the land of the Amorites, where Israel was traveling.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amorites.htm">The Amorites</a></b><br>A group of people inhabiting the land that Israel sought to pass through on their way to Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_human_affairs.htm">God's Sovereignty in Human Affairs</a></b><br>This passage illustrates God's control over nations and leaders, using their decisions to fulfill His divine purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Israel's journey through hostile territories reminds believers to trust in God's promises, even when facing opposition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Just as Israel faced physical battles, Christians face spiritual battles and must rely on God's strength and guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_courage.htm">Obedience and Courage</a></b><br>Israel's willingness to confront Sihon demonstrates the importance of obedience to God's direction and courage in the face of adversity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>The victory over Sihon is a testament to God's faithfulness in delivering His people, encouraging believers to trust in His deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_21_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 21:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_21_23_God_s_guidance_in_battle.htm">How does Numbers 21:23 demonstrate God's guidance in Israel's military actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_obedience_in_Numbers_21_23.htm">What can we learn about obedience from Israel's response in Numbers 21:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Numbers_21_23_to_Genesis_promises.htm">How does Numbers 21:23 connect with God's promises to Abraham in Genesis?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_should_Christians_face_opposition_today.htm">How should Christians today respond when facing opposition, as seen in Numbers 21:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Faith_s_role_in_overcoming_obstacles.htm">What role does faith play in overcoming obstacles, as illustrated in Numbers 21:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Sihon_deny_Israel_passage.htm">Why did Sihon refuse Israel passage through his land in Numbers 21:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_21_23_God_s_conquest_plan.htm">How does Numbers 21:23 reflect God's plan for Israel's conquest?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Numbers_21_23_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events in Numbers 21:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_numbers_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Numbers 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/evidence_of_israel's_defeat_of_sihon.htm">Numbers 21:23-24 &#8211; Is there any archaeological or historical corroboration for Israel&#8217;s defeat of King Sihon and the confiscation of his territory?
