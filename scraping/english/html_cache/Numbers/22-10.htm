This interaction highlights God's sovereignty and ability to use anyone to fulfill His purposes. Balaam's role as a prophet, despite his questionable motives, underscores the theme that God can speak through unexpected means. This phrase also sets the stage for the unfolding narrative where God&#8217;s will is revealed through Balaam, despite his initial intentions.<p><b>Balak son of Zippor</b><br>Balak, the king of Moab, is introduced as the instigator of the events that follow. His lineage, as the son of Zippor, situates him within the Moabite context, a people descended from Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>). The Moabites were often in conflict with Israel, and Balak's fear of the Israelites' growing power prompts him to seek Balaam's help. This reflects the historical tensions between Israel and its neighbors and sets the stage for the spiritual battle that ensues.<p><b>king of Moab</b><br>Moab was a region east of the Dead Sea, and its king, Balak, represents the political and military threat to Israel. The Moabites' fear of Israel is rooted in the Israelites' recent victories over the Amorites, as recorded earlier in Numbers. This geopolitical context emphasizes the perceived threat Israel posed to surrounding nations and highlights the broader narrative of Israel's journey to the Promised Land.<p><b>sent me this message</b><br>Balak's message to Balaam is a plea for help against Israel, whom he perceives as a formidable threat. This request for Balaam to curse Israel reflects the ancient belief in the power of spoken blessings and curses, a common practice in Near Eastern cultures. The narrative that follows demonstrates God's protection over Israel, as He prevents Balaam from cursing His chosen people. This phrase introduces the central conflict of the story, where divine intervention overrides human intentions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet known for his ability to bless or curse.

Balaam is speaking directly to the LORD, showing that God can and does reveal Himself even to a Gentile diviner (<a href="/numbers/22-9.htm">Numbers 22:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores that genuine dialogue with God is possible, yet it does not guarantee obedience; compare Saul&#8217;s conversations with God in <a href="/1_samuel/15-10.htm">1 Samuel 15:10&#8211;23</a>.<p>&#8226; Scripture treats this meeting as literal history, just as God&#8217;s nighttime warning to Abimelech was literal (<a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>).<p>&#8226; While Balaam&#8217;s heart is divided (<a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>; <a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 11</a>), God still controls the conversation, reminding us that &#8220;the LORD has established His throne in the heavens&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Balak son of Zippor</b><p>&#8226; Balaam identifies the sender by name, confirming the historical setting recorded earlier in <a href="/numbers/22-2.htm">Numbers 22:2</a>.<p>&#8226; Naming Balak reveals accountability: God knows exactly who is opposing His people, just as He knew Pharaoh by name (<a href="/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; The personal reference exposes Balak&#8217;s fear-driven motives&#8212;he has heard of Israel&#8217;s victories (<a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; By repeating Balak&#8217;s name to God, Balaam unwittingly admits he is merely a messenger; the true authority is the LORD (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>king of Moab</b><p>&#8226; Moab descends from Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-36.htm">Genesis 19:36&#8211;37</a>), making the conflict a family affair tinged with ancient tension (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Kings may wield earthly power, but their decrees bow before God&#8217;s covenant with Israel (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, Moab&#8217;s king represented a formidable threat; here, his title only highlights his impotence before the Almighty (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of &#8220;king&#8221; stresses political pressure on Balaam&#8212;yet allegiance to God must surpass fear of rulers (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sent me this message</b><p>&#8226; Balaam summarizes Balak&#8217;s request recorded in <a href="/numbers/22-5.htm">Numbers 22:5&#8211;6</a>: curse Israel &#8220;for they are too powerful for me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The statement exposes Balak&#8217;s strategy of seeking spiritual leverage when military power seems insufficient (compare <a href="/1_kings/13-33.htm">1 Kings 13:33</a>).<p>&#8226; It also reveals Balaam&#8217;s dilemma: lucrative reward versus obedience to God (<a href="/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God is not unaware of enemy plots; He turns curses into blessings (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-5.htm">Deuteronomy 23:5</a>), a theme that unfolds as Balaam&#8217;s attempts to curse become prophetic blessings (<a href="/bsb/numbers/23.htm">Numbers 23&#8211;24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/22-10.htm">Numbers 22:10</a> records Balaam repeating Balak&#8217;s commission to God. Each phrase spotlights a clash of authorities: a pagan king&#8217;s fear versus the sovereign LORD&#8217;s plan, a prophet for hire versus the God who speaks truth, and a threatened nation versus the unbreakable covenant. The verse sets the stage for God&#8217;s decisive response: Israel will be blessed, not cursed, no matter who schemes otherwise.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/22-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Balaam</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(bil&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1109.htm">Strong's 1109: </a> </span><span class="str2">Balaam -- a prophet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
