The bronze censers were used by Korah and his followers in their rebellion against Moses and Aaron, as recorded earlier in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>. The use of censers, typically associated with the burning of incense, signifies an attempt to usurp the priestly duties reserved for Aaron's lineage. This act of taking the censers by Eleazar underscores the restoration of proper priestly authority.<p><b>brought by those who had been burned up</b><br>The phrase refers to the followers of Korah who were consumed by fire as a divine judgment for their rebellion. This event serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of challenging God's appointed leaders and the sanctity of the priesthood. The burning up of the rebels is a literal fulfillment of God's judgment, emphasizing His holiness and the seriousness of maintaining His ordained order.<p><b>and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar</b><br>The censers, once instruments of rebellion, were repurposed to serve as a covering for the altar. This transformation symbolizes redemption and the idea that what was once used for sin can be consecrated for holy purposes. The overlaying of the altar with bronze from the censers serves as a perpetual reminder to the Israelites of the consequences of rebellion and the importance of obedience to God's commands. The altar, central to Israelite worship, now bore a physical reminder of God's judgment and mercy, pointing forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who redeems and transforms what is broken.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar_the_priest.htm">Eleazar the Priest</a></b><br>The son of Aaron, Eleazar was a key figure in the priesthood, responsible for carrying out God's commands regarding the tabernacle and its services.
