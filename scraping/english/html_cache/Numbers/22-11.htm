The Exodus is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing God's power and faithfulness. The mention of Egypt highlights the miraculous nature of their deliverance and the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>). The Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land is a central narrative in the Pentateuch, illustrating themes of redemption and covenant.<p><b>and they cover the face of the land</b><br>This imagery suggests the vast number of Israelites, emphasizing their growth from a small family into a great nation, as promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). The phrase also conveys a sense of threat to the surrounding nations, as the Israelites' presence is overwhelming. This fulfills God's promise to make Israel numerous (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>) and foreshadows their eventual settlement in Canaan.<p><b>Now come and put a curse on them for me</b><br>Balak, the king of Moab, seeks to employ Balaam, a diviner, to curse the Israelites. In the ancient Near East, blessings and curses were believed to have real power, often invoked by deities or through intermediaries. This reflects the spiritual warfare aspect of Israel's journey, as they face opposition not only physically but also spiritually. The request for a curse highlights the fear and desperation of Moab in the face of Israel's advance.<p><b>Perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them away</b><br>Balak's hope is that a curse will weaken the Israelites, making them vulnerable to military defeat. This reflects the common belief in the power of spoken words and divine intervention in battles. Historically, the Moabites were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>), and their fear of Israel's God-driven success underscores the tension between Israel and its neighbors. This also prefigures the spiritual battles believers face, relying on God's strength rather than human means.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who is fearful of the Israelites and seeks to curse them through Balaam.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner who is summoned by Balak to curse the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who have come out of Egypt and are journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The region ruled by Balak, which is threatened by the presence of the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which the Israelites have been delivered, symbolizing their liberation and God's faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>Despite human intentions to harm, God protects His people and can turn curses into blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words_and_intentions.htm">The Power of Words and Intentions</a></b><br>Words have power, but God's will prevails.
