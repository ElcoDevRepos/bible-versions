The Levites, being the priestly tribe, did not receive a large contiguous territory like the other tribes. Instead, they were given cities scattered throughout Israel. This ensured their presence and priestly duties were accessible to all Israelites, facilitating worship and maintaining the spiritual health of the nation. This distribution also reflects the principle of communal responsibility for spiritual leadership.<p><b>should be given to the Levites</b><br>The Levites were set apart for religious duties, serving in the Tabernacle and later the Temple. They were not to engage in typical agricultural or commercial activities, so they required support from the other tribes. This arrangement underscores the importance of spiritual service and the community's role in sustaining those dedicated to it. The Levites' role as mediators between God and the people prefigures the mediating work of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest.<p><b>in proportion to the inheritance of each tribe</b><br>This phrase indicates a fair and equitable distribution based on the size and resources of each tribe. Larger tribes were expected to provide more cities, while smaller tribes provided fewer. This principle of proportionality ensured that the burden of supporting the Levites was shared according to each tribe's capacity. It reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and fairness, as seen in the New Testament teaching of giving according to one's means (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-12.htm">2 Corinthians 8:12-14</a>).<p><b>more from a larger tribe and less from a smaller one.</b><br>This final phrase reiterates the principle of proportionality and fairness. It acknowledges the varying capacities of the tribes and ensures that the support of the Levites does not become an undue burden on any single tribe. This system of distribution also highlights the unity and interdependence of the tribes, as they collectively support the spiritual leadership of the nation. This mirrors the New Testament concept of the body of Christ, where each member contributes according to their gifts and abilities (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart for religious duties and service to God.

The arrangement protects equity, ensures continual teaching and sacrificial service among the nation, and underscores that God Himself is Israel&#8217;s true inheritance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the cities which ye shall give shall be,</span> etc. Rather, "And as to the cities which ye shall give from the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall multiply, and from the few ye shall decrease." What seems to be a general rule of proportionate giving is laid down here, but it was not carried out, and it is not easy to see how it could have been. From the large combined territory of Judah and Simeon nine cities were indeed surrendered (<a href="/joshua/21.htm">Joshua 21</a>), but all the rest, great and small, gave up four apiece, except Naphtali, which gave up three only. As the territory of Naphtali was apparently large in proportion to its numbers, this was probably for no other reason than that the tribe stood last on the list. Every one. Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. It was in fact each tribe that surrendered so many cities, but since the tribal inheritance was the joint property of all the tribesmen, every man felt that he was a party to the gift. No doubt it was the Divine intention to foster in the tribes as far as possible this local feeling of interest and property in the Levites who dwelt among them (compare the expression "their scribes and Pharisees" in <a href="/luke/5-30.htm">Luke 5:30</a>). The dispersion of the Levites (however mysteriously connected with the prophecy of <a href="/genesis/49-5.htm">Genesis 49:5-7</a>) was obviously designed to form a bond of unity for all Israel by diffusing the knowledge and love of the national religion, and by keeping up a constant communication between the future capital and all the provinces. According to the Divine ideal Israel as a whole was "the election" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>) from all the earth, the Levites were the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> of Israel, and the priests the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> of Levi. The priestly family was at present too small to be influential, but the Levites were numerous enough to have leavened the whole nation if they had walked worthy of their calling. They were gathered together in towns of their own, partly no doubt in order to avoid disputes, but partly that they might have a better opportunity of setting forth the true ideal of what Jewish life should be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/35-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The cities</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1462;&#1469;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;he&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
