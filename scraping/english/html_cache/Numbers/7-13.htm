The silver platter, a significant and valuable item, symbolizes the wealth and dedication of the giver. The weight of 130 shekels, using the sanctuary shekel, indicates a standardized measure used in the tabernacle, ensuring fairness and consistency. This offering reflects the importance of giving one's best to God, a principle seen throughout Scripture, such as in the offerings of Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>) and the widow's mite (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>).<p><b>and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels</b><br>The silver bowl, weighing seventy shekels, complements the platter, emphasizing the completeness and sufficiency of the offering. The use of silver, a precious metal, signifies purity and redemption, themes prevalent in biblical symbolism.

The fine flour represents the best of one's labor, while the oil signifies the Holy Spirit's presence and anointing. This offering points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>) and was anointed by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).
