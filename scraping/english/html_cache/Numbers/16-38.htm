The rebellion is detailed in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>, where these men challenged the God-ordained leadership. Their sin was not just against Moses and Aaron but against God Himself, resulting in their death as divine judgment. The phrase "at the cost of their own lives" underscores the severity of their rebellion and the holiness of God, who does not tolerate insubordination against His established order.<p><b>hammer them into sheets to overlay the altar</b><br>The censers, made of bronze, were to be hammered into sheets to overlay the altar. This act served a dual purpose: it was a practical use of the metal and a symbolic act of redemption. The altar, central to Israelite worship, was a place of sacrifice and atonement. By overlaying it with the censers, the Israelites were reminded of the consequences of rebellion and the need for atonement. This transformation from instruments of sin to a covering for the altar signifies God's ability to redeem and repurpose even the results of sin for His glory.<p><b>for these were presented before the LORD, and so have become holy</b><br>The censers, though used in rebellion, were presented before the LORD, which consecrated them. In biblical terms, anything presented to God becomes holy, set apart for His purposes. This reflects the principle that God can sanctify what is offered to Him, even if initially used in sin. The holiness of the censers after being presented to God serves as a reminder of His sovereignty and the sanctity of worship.<p><b>They will serve as a sign to the Israelites.</b><br>The transformed censers were to serve as a perpetual sign to the Israelites. This sign was a warning against rebellion and a reminder of the consequences of challenging God's appointed leaders. It also pointed to the importance of obedience and reverence in worship. In a broader biblical context, signs often serve to remind God's people of His laws and covenants, as seen with the rainbow in <a href="/genesis/9-13.htm">Genesis 9:13</a> and the Passover in <a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>.

The altar of burnt-offering had already a covering of brass; but, as the altar was made of wood, an additional covering afforded further security against the fire which was continually burning on it. The censers of Korah and his company were made of brass (<a href="/numbers/16-39.htm" title="And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, with which they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:">Numbers 16:39</a>). Those of Aaron and his sons are thought by some to have been made of silver, but there seems to be no sufficient authority for this supposition; and in <a href="/exodus/38-3.htm" title="And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, and the meat hooks, and the fire pans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass.">Exodus 38:3</a>, where the same Hebrew word is used, but which in the English version is rendered "firepans," it is said that all the vessels of the altar were made of brass. In the time of Solomon the censers were made of gold (<a href="/1_kings/7-50.htm" title="And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.">1Kings 7:50</a>). That used by Aaron on the great day of atonement was of gold. (Comp. <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm" title="Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;">Hebrews 9:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.">Revelation 8:3</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These sinners</span> <span class="cmt_word">against their own souls,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, "against their own lives."
