The use of poles for carrying the Ark of the Covenant and other sacred items (<a href="/exodus/25-13.htm">Exodus 25:13-15</a>) reflects the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the need for His people to approach Him with reverence and awe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kohathites.htm">The Kohathites</a></b><br>A Levitical family responsible for the care of the most sacred objects of the tabernacle, including the altar and its utensils.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, central to their worship and community life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>A sacred structure used for sacrifices and offerings, symbolizing atonement and communion with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Leaders of the Israelites, who received and communicated God's instructions regarding the tabernacle and its service.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_journey.htm">The Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The context in which these instructions were given, as the Israelites traveled from Egypt to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_sacred_duties.htm">Reverence for Sacred Duties</a></b><br>The meticulous care in handling the altar and its utensils underscores the importance of reverence in our service to God.
