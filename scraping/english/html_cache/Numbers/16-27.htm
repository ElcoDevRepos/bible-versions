The context is a rebellion against Moses and Aaron's leadership, which is seen as a challenge to God's appointed order. The act of moving away signifies a separation from sin and rebellion, a theme echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>, which calls believers to separate from unrighteousness. The dwellings of these men were likely tents, as the Israelites were still in the wilderness, emphasizing the transient nature of their rebellion against God's eternal plan.<p><b>Meanwhile, Dathan and Abiram had come out and stood at the entrances to their tents</b><br>Dathan and Abiram's action of standing at the entrances of their tents can be seen as a defiant posture, symbolizing their open rebellion and lack of repentance. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the entrance of a tent or house was a place of significance, often used for judgment or important announcements. Their presence at the entrance indicates their readiness to confront Moses and their unwillingness to submit to God's authority. This defiance is reminiscent of other biblical figures who stood against God's chosen leaders, such as Saul's rebellion against David.<p><b>with their wives and children and infants.</b><br>The inclusion of their families highlights the communal aspect of sin and its consequences. In the ancient world, the actions of the head of a household often affected the entire family, as seen in the story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>. This phrase underscores the seriousness of rebellion against God, as it not only impacts the individual but also those around them. It serves as a sobering reminder of the generational impact of sin and the importance of leading one's family in righteousness, as emphasized in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah.htm">Korah</a></b><br>A Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, challenging their leadership and the priesthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dathan_and_abiram.htm">Dathan and Abiram</a></b><br>Reubenites who joined Korah in his rebellion, questioning Moses' leadership and God's chosen order.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dwellings.htm">The Dwellings</a></b><br>The tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, which became the focal point of God's impending judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_congregation.htm">The Congregation</a></b><br>The Israelites who were instructed to distance themselves from the rebels to avoid sharing in their punishment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rebellion.htm">The Rebellion</a></b><br>A significant event where Korah, Dathan, and Abiram opposed Moses, leading to divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_rebellion.htm">The Danger of Rebellion</a></b><br>Rebellion against God&#8217;s appointed leaders is ultimately rebellion against God Himself.

The congregation&#8217;s quick response models obedience that takes God at His word without delay.<p>&#8211; Stepping back safeguarded them from being swept into judgment. The same principle runs through Scripture: God calls His people to separate from rebellion so they can be preserved (<a href="/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p>&#8211; We can trust this happened exactly as recorded. The literal distance they put between themselves and the rebels pictures the spiritual distance believers must keep from persistent sin (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Meanwhile, Dathan and Abiram had come out</b><p>&#8211; Earlier they refused Moses&#8217; invitation to dialogue (<a href="/numbers/16-12.htm">Numbers 16:12&#8211;14</a>). Now they come out, not to repent, but to posture defiantly.<p>&#8211; Their action illustrates <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, &#8220;Pride goes before destruction.&#8221; They step forward just as God&#8217;s judgment is about to fall, a chilling reminder that unchecked arrogance blinds a person to imminent danger (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8211; Their public appearance also shows how sin loves an audience; yet the witness they stage will become a testimony to God&#8217;s righteousness (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and stood at the entrances to their tents</b><p>&#8211; The doorway was the family&#8217;s place of greeting and decision (<a href="/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-9.htm">Deuteronomy 6:9</a>). By standing there, they signal ownership and security&#8212;as though the ground under their feet is unassailable.<p>&#8211; Their stance echoes the self-righteous posture Jesus later exposed in the Pharisee who &#8220;stood and prayed about himself&#8221; (<a href="/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11</a>). It is a picture of people anchoring confidence in their own house instead of the Lord (<a href="/matthew/7-26.htm">Matthew 7:26&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8211; God will soon open the earth beneath those very thresholds, proving that no human fortification can shield against divine verdict (<a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with their wives and children and infants</b><p>&#8211; Whole households are present.

While personal accountability remains true (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>), leaders&#8217; choices ripple out to loved ones (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8211; The scene underscores the sober reality that rebellion endangers the innocent, urging parents to walk humbly so their children enjoy blessing, not judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19&#8211;20</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/16-27.htm">Numbers 16:27</a> records two contrasting movements: the congregation quickly distances itself from rebellion, while Dathan and Abiram parade their defiance at their own doorsteps, families in tow.
