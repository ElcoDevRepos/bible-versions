This reflects the historical context of Moses' role as a prophet and leader during the Exodus. His leadership was divinely appointed, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>, where God calls Moses to lead His people out of Egypt. The Israelites' declaration to Moses indicates their recognition of his authority and their dependence on him for guidance and intercession.<p><b>&#8220;Look, we are perishing!</b><br>This phrase reflects the Israelites' fear and desperation. It is reminiscent of other instances in the wilderness where the Israelites expressed fear of death, such as in <a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2-3</a>, when they feared dying in the wilderness. The use of "perishing" indicates a sense of impending doom, often associated with divine judgment. This fear can be linked to the recent events in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>, where Korah's rebellion led to severe consequences, reinforcing the seriousness of disobedience to God's commands.<p><b>We are lost;</b><br>The expression of being "lost" signifies a feeling of hopelessness and confusion. In the wilderness, the Israelites frequently felt lost both physically and spiritually. This sentiment is echoed in <a href="/psalms/107-4.htm">Psalm 107:4-5</a>, where the psalmist describes wandering in the desert wastelands. Theologically, being "lost" can also symbolize a state of separation from God, highlighting the need for divine guidance and redemption.<p><b>We are all lost!&#8221;</b><br>The repetition emphasizes the collective despair of the community. It underscores the unity of the Israelites in their plight, as well as their shared responsibility and consequences for their actions. This communal aspect is significant in the context of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the actions of individuals could impact the entire community, as seen in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a> with Achan's sin. Theologically, this can also point to the universal need for salvation, fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who came to "seek and to save the lost" (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

After witnessing Korah&#8217;s rebellion and the plague that followed (<a href="/numbers/16-41.htm">Numbers 16:41-49</a>), the nation finally accepts that Moses is the God-given go-between, much like they had once begged him to stand between them and the fiery mountain (<a href="/exodus/20-19.htm">Exodus 20:19</a>). The scene reinforces a consistent biblical pattern: when sinful people recognize divine judgment, they look for a mediator&#8212;foreshadowing the greater Mediator to come (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Look, we are perishing!</b><p>The cry is immediate and emotional. Having seen 14,700 fellow Israelites fall under the plague only a day earlier (<a href="/numbers/16-49.htm">Numbers 16:49</a>), they now believe the same fate is upon them. Their words echo earlier panic moments&#8212;&#8220;Why have you brought us into this desert to die?&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>)&#8212;but this time their fear is grounded in a newly awakened respect for God&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;perishing&#8221; underscores a real, physical threat, not mere exaggeration.<p>&#8226; It also hints at eternal consequences; without atonement, sin ultimately leads to death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We are lost</b><p>Here the tone shifts from physical fear to spiritual despair. They sense they have crossed a line and cannot undo it. Isaiah felt something similar when he cried, &#8220;Woe to me! For I am ruined&#8221; in the presence of holy God (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). Recognition of lostness is the first step toward repentance (<a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>).<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s presence is life-giving, yet lethal to unrepentant sin (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Awareness of being &#8220;lost&#8221; highlights the need for God&#8217;s provision rather than human effort (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We are all lost!</b><p>The repetition broadens the confession from individual panic to national guilt. No one is exempt; every tribe, every household stands condemned (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). Yet <a href="/bsb/numbers/17.htm">Numbers 17</a> has just revealed God&#8217;s remedy: Aaron&#8217;s budding rod, preserved as &#8220;a sign for the rebellious&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/17-10.htm">Numbers 17:10</a>). The same God who exposes universal guilt also provides a singular way of grace, anticipating the once-for-all priesthood of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-27</a>).<p>Practical reflections:<p>&#8226; Corporate sin requires a corporate solution&#8212;an appointed priestly mediator.<p>&#8226; Seeing ourselves as &#8220;all lost&#8221; keeps pride in check and fosters humble dependence (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/17-12.htm">Numbers 17:12</a> captures Israel&#8217;s sudden realization of God&#8217;s uncompromising holiness and their own helplessness. Their triple cry&#8212;&#8220;we are perishing&#8230; we are lost&#8230; we are all lost&#8221;&#8212;confesses physical danger, spiritual ruin, and collective guilt. Yet the context also highlights God&#8217;s gracious provision through His chosen priest, pointing forward to Jesus, the ultimate Mediator and High Priest who rescues those who know they cannot rescue themselves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12, 13) <span class= "bld">And the children of Israel spake unto Moses . . . --</span>The special manifestations of Divine power which the Israelites had witnessed excited within them salutary emotions of awe and of anxious apprehension, but do not seem to have awakened within them any corresponding sense of gratitude either for their deliverance from the plague, or for the privileges which they enjoyed by reason of the Divine presence amongst them. The true answer to their inquiry whether they were doomed utterly to perish is contained in the following chapter, in which the priesthood of Christ is typically set forth as bearing the iniquity of the sanctuary, and thus making reconciliation for the sins and securing the acceptance of the imperfect service of His people.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Israel spake unto Moses.</span> It is a mistake to <span class="accented">unite</span> these verses specially with the following chapter, for they clearly belong to the story of Korah's rebellion, although not particularly connected with the miracle of the rod.
