The holiness of God is a central theme in the Old Testament, and the Israelites were repeatedly reminded of the need for reverence and obedience to God's commands. The Levitical laws were given to ensure that the Israelites could approach God without incurring His wrath. This reflects the broader biblical principle that sin leads to death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>), and only through God's provision can life be preserved.<p><b>when they come near the most holy things</b><br>The "most holy things" refer to the sacred objects within the Tabernacle, such as the Ark of the Covenant, the Table of Showbread, and the Altar of Incense. These items were considered extremely sacred because they were associated with God's presence. The Levites, specifically the Kohathites, were tasked with transporting these items, but they were not allowed to touch or see them uncovered, highlighting the separation between God&#8217;s holiness and human sinfulness.<p><b>do this for them:</b><br>This directive indicates a protective measure instituted by God. It shows God's mercy and provision for His people, ensuring that they could serve Him without facing the consequences of their inherent unworthiness. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of God providing a way for humanity to approach Him, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is our mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>Aaron and his sons are to go in</b><br>Aaron and his sons, the priests, had the unique role of mediating between God and the people. They were the only ones permitted to enter the Holy Place and perform the necessary rituals to cover the sacred items before the Levites transported them. This priestly role foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who intercedes on behalf of believers (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>and assign each man his task</b><br>This phrase emphasizes order and structure within the service of the Tabernacle. Each Levite had a specific role, ensuring that the work was done efficiently and reverently. This reflects the New Testament teaching on the body of Christ, where each member has a unique function (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>and what he is to carry</b><br>The specific assignments for carrying the holy items ensured that the Levites did not inadvertently touch or mishandle them, which would result in death. This careful attention to detail highlights the importance of obedience to God's commands. It also points to the burden of the law, which Christ ultimately fulfilled, allowing believers to approach God with confidence (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, brother of Moses, and a key figure in the Levitical priesthood.
