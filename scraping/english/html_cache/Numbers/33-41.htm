This event marked a transition in leadership and a reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God, as Aaron was not allowed to enter the Promised Land due to his role in the incident at Meribah. The departure from Mount Hor signifies the continuation of the Israelites' journey towards the Promised Land, emphasizing the theme of perseverance and faith in God's promises. Geographically, Mount Hor is traditionally identified with Jebel Harun in modern-day Jordan, highlighting the Israelites' route through the Transjordan region.<p><b>and camped at Zalmonah.</b><br>Zalmonah is one of the lesser-known stops in the Israelites' wilderness journey. Its exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the region of Edom, south of the Dead Sea. The name Zalmonah may be derived from a root meaning "shady" or "dark," possibly indicating a place of refuge or rest. This stop is part of the larger narrative of the Israelites' 40-year journey through the wilderness, a period of testing and reliance on God's provision. The journey from Mount Hor to Zalmonah reflects the ongoing movement of the Israelites under divine guidance, as they follow the cloud by day and the fire by night, symbolizing God's presence with His people. This journey can also be seen as a type of the Christian life, where believers are called to trust in God's leading through the wilderness of this world towards the ultimate Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_hor.htm">Mount Hor</a></b><br>A significant location in the Israelites' wilderness journey.
