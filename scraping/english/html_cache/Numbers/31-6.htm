This action follows God's command to avenge the Israelites against the Midianites for their role in leading Israel into idolatry and immorality (Numbers 25). The selection of a thousand men from each tribe signifies a unified effort from the entire nation, emphasizing the collective responsibility and participation of Israel in executing divine justice. This also reflects the structured and organized nature of Israelite society, where each tribe had a role in national endeavors.<p><b>along with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest</b><br>Phinehas, known for his zealous act in stopping a plague among the Israelites by executing an Israelite man and a Midianite woman (<a href="/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7-8</a>), is chosen to accompany the army. His presence signifies the spiritual dimension of the battle, highlighting that this is not merely a military campaign but a divine mission. Phinehas represents the priestly authority and the presence of God among the people, ensuring that the actions taken are in accordance with divine will.<p><b>who took with him the vessels of the sanctuary</b><br>The vessels of the sanctuary likely include sacred objects used in worship and rituals, symbolizing God's presence and blessing upon the military endeavor. Their inclusion underscores the sanctity of the mission and the need for divine favor and guidance. This act parallels the carrying of the Ark of the Covenant in other battles, where God's presence was invoked for victory (<a href="/joshua/6-6.htm">Joshua 6:6-7</a>).<p><b>and the trumpets for signaling</b><br>The trumpets, used for communication and signaling during battle, also have a ceremonial role in Israelite worship (<a href="/numbers/10-9.htm">Numbers 10:9-10</a>). They serve as a reminder of God's commands and promises, and their sound would rally the troops and instill confidence. The use of trumpets in battle is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing divine intervention and the proclamation of God's sovereignty (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

It does not appear whether the ark did or did not accompany the expedition. It has been inferred from <a href="/numbers/14-44.htm" title="But they presumed to go up to the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.">Numbers 14:44</a> that the reference may be to the ark, but it does not appear probable that the ark would be so described. Moreover, Phinehas was not the high priest, and therefore would not have the ephod with the breastplate, which was worn at this time by-Eleazar. The reference may be only to the silver trumpets (see <a href="/numbers/10-9.htm" title="And if you go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresses you, then you shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and you shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.">Numbers 10:9</a>), or it may include other sacred instruments. This was emphatically a holy war; and we may learn, from the command given to the Israelites to take with them "the holy instruments," that they who would engage in the war against sin and Satan must "take to them the whole armour of God" (<a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm" title="Why take to you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.">Ephesians 6:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Phinehas the son of Eleazar.</span> The high priest himself could not leave the camp and the sanctuary, because of his duties, and because of the risk of being defiled (see verse 19); but his son, who was already marked out as his successor, could act as his representative (see on Numbers 16:37). In after times the Messiah Milchama ("Sacerdos unctus ad bellum," alluded to in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-2.htm">Deuteronomy 20:2</a>) who accompanied the army to the field was a recognized member of the Jewish hierarchy.

The word instruments (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) is the same more usually translated "vessel," as in <a href="/numbers/3-31.htm">Numbers 3:31</a>, and is apparently to be understood of the sacred furniture of the tabernacle. It is difficult to understand what "holy vessels" could have accompanied an expedition of this sort, unless it were the ark itself. The Israelites were accustomed at all critical times to be preceded by the ark (<a href="/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>; <a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-8.htm">Joshua 6:8</a>), and the narrative of <a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a> sq. shows plainly that, long after the settlement at Shiloh, no scruples existed against bringing it forth against the foes of Israel and of God. Indeed there is a resemblance in the circumstances between that ease and this which is all the more striking because of the contrast in the result. Most modern commentators, unwilling to believe that the ark left the camp (but cf. <a href="/numbers/14-44.htm">Numbers 14:44</a>), identify the "holy instruments" with "the trumpets;" this, however, is plainly to do violence to the grammar, which is perfectly simple, and is contrary to the Septuagint and the Targums. The Targum of Palestine paraphrases "holy instruments" by Urim and Thummim; these, however, as far as we can gather, seem to have been in the exclusive possession of the high priest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/31-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
