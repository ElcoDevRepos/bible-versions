The fear of Moab is rooted in the recent victories of the Israelites over the Amorites, as recorded in the preceding chapters. This fear is not just a military concern but also a spiritual one, as the Moabites were aware of the divine favor upon Israel. The terror of Moab reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to make Israel a formidable nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>).<p><b>because they were numerous.</b><br>The Israelites' large numbers were a sign of God's blessing and fulfillment of His promise to Abraham to make his descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). This numerical strength was intimidating to surrounding nations, who saw it as a potential threat to their own security and resources. The census in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1 and 26</a> highlights the vast population of Israel, emphasizing their growth during the wilderness period.<p><b>Indeed, Moab dreaded the Israelites.</b><br>The dread of Moab is not merely a fear of military defeat but also an existential threat to their way of life and religious practices. The Moabites worshiped Chemosh, and the presence of a monotheistic people with a powerful God challenged their beliefs. This dread foreshadows the spiritual battles that Israel would face in maintaining their covenant identity amidst pagan nations. The Moabites' fear also sets the stage for the subsequent narrative involving Balaam, where spiritual warfare is waged through curses and blessings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation descended from Lot, located east of the Dead Sea.

Moab watches a vast nation set up camp &#8220;on the plains of Moab&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1</a>) and instantly senses its own vulnerability.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently notes how Israel&#8217;s size unsettled surrounding nations. Pharaoh once said, &#8220;Look, the people of the children of Israel are more numerous and stronger than we are&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/1-9.htm">Exodus 1:9-10</a>), an echo of the same fear.<p>&#8226; God had promised Abraham, &#8220;I will make you into a great nation&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>), and that promise is now visible&#8212;so sizable that a kingdom trembles.<p>&#8226; This moment fulfills God&#8217;s word to Moses: &#8220;Today I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the nations under the whole heaven, so that they will tremble when they hear of you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>).<p>&#8226; For Moab, numbers meant a looming threat of invasion, resource loss, and cultural displacement. Instead of turning to the Lord, Moab responds with panic, mirroring the reaction in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9</a> where Rahab recounts, &#8220;I know that the LORD has given you this land and that the terror of you has fallen on us.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Indeed, Moab dreaded the Israelites</b><p><a href="/numbers/22-3.htm">Numbers 22:3</a>b continues, &#8220;Indeed, Moab dreaded the Israelites.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The wording escalates from fear to dread&#8212;an emotional paralysis. <a href="/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a> speaks of such divine-induced dread: &#8220;Terror and dread fall upon them; by the greatness of Your arm they are still as stone.&#8221; The same hand of God stirs Moab&#8217;s heart.<p>&#8226; Dread reveals Moab&#8217;s recognition that Israel&#8217;s success is supernatural. Balak later admits, &#8220;This people will lick up everything around us&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4</a>), acknowledging a force beyond mere military might.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s victories came while relying on God, not superior weaponry (see <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>). Their presence testifies that the LORD fights for them, intensifying Moab&#8217;s anxiety.<p>&#8226; Instead of seeking reconciliation, Moab hires Balaam to curse Israel (<a href="/numbers/22-5.htm">Numbers 22:5-6</a>). This reaction highlights a broader biblical theme: opposition that refuses to bow before God ultimately furthers His purposes, as when Pharaoh&#8217;s hardness displayed God&#8217;s power (<a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/22-3.htm">Numbers 22:3</a> shows that Israel&#8217;s sheer size and God-given success triggered Moab&#8217;s terror and dread. The verse demonstrates God&#8217;s faithfulness to enlarge Abraham&#8217;s descendants and to place fear of them upon neighboring nations. Moab&#8217;s response&#8212;panic leading to spiritual hostility&#8212;contrasts with faith that could have sought blessing through Israel&#8217;s God. In the unfolding narrative, this fear will move Moab to enlist Balaam, yet even attempted curses will turn into blessings, confirming that no enemy plot can overturn the Lord&#8217;s promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And Moab was sore afraid of the people.--</span>There was no ground for this apprehension, inasmuch as the Divine command given to Moses was "Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle" (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>). It does not appear, however, that Balak was aware of the prohibition; and the recent conquests of the Israelites naturally filled the Moabites with alarm, especially inasmuch as when the Israelites sent to the King of Moab to ask permission to pass through his land he did not consent (<a href="/judges/11-17.htm" title="Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray you, pass through your land: but the king of Edom would not listen thereto.

But after the sudden defeat and overthrow of their own Amorite conquerors, their terror and uneasiness forced them to take some action, although they dared not commence open hostilities. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/22-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and Moab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1436;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4124.htm">Strong's 4124: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moab -- a son of Lot,also his descendants and the territory where they settled</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was terrified</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1490;&#1464;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7713;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
