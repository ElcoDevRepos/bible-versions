These tribes requested to settle on the east side of the Jordan River because the land was suitable for their large herds and flocks (<a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32:1-5</a>). Their decision reflects a practical choice based on economic needs, but it also sets a precedent for living outside the Promised Land's traditional boundaries. This choice required a commitment to assist the other tribes in conquering Canaan (<a href="/numbers/32-16.htm">Numbers 32:16-22</a>).<p><b>have received their inheritance</b><br>The concept of inheritance is central to the Israelites' understanding of the Promised Land. It signifies a divine allotment, a gift from God to His people, fulfilling His promises to the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 15</a>:18-21). The inheritance is not just a physical possession but a spiritual legacy, symbolizing God's faithfulness and the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>across the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River serves as a significant geographical and symbolic boundary in the biblical narrative. Crossing the Jordan represents entering into the promises of God, as seen in the later crossing led by Joshua (Joshua 3-4). For the two and a half tribes, settling "across the Jordan" indicates a separation from the main body of Israel, which could lead to future tensions and challenges in maintaining unity and faithfulness to God (Joshua 22).<p><b>from Jericho</b><br>Jericho is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world and holds a strategic position near the Jordan River. It is famously known for its conquest by Joshua and the Israelites, where the walls fell after the Israelites marched around them for seven days (Joshua 6). Jericho's mention here situates the eastern tribes' inheritance in a context of significant historical and military importance.<p><b>toward the sunrise</b><br>This phrase indicates the direction of the land allocation, eastward. In biblical symbolism, the east often represents beginnings and new opportunities, as the sun rises in the east. It can also imply a movement away from the central place of worship and community, which was west of the Jordan. This geographical orientation might suggest both the potential for new growth and the risk of isolation from the rest of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_two_and_a_half_tribes.htm">The Two and a Half Tribes</a></b><br>Refers to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
