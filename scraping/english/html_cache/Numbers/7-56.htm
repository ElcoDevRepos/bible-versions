The use of gold signifies value and purity, reflecting the preciousness of the offering to God. Gold was a common material used in the tabernacle, symbolizing divine presence and holiness (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>). The dish, or bowl, was likely used in the tabernacle service, emphasizing the importance of worship and sacrifice in Israelite culture.<p><b>weighing ten shekels</b><br>The weight of ten shekels indicates a specific and significant measure, showing the precision and care in offerings to God. A shekel was a standard unit of weight in ancient Israel, approximately 11.4 grams. This precision underscores the importance of following God's instructions exactly, as seen throughout the Pentateuch, where obedience to God's commands is a central theme.<p><b>filled with incense</b><br>Incense in the Bible often symbolizes prayer and the presence of God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>). The use of incense in the tabernacle was a daily ritual, representing the prayers of the people ascending to God. The specific mention of incense here highlights the role of the priesthood in mediating between God and the people, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus Christ as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The fragrance of incense also signifies the pleasing aroma of a life dedicated to God, as seen in the sacrificial system.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is overseeing the dedication offerings for the altar.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The central place of worship and sacrifice in the Tabernacle, being dedicated by the leaders of the tribes of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_benjamin.htm">Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>The tribe whose leader, Abidan son of Gideoni, is making the offering on the twelfth day.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/abidan_son_of_gideoni.htm">Abidan son of Gideoni</a></b><br>The leader of the tribe of Benjamin, who presents the offering.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_dedication.htm">The Importance of Dedication</a></b><br>The dedication of the altar signifies the importance of setting apart sacred spaces and times for worship.
