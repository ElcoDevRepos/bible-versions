In the context of <a href="/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18</a>, God is establishing the rights and responsibilities of the Levitical priesthood. The meat from certain sacrifices, such as peace offerings, was given to the priests as part of their sustenance. This provision underscores the principle that those who serve at the altar should receive their livelihood from the altar (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>). It reflects the broader biblical theme of God providing for those who dedicate their lives to His service.<p><b>just as the breast and right thigh of the wave offering belong to you</b><br>The wave offering was a specific type of sacrifice where parts of the animal were waved before the Lord as a symbolic gesture of presenting it to Him. The breast and right thigh were then given to the priests. This practice is detailed in <a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30-34</a>, where the wave offering is described as a perpetual statute for the Israelites. The breast and right thigh were considered choice portions, signifying honor and provision for the priests. This allocation also prefigures the New Testament teaching of Christ as our High Priest, who provides for His people. The wave offering, with its elements of dedication and provision, can be seen as a type of Christ's sacrificial work, where He offers Himself and provides spiritual sustenance to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>The primary recipients of the instructions in <a href="/bsb/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18</a>, Aaron and his sons were appointed as priests to serve in the tabernacle, responsible for the sacred duties and offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The broader community of God's chosen people, who were commanded to bring offerings and sacrifices to the tabernacle as part of their covenant relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites during their wilderness journey, where the priests performed their duties.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wave_offering.htm">Wave Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of offering presented before the Lord, symbolizing the dedication of the offering to God and His service.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levitical_priesthood.htm">The Levitical Priesthood</a></b><br>The tribe of Levi, set apart for the service of the tabernacle, with Aaron and his descendants serving as priests.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_for_his_servants.htm">God's Provision for His Servants</a></b><br>God ensures that those who serve Him are provided for, as seen in the allocation of offerings to the priests.

Either the law as prescribed in Numbers was subsequently modified, or the second clause of this verse explains and qualifies the preceding clause, and assigns only the wave breast and the right shoulder (or, rather, <span class= "ital">leg</span>) to the priests. (Comp. <a href="/context/leviticus/10-14.htm" title="And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall you eat in a clean place; you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they be your due, and your sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.">Leviticus 10:14-15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The flesh</span> <span class="cmt_word">of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are</span> thine.

Two explanations have been proposed. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the firstlings were given to the priest in the same sense as the peace offerings, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, only as regarded the breast and shoulder, while the rest went to the offerer. This, however, does obvious violence to the language, and is not supported by the Septuagint. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That as the priest was bound to consume the firstlings with his family, and could not sell them, he would be certainly disposed to invite the offerer to join him in the sacred meal. This may have <span class="accented">been</span> usually the case, but it was entirely within the option of the priest, and could scarcely be made the basis of a direct command, <span class="accented">like</span> that of <a href="/deuteronomy/15-19.htm">Deuteronomy 15:19</a>, still less of an indirect assumption, like that of <a href="/deuteronomy/12-17.htm">Deuteronomy 12:17, 18</a>, that the firstlings stood upon the same footing as free-will offerings and heave offerings.
