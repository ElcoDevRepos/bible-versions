The captives here likely include both people and livestock taken from the Midianites. This division is part of the broader instructions given by God to Moses after the Israelites' victory over the Midianites. The concept of dividing spoils is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>, where David establishes a precedent for sharing the spoils of war equally among those who fought and those who stayed behind.<p><b>between the troops who went out to battle</b><br>The troops mentioned here are the 12,000 Israelite soldiers who were specifically chosen to fight against the Midianites. This selection of warriors is significant, as it represents a small, divinely appointed force that achieved victory through God's guidance. The division of spoils among these troops underscores the principle of rewarding those who actively participate in the battle, a theme that resonates with the New Testament teaching of rewards for faithful service (<a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7-8</a>).<p><b>and the rest of the congregation.</b><br>The rest of the congregation refers to the remaining Israelites who did not participate directly in the battle. This inclusion highlights the communal nature of the Israelite society, where the benefits of victory were shared among all, not just the warriors. It reflects the unity and collective responsibility of the people of God, a concept echoed in the New Testament with the body of Christ, where each member is important and shares in the blessings of the whole (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).

Numbers 31:27 Mean</div><b>Then divide</b><p>The first word, &#8220;Then,&#8221; links this directive to the victory God had just granted over Midian (<a href="/numbers/31-1.htm">Numbers 31:1&#8211;24</a>). Moses is acting on God&#8217;s express command, not a human impulse. Division is presented as an act of obedience, echoing earlier passages where God sets patterns for distribution (<a href="/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16-18</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-20</a>).<p>&#8226; This underscores that God remains Lord over wartime gains, just as over manna or tithes.<p>&#8226; The community learns that every blessing, even booty from battle, is to be handled under divine instruction&#8212;never by personal whim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The captives</b><p>The word &#8220;captives&#8221; reminds us that the spoils included people as well as livestock and goods (<a href="/numbers/31-9.htm">Numbers 31:9, 35</a>). Their fate is not left to chance. <a href="/deuteronomy/20-14.htm">Deuteronomy 20:14</a> had already laid out guidelines: &#8220;You may take the women, children, livestock, and everything else&#8230; and enjoy the spoil of your enemies that the LORD your God has given you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law insists that captives become part of Israel&#8217;s stewardship, not objects for abuse.<p>&#8226; The instruction safeguards against soldiers claiming everything for themselves, reflecting the principle seen later when Saul&#8217;s army was restrained from selfish plunder (<a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Between the troops who went out to battle</b><p>Those who risked their lives receive a distinct share. This anticipates David&#8217;s ruling centuries later: &#8220;The share of the one who remains with the supplies shall be the same as the share of the one who went down to the battle&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Fair reward for faithful service affirms God&#8217;s justice (<a href="/proverbs/21-15.htm">Proverbs 21:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Recognition of the warriors&#8217; sacrifice keeps morale high and honors God-ordained roles (<a href="/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3-4</a> draws a spiritual parallel for believers today).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the rest of the congregation</b><p>The whole nation benefits, even those who stayed in camp. In <a href="/joshua/22-8.htm">Joshua 22:8</a>, the returning tribes are told, &#8220;Share the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This provision prevents division within the community; nobody is excluded from God&#8217;s blessings (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>).<p>&#8226; It reinforces unity: victory belonged to the LORD and therefore to all His people, not merely an elite few (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a> shows the same body principle).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/31-27.htm">Numbers 31:27</a> teaches that victory and its rewards come from the LORD, so distribution must follow His just pattern. Captives and spoils are divided under God&#8217;s direction, giving soldiers their due while blessing the entire covenant community. The verse models obedience, fairness, and unity&#8212;principles still vital for God&#8217;s people today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">And divide the prey into two parts . . . --</span>It was reasonable that those who had encountered the perils and hardships of the war should receive a larger share of the spoil than those who had remained in the camp. It was equally reasonable that the latter should not be left without some substantial benefit from the victory miraculously achieved over the enemies of the Lord and of His people. A similar direction is found in <a href="/joshua/22-8.htm" title="And he spoke to them, saying, Return with much riches to your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.">Joshua 22:8</a> in regard to the division of spoil taken from enemies, but no general ordinance appears to have been made in regard to the division of the spoils of war until the time of David.
