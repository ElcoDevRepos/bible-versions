The tribe's territory, located in the northern part of Canaan, was fertile and included parts of the coastal plain, which contributed to its wealth. The clans of Asher were significant in the Israelite community, contributing to the military and social structure of the nation.<p><b>and their registration numbered 53,400</b><br>This census, taken in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, was the second census of the Israelites, the first being recorded in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>.

The number 53,400 indicates a slight increase from the previous census, where Asher had 41,500 men (<a href="/numbers/1-41.htm">Numbers 1:41</a>). This growth reflects God's blessing and the tribe's faithfulness. The census also served to organize the community for military purposes, as only men aged 20 and above were counted. The increase in numbers can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham to make his descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asher.htm">Asher</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, whose descendants formed one of the tribes of Israel.
