In the context of <a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>, these women were part of a strategy to seduce the Israelites into idolatry and immorality. The use of "these women" highlights their direct involvement and culpability in the events that transpired. This incident underscores the recurring biblical theme of the dangers of intermingling with pagan cultures, which often led Israel away from their covenant with God.<p><b>through the counsel of Balaam</b><br>Balaam was a prophet who, despite being unable to curse Israel directly, advised Balak, the king of Moab, on how to weaken Israel by enticing them into sin. This counsel is detailed in <a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a> and is further elaborated in <a href="/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>, which mentions Balaam's teaching as a stumbling block to the Israelites. Balaam's actions serve as a warning against using spiritual gifts for personal gain and the consequences of leading others into sin.<p><b>to turn unfaithfully against the LORD at Peor</b><br>The location, Peor, is significant as it was a site where the Israelites engaged in idolatry and immorality with the Moabites, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>. This turning away from God is a recurring theme in Israel's history, illustrating the constant struggle between faithfulness to God and the temptation of surrounding pagan practices. The phrase "turn unfaithfully" indicates a breach of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, emphasizing the seriousness of their actions.<p><b>so that the plague struck the congregation of the LORD</b><br>The plague was a direct consequence of Israel's unfaithfulness, serving as divine judgment for their sins. This event is a reminder of the holiness of God and the seriousness of sin, particularly idolatry and immorality. The "congregation of the LORD" refers to the entire community of Israel, highlighting that the sin of some can have repercussions for the whole community. This incident foreshadows the need for a mediator, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity to reconcile them with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who, despite being used by God to bless Israel, advised the Moabites to lead Israel into sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were led astray into idolatry and immorality at Peor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/peor_incident.htm">Peor Incident</a></b><br>A significant event where the Israelites were seduced into worshiping Baal of Peor, leading to a divine plague.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moabites.htm">Moabites</a></b><br>The people who, under Balaam's counsel, enticed the Israelites into sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plague.htm">Plague</a></b><br>A divine punishment that struck the Israelites as a consequence of their unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Balaam's advice led to a compromise of Israel's faith, showing how small concessions can lead to significant spiritual downfall.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_unfaithfulness.htm">The Consequences of Unfaithfulness</a></b><br>The plague that struck Israel serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_spiritual_vigilance.htm">The Importance of Spiritual Vigilance</a></b><br>Believers must remain vigilant against influences that lead them away from God, just as the Israelites were led astray.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_call_to_holiness.htm">God's Call to Holiness</a></b><br>The incident at Peor underscores God's call for His people to live holy and separate lives, avoiding the enticements of the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>Despite their failure, the Israelites were given opportunities to repent and be restored, illustrating God's mercy and grace.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_31_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 31:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_31_16_Disobedience_s_outcome.htm">How does Numbers 31:16 illustrate the consequences of disobedience to God's commands?
