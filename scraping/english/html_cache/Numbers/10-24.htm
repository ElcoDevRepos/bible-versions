In the context of Numbers, leaders like Abidan were chosen to represent their tribes, indicating a structured and organized community. This reflects the importance of family and tribal leadership in Israelite society. The name Gideoni, meaning "hewer" or "one who cuts down," may suggest a family known for strength or leadership qualities. The role of Abidan as a leader is significant in maintaining order and unity among the Israelites during their journey to the Promised Land.<p><b>was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin</b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, named after Jacob's youngest son, held a unique position among the tribes of Israel. Known for their warrior skills, the Benjamites were often involved in significant battles throughout Israel's history. The division of the tribe refers to the military and organizational structure necessary for the Israelites' journey and eventual conquest of Canaan. This structure ensured that each tribe had a clear role and responsibility, contributing to the overall success of the nation. The tribe of Benjamin later became notable for producing Israel's first king, Saul, and for its association with the Apostle Paul in the New Testament. The leadership of Abidan over the division highlights the tribe's readiness and capability to fulfill its role in the larger community of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elishama_son_of_ammihud.htm">Elishama son of Ammihud</a></b><br>Elishama is identified as the leader of the tribe of Ephraim during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness.
