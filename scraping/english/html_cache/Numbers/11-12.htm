This rhetorical question highlights Moses' human limitations and the overwhelming nature of his leadership role. It reflects the common biblical theme of leaders feeling inadequate for their God-given tasks, similar to Jeremiah's reluctance (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>) and Gideon's hesitance (<a href="/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a>).<p><b>Did I give them birth,</b><br>Moses uses maternal imagery to emphasize his lack of responsibility for the Israelites' existence. This metaphor underscores the intimate and nurturing role expected of him, which he feels unqualified to fulfill. The use of birth imagery is significant in the Bible, often symbolizing new beginnings and God's creative power, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> and the birth of Isaac in <a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21</a>.<p><b>so that You should tell me,</b><br>Moses is addressing God directly, indicating a personal and candid relationship. This phrase shows Moses' boldness in prayer, a model for believers to approach God with honesty and transparency. It echoes other instances where biblical figures question God, such as Job (<a href="/job/13-3.htm">Job 13:3</a>) and Habakkuk (<a href="/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2-3</a>).<p><b>&#8216;Carry them in your bosom,</b><br>The imagery of carrying in the bosom suggests tender care and protection, akin to a shepherd with his sheep (<a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>). This phrase reflects God's expectation for Moses to lead with compassion and patience. It also foreshadows Christ's role as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), who carries and cares for His flock.<p><b>as a nurse carries an infant,&#8217;</b><br>The comparison to a nurse carrying an infant highlights the nurturing and sustaining role Moses is expected to play. In ancient cultures, nurses were trusted caregivers, emphasizing the depth of responsibility. This imagery parallels Paul's description of his ministry in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a>, where he likens his care for the church to a nursing mother.<p><b>to the land that You swore to give their fathers?</b><br>This phrase references the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised the land of Canaan to Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 15</a>:18-21). It underscores the faithfulness of God to His promises despite human frailty. The land promise is a central theme in the Pentateuch and is fulfilled in part through Joshua's conquests (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-45</a>). It also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who secures an eternal inheritance for believers (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

They are often depicted as grumbling and complaining, which adds to Moses' burden.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting for this event, representing a place of testing and reliance on God. It is a physical and spiritual journey for the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land God swore to give to the forefathers of the Israelites.

Like Moses, leaders may feel overwhelmed and inadequate. It is important to seek God's guidance and strength in these times.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Moses' cry to God reflects a deep dependence on divine help. Believers are encouraged to rely on God for strength and wisdom, especially when facing overwhelming tasks.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/shared_responsibility.htm">Shared Responsibility</a></b><br>Just as Moses needed to share the burden of leadership, we are reminded of the importance of community and delegation. In the body of Christ, we are called to support one another.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite the challenges, God remains faithful to His promises.
