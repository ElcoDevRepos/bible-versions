This phrase indicates that the woman is under her father's authority, reflecting the patriarchal structure of the time. The concept of a woman being in her father's house signifies her dependence and the protection she receives from her family. This context is crucial for understanding the legal and social dynamics at play, as women were often considered under the guardianship of their fathers until marriage. This is similar to the cultural practices seen in <a href="/genesis/24.htm">Genesis 24</a>, where Rebekah is under her family's authority until her marriage to Isaac.<p><b>makes a vow to the LORD</b><br>Vows were solemn promises made to God, often involving a commitment to perform a specific act or to abstain from certain activities. In the biblical context, vows were taken very seriously, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>, which warns against making vows lightly. The act of making a vow to the LORD indicates a personal and spiritual commitment, reflecting the individual's relationship with God. This practice underscores the importance of integrity and faithfulness in one's spiritual life, as vows were considered binding and sacred.<p><b>or obligates herself by a pledge</b><br>A pledge, similar to a vow, involves a commitment or promise, often with a specific condition or action attached. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, pledges could involve various forms of dedication, such as offerings or acts of service. The distinction between a vow and a pledge may lie in the nature or scope of the commitment. This phrase highlights the seriousness with which personal commitments were regarded, emphasizing the need for careful consideration before making such promises. The concept of pledges can be seen in other parts of Scripture, such as in the story of Hannah in <a href="/1_samuel/1.htm">1 Samuel 1</a>, where she pledges her son Samuel to the LORD's service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/y/young_woman.htm">Young Woman</a></b><br>Refers to a female who is still under the authority of her father, indicating her unmarried status and her position within the family structure.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/father's_house.htm">Father's House</a></b><br>Represents the household where the young woman resides, under the authority and protection of her father, which was a common cultural setting in ancient Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vow_to_the_lord.htm">Vow to the LORD</a></b><br>A solemn promise or commitment made to God, which was a serious and binding act in the Israelite community.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/obligates_herself_by_a_pledge.htm">Obligates Herself by a Pledge</a></b><br>Indicates a personal commitment or promise that the young woman makes, which could involve various forms of dedication or service.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_authority_and_responsibility.htm">Understanding Authority and Responsibility</a></b><br>The passage highlights the role of authority within the family structure, emphasizing the father's responsibility in overseeing vows made by his daughter.

The sanctity and obligations of the fifth commandment are distinctly recognised and enforced in these verses. (See <a href="/context/matthew/15-4.htm" title="For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and mother: and, He that curses father or mother, let him die the death.">Matthew 15:4-5</a>.) Whenever the vow which the young daughter had made should come to the ears of her father, he had the power either to ratify or to disannul it. If he remained silent the vow was ratified; if he disallowed the vow, the obligation to fulfil it no longer remained in force.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a woman vow a vow.</span> The fragmentary nature of this section appears from the fact that, after laying down the general principle of the sacredness of vows, it proceeds to qualify it in three special cases only of vows made by women under authority.
