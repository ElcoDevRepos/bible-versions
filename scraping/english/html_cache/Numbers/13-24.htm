The cluster of grapes signifies the land's fertility and abundance, fulfilling God's promise of a land "flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). Grapes were a staple in the ancient Near Eastern diet, used for food and wine, symbolizing prosperity and blessing. The act of cutting the grapes indicates the tangible evidence of God's provision and the land's richness, which was meant to encourage the Israelites to trust in God's promises.<p><b>that place was called the Valley of Eshcol</b><br>"Eshcol" means "cluster" in Hebrew, directly referencing the significant cluster of grapes found there. Naming places after events or characteristics was common in biblical times, serving as a memorial for God's acts and the experiences of His people. The Valley of Eshcol is located near Hebron, a significant city in biblical history, associated with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This naming also serves as a reminder of the Israelites' journey and the challenges they faced in trusting God's promises.

The spies had just reached Canaan&#8217;s hill country and &#8220;cut a branch with a single cluster of grapes&#8221; so large that &#8220;they carried it on a pole between two men&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/13-23.htm">Numbers 13:23</a>).<p>&#8226; This abundant fruit was a visible, tangible confirmation of God&#8217;s earlier promise that the land would be &#8220;flowing with milk and honey&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The overwhelming size of the grapes underscored God&#8217;s generosity, reminding Israel that His blessings are never meager (<a href="/psalms/81-10.htm">Psalm 81:10</a>; <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The cluster became a symbol: what God says, He supplies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Israelites cut there</b><p>&#8226; The phrase centers on Israel&#8217;s personal involvement&#8212;these weren&#8217;t rumors; the people themselves gathered the evidence (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-22.htm">Deuteronomy 1:22-25</a>).<p>&#8226; By cutting the fruit, the spies acted in obedience to Moses&#8217; instructions to &#8220;see what the land is like&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Their firsthand experience left the nation without excuse&#8212;God had shown His faithfulness in concrete form (<a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-19</a>).<p>&#8226; It also illustrates a pattern: God invites His people to participate in the unfolding of His promises (<a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1-24</a>; 6:23).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that place was called</b><p>&#8226; Naming places after God&#8217;s acts turns moments into memorials (<a href="/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>; <a href="/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Here, the new name fixed the event in Israel&#8217;s collective memory so future generations could recall both the blessing and the ensuing choice between faith and fear (<a href="/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Such memorial names invite worship and witness, pointing back to what the Lord has done (<a href="/joshua/4-7.htm">Joshua 4:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Valley of Eshcol</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Eshcol&#8221; means &#8220;cluster,&#8221; so the valley&#8217;s title permanently testified to the land&#8217;s fruitfulness (<a href="/numbers/32-9.htm">Numbers 32:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-24.htm">Deuteronomy 1:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The same region appears earlier in Genesis when Abram&#8217;s allies included an Amorite named Eshcol (<a href="/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>); God&#8217;s unfolding story revisits familiar ground to highlight continuity in His plans.<p>&#8226; The valley sits near Hebron&#8212;an area rich in patriarchal history&#8212;linking the spies&#8217; report to God&#8217;s covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Ironically, the valley that showcased promise also became the backdrop for Israel&#8217;s doubt, reminding us that evidence alone cannot substitute for faith (<a href="/numbers/14-1.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/13-24.htm">Numbers 13:24</a> records more than a note about geography; it captures a moment when God&#8217;s lavish provision lay heavy across a pole on the shoulders of His people. The cluster of grapes proved His word, the act of cutting it involved Israel in His promise, the naming preserved the memory, and the Valley of Eshcol stood as a lasting monument to both God&#8217;s generosity and the need for wholehearted trust.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">The place was called . . . --</span>This verse states the reason why the valley was so called by the Israelites, but does not determine the question whether it originally derived its name from Eshcol or not.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster. It</span> is very probable that it was already known as the valley of Eshcol, from the friend of Abraham, who bore that name and lived in that neighbourhood (<a href="/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13, 24</a>). If so it is an admirable instance of the loose way in which etymologies are treated in the Old Testament: what the place really received was not a new name, but a new signification to the old name; but this appeared all one in the eyes of the sacred writer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/13-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Because of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1434;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the cluster</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#353;&#183;k&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
