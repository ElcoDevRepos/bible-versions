This area was significant as it was the final encampment of the Israelites before crossing into the Promised Land. The name "Shittim" refers to the acacia trees that were abundant in the region. This location is crucial in the narrative of Israel's journey, marking a period of transition and testing before entering Canaan. The Israelites' stay here is a reminder of their proximity to the fulfillment of God's promises, yet also highlights their vulnerability to temptation and sin.<p><b>the men began to indulge in sexual immorality</b><br>The phrase indicates a moral and spiritual decline among the Israelites. The Hebrew term used here suggests not just a physical act but a turning away from covenant faithfulness to God. This immorality was not merely a personal failing but a communal sin that threatened the holiness and distinctiveness of the Israelite community. The act of indulging in sexual immorality is often linked in Scripture to idolatry, as seen in other passages like <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a> with the golden calf incident. This behavior reflects a broader pattern of rebellion and disobedience that plagued Israel throughout their wilderness journey.<p><b>with the daughters of Moab</b><br>The Moabites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, and had a complicated relationship with Israel. The interaction with the Moabite women was not just a matter of personal relationships but had significant religious implications. The Moabites worshiped the god Chemosh, and their religious practices often included ritual prostitution and other forms of sexual immorality. By engaging with the Moabite women, the Israelite men were not only breaking God's commandments regarding sexual purity but were also at risk of being drawn into idolatry. This incident foreshadows later events where Israel's alliances with foreign nations lead to spiritual compromise, as seen in the accounts of Solomon and the divided kingdom. The narrative serves as a warning against the dangers of syncretism and the importance of maintaining covenant faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, consisting of the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Temptation often strikes hardest on the threshold of blessing.<p>&#8226; The people had already heard Balaam bless them (<a href="/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9-10</a>), so any lapse now would be unmistakably disobedient.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the men began to indulge</b><p>The verse marks a conscious choice, not a momentary slip:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Began&#8221; hints at a progressive surrender of will, echoing how Eve &#8220;saw that the tree was good&#8230;and took&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture warns believers to &#8220;make no provision for the flesh&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>).
