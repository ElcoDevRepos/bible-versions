This encounter emphasizes God's direct intervention in human affairs. Balaam, a non-Israelite prophet, is being addressed by God, highlighting God's sovereignty over all nations and peoples. This moment is pivotal as it shows God's control over the situation, despite Balaam's initial intentions to curse Israel.<p><b>&#8220;Go with the men</b><br>God permits Balaam to accompany Balak's messengers, indicating His allowance of human free will within divine sovereignty. This permission is a test of Balaam's obedience to God's command. The men refer to the Moabite officials sent by Balak, king of Moab, who feared the Israelites due to their numbers and victories. This reflects the historical tension between Israel and surrounding nations.<p><b>but you are to speak only what I tell you.&#8221;</b><br>This command underscores the importance of prophetic integrity and obedience to God's word. Balaam is reminded that his prophetic gift is subject to God's authority. This mirrors the biblical theme that true prophecy comes from God alone, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-22</a>, where God promises to raise a prophet who will speak His words.<p><b>So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</b><br>Balaam's compliance indicates his acknowledgment of God's authority, yet his later actions reveal a struggle between obedience and personal gain. The "princes of Balak" were high-ranking officials, showing the seriousness of Balak's request. This journey sets the stage for the subsequent oracles, where Balaam blesses Israel instead of cursing them, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a> that those who bless Israel will be blessed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner who is summoned by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse the Israelites.

Like Elijah&#8217;s angelic encounter (<a href="/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5&#8211;7</a>), this shows God&#8217;s direct involvement in guiding&#8212;even restraining&#8212;His servants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go with the men</b><p>&#8226;

(Comp. <a href="/numbers/22-20.htm" title="And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men come to call you, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say to you, that shall you do.">Numbers 22:20</a>, where God Himself is represented as delivering to Balaam the same injunction.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go with the men.</span> It may be asked to what purpose the angel appeared, if Balaam was to proceed just the same. The answer is that the angel was not a warning, but a destroying, angel, a visible embodiment of the anger of God which burnt against Beldam for his perversity. The angel would have slain Balaam, as the lion slew the disobedient prophet, but that God in his mercy permitted the fidelity and wisdom of the ass to save her master from the immediate consequences of his folly. If Balaam had had a mind capable of instruction, he would indeed have gone on as he was bidden, but in a very different spirit and with very different designs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/22-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the Angel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1448;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;&#8217;a&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4397.htm">Strong's 4397: </a> </span><span class="str2">A messenger, of God, an angel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
