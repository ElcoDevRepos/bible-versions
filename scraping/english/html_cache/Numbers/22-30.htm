It underscores God's sovereignty and ability to use any means to communicate His will. The donkey's speech is a divine intervention to prevent Balaam from cursing Israel, showing God's protection over His chosen people.<p><b>&#8220;Am I not the donkey you have ridden all your life until today?</b><br>This question emphasizes the long-standing relationship between Balaam and the donkey, suggesting trust and familiarity. It serves as a reminder of the donkey's consistent service and reliability, contrasting with Balaam's current irrational anger. This reflects the biblical theme of God using the humble and lowly to convey His messages, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>.<p><b>Have I ever treated you this way before?&#8221;</b><br>The donkey appeals to Balaam's reason by pointing out its consistent behavior. This rhetorical question is meant to make Balaam reflect on the unusual nature of the situation, prompting him to consider the possibility of divine intervention. It highlights the importance of discernment and awareness of God's workings in everyday life.<p><b>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied.</b><br>Balaam's response indicates his acknowledgment of the donkey's past faithfulness, yet he initially fails to see the spiritual significance of the event. This moment of realization is a turning point, leading to Balaam's eventual recognition of God's message. It serves as a reminder of the need for humility and openness to God's guidance, even through unexpected sources.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner who is known for his encounter with the angel of the Lord and his talking donkey. Balaam is a complex figure who is both sought after for his ability to curse and bless and is later condemned for leading Israel into sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_donkey.htm">The Donkey</a></b><br>Balaam's donkey, which miraculously speaks to him. This event is unique in Scripture and serves as a divine intervention to prevent Balaam from proceeding with his harmful intentions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_of_the_lord.htm">Angel of the Lord</a></b><br>A divine messenger who stands in the path of Balaam to oppose him. The angel's presence is initially unseen by Balaam but is visible to the donkey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The region where King Balak summons Balaam to curse the Israelites. Moab is significant as a place of opposition to Israel during their wilderness journey.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who fears the Israelites and seeks Balaam's help to curse them.

This is no parable; it is a literal event showing that the God who opened Balaam&#8217;s eyes (v. 31) can also open a donkey&#8217;s mouth.<p>- <a href="/2_peter/2-16.htm">2 Peter 2:16</a> later confirms this historical miracle, noting that &#8220;a speechless donkey &#8230; spoke with a man&#8217;s voice.&#8221;<p>- God has used unlikely messengers before&#8212;think of ravens feeding Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4&#8211;6</a>) or a rooster awakening Peter&#8217;s conscience (<a href="/luke/22-60.htm">Luke 22:60&#8211;61</a>). The point: when people refuse to hear, the Lord can enlist creation itself (<a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Am I not the donkey you have ridden all your life until today?</b><p>- The animal appeals to a lifetime of consistent service. Balaam had depended on this same beast &#8220;all your life,&#8221; yet he suddenly assumes it is in the wrong.<p>- This echoes <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>&#8212;&#8220;faithful are the wounds of a friend.&#8221; The donkey, though wounded by Balaam&#8217;s blows (v. 27), remains faithful.<p>- God often reminds us of past faithfulness so we will pause before rash decisions (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>). Reliable patterns in God&#8217;s provision should prompt trust, not frustration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Have I ever treated you this way before?</b><p>- A rhetorical question invites Balaam to consider evidence: the donkey has never behaved like this. Something unusual must be happening.<p>- Animals can perceive danger humans miss (<a href="/job/12-7.htm">Job 12:7&#8211;10</a>). Here, the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD blocking the path (vv. 23&#8211;26).<p>- The challenge mirrors God&#8217;s own appeals to Israel: &#8220;What injustice did your fathers find in Me?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>). When trusted servants break pattern, it may signal divine intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No, he replied.</b><p>- Balaam is forced to acknowledge the truth. His curt &#8220;No&#8221; admits that the donkey&#8217;s history is spotless.<p>- This admission cracks open Balaam&#8217;s pride, preparing him for the Angel&#8217;s rebuke (vv. 31&#8211;35). <a href="/proverbs/15-31.htm">Proverbs 15:31</a> notes, &#8220;He who listens to life-giving reproof will dwell among the wise.&#8221;<p>- Like David after Nathan&#8217;s &#8220;You are the man!&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), Balaam must confront his own blindness and repent of resisting God&#8217;s warning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/22-30.htm">Numbers 22:30</a> showcases God&#8217;s power to communicate through any means, even a humble donkey. The animal&#8217;s lifelong faithfulness, sudden unusual behavior, and pointed questions expose Balaam&#8217;s rashness and call him to humility. When the consistent becomes inconsistent, it may be the Lord arresting our path, urging us to open our eyes, listen, and realign with His will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">Ever since I was thine.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">ever since thou livedst,</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., all thy life long. </span>The Targums of Jonathan and of Jerusalem paraphrase thus--"upon which thou hast ridden from thy youth unto this day."
