In the context of <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>, these tribes had large herds and flocks and saw that the land of Jazer and Gilead was suitable for livestock. They approached Moses with a request to settle in this land east of the Jordan River, rather than crossing into Canaan. This response is part of their agreement to Moses' conditions for settling there. Historically, these tribes were known for their warrior capabilities, which is significant in their commitment to help the other tribes conquer Canaan before settling.<p><b>&#8220;As the LORD has spoken to your servants</b><br>This phrase indicates their acknowledgment of divine authority and their submission to God's will as communicated through Moses. It reflects the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where God&#8217;s commands were delivered through chosen leaders. The phrase also underscores the importance of obedience to God&#8217;s word, a recurring theme throughout the Pentateuch. The use of "servants" highlights their humility and readiness to serve God's purposes, aligning with the biblical principle of servanthood seen in figures like Moses and later, Jesus Christ.<p><b>so we will do.</b><br>This commitment to action demonstrates their willingness to fulfill their obligations and promises. It reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where obedience leads to blessing. The phrase echoes the broader biblical theme of faithfulness and the importance of following through on one's word, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which emphasizes being doers of the word. This commitment also prefigures the New Testament call to discipleship, where believers are called to act in accordance with Christ&#8217;s teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_gad_and_reuben.htm">Sons of Gad and Reuben</a></b><br>These are the tribes of Israel who requested to settle on the east side of the Jordan River, as the land was suitable for their livestock.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who mediated between God and the people, ensuring that the tribes' request aligned with God's will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whose commands and promises are central to the account.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant geographical boundary for the Israelites, representing the border of the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, symbolizing God's faithfulness and provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The response of the tribes of Gad and Reuben highlights the importance of obedience to God's directives.

Their reply shows an immediate, unified response, mirroring the earlier moment when &#8220;all the congregation answered and said, &#8216;We will do everything the LORD has spoken&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-8.htm">Exodus 19:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Their answer models responsible leadership: they speak for their households, just as Joshua later speaks for Israel, &#8220;As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As the LORD has spoken</b><p>&#8226; They root their commitment in divine, not merely human, authority. Moses&#8217; words carry weight precisely because they echo God&#8217;s voice (compare <a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience begins with listening: &#8220;Speak, for Your servant is listening&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; By pointing to what &#8220;the LORD has spoken,&#8221; they echo Israel&#8217;s foundational pledge: &#8220;We will do everything the LORD has said&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>).
