This appointment highlights the special role of the Levites in Israel's religious life, as they were responsible for the spiritual welfare of the nation. The "tabernacle of the Testimony" refers to the portable sanctuary that housed the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the tablets of the Law. This phrase underscores the sacred duty of the Levites to maintain the holiness and integrity of the place where God's presence dwelled among His people. The Levites' role foreshadows the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament, where every Christian is called to serve God and maintain the holiness of their spiritual life.<p><b>all its furnishings, and everything in it</b><br>The furnishings of the tabernacle included the altar, the lampstand, the table of showbread, and other sacred items used in worship. Each piece had specific instructions for its construction and use, as detailed in Exodus. The Levites' responsibility for these items signifies their role in facilitating the worship and sacrificial system that pointed to the coming of Christ, who would fulfill the Law and the Prophets. The meticulous care for these items reflects the importance of reverence and order in worship, a principle that continues in Christian worship practices today.<p><b>They shall carry the tabernacle and all its articles</b><br>The tabernacle was designed to be portable, allowing the Israelites to carry it as they journeyed through the wilderness. The Levites were tasked with the physical labor of transporting the tabernacle and its articles, which required careful attention to detail and adherence to God's instructions. This duty symbolizes the journey of faith and the need for God's presence to accompany His people wherever they go. It also prefigures the incarnation of Christ, who "tabernacled" among us, bringing God's presence into the world in a new and profound way.<p><b>care for it</b><br>The care of the tabernacle involved maintaining its sanctity and ensuring that all rituals and sacrifices were performed according to God's commands. This responsibility highlights the importance of purity and devotion in the service of God. The Levites' role as caretakers of the tabernacle serves as a reminder of the need for spiritual vigilance and dedication in the life of a believer. It also points to Christ, who is the ultimate caretaker of our souls, interceding on our behalf before the Father.<p><b>and camp around it</b><br>The Levites were to camp around the tabernacle, forming a protective barrier between the sacred space and the rest of the Israelite camp. This arrangement emphasized the holiness of the tabernacle and the need for separation from sin. It also illustrates the concept of God dwelling in the midst of His people, a theme that is fulfilled in the New Testament with the coming of the Holy Spirit to indwell believers. The Levites' encampment around the tabernacle serves as a type of the church, which is called to be a holy community set apart for God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service to God.
