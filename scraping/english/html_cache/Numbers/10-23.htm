His father, Pedahzur, is mentioned as a leader of the tribe of Manasseh, indicating a lineage of leadership. This reflects the importance of family heritage and tribal leadership in ancient Israel. The name Gamaliel is also associated with a prominent teacher in the New Testament, suggesting a continuity of respected leadership within Jewish tradition.<p><b>was over the division</b><br>The term "division" refers to the organized military and social structure of the Israelite camp. Each tribe was divided into groups for orderly movement and encampment. This organization was crucial for maintaining order among the large number of Israelites during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. It reflects the military-like precision required for their travels and battles, as seen in other parts of the Pentateuch.<p><b>of the tribe of Manasseh</b><br>Manasseh was one of the two sons of Joseph, and his tribe was one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The tribe of Manasseh was known for its significant size and strength, receiving a large portion of land on both sides of the Jordan River. This allocation of land is detailed in the book of Joshua. The tribe's role in the wilderness journey and later settlement in Canaan highlights the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs. Manasseh's position in the camp and their leadership under Gamaliel underscores their importance in the collective identity and mission of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are on their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence of God among the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_of_sinai.htm">Wilderness of Sinai</a></b><br>The desert region where the Israelites camped and received the law from God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cloud.htm">Cloud</a></b><br>Represents the presence and guidance of God, which led the Israelites on their journey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_guidance.htm">God's Guidance</a></b><br>Just as God guided the Israelites with a cloud, He provides guidance to us today through His Word and the Holy Spirit.

The repetition shows continuity: God&#8217;s order for His people does not shift with circumstances.<p>&#8211; Although the name later appears in <a href="/acts/5-34.htm">Acts 5:34 and 22</a>:3, that New-Testament figure is another man entirely. The overlap simply highlights how common it was to choose names proclaiming God&#8217;s greatness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>son of Pedahzur</b><p>&#8211; Scripture regularly names a man&#8217;s father to anchor him in a real family line (<a href="/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14-25</a>). This underscores that leadership is not self-generated; it flows outward from God&#8217;s covenant with households.<p>&#8211; Pedahzur, mentioned only in connection with Gamaliel (<a href="/numbers/1-10.htm">Numbers 1:10</a>; 2:20; 7:54, 59; 10:23), is otherwise unknown.

Even divided geographically, they remained one tribe&#8212;an early picture of God&#8217;s people spanning boundaries yet staying unified (<a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>).<p>&#8211; Manasseh often stands alongside Ephraim, his younger brother, revealing the grace-pattern of Scripture: birth order is secondary to God&#8217;s sovereign choice (<a href="/romans/9-11.htm">Romans 9:11-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/10-23.htm">Numbers 10:23</a> records a simple logistical detail&#8212;&#8220;and Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh&#8221;&#8212;yet it pulses with meaning. God appoints identifiable leaders rooted in real families, tasks them with caring oversight, and weaves each tribe&#8217;s uniqueness into a disciplined, worship-centered march. In Gamaliel we glimpse a faithful steward; in Manasseh, a people growing into God&#8217;s promise; in the orderly division, a preview of the church&#8217;s coordinated mission. The verse invites us to trust that the Lord still knows every name, assigns every role, and advances His redeemed community with purpose and precision.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/10-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Gamaliel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(gam&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1583.htm">Strong's 1583: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gamaliel -- a Manassite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Pedahzur</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6301.htm">Strong's 6301: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pedahzur -- 'the rock has ransomed', a Manassite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was over</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1448;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
