The use of oxen, which were valuable animals, signifies the importance and sincerity of the offering. Oxen were often used in sacrifices due to their size and value, symbolizing strength and service. This offering reflects the communal aspect of worship in Israel, where peace offerings were shared among the priests, the offerer, and God.<p><b>five rams</b><br>Rams were significant in sacrificial rituals, often symbolizing leadership and strength. The number five can represent grace or God's goodness in biblical numerology. Rams were used in various offerings, including burnt offerings, which were entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing complete dedication to God. The inclusion of rams in the peace offering highlights the completeness and richness of the offering.<p><b>five male goats</b><br>Goats were commonly used in sacrifices and were considered clean animals according to Levitical law. The male goat, or "he-goat," was often associated with sin offerings, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a> during the Day of Atonement. Here, their inclusion in the peace offering may symbolize the removal of sin and the restoration of fellowship with God. The number five again emphasizes grace and favor.<p><b>and five male lambs a year old</b><br>Lambs, especially those a year old, were frequently used in sacrifices due to their innocence and purity, often symbolizing Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God. The use of five lambs further underscores the theme of grace. The age of the lambs indicates they were in their prime, representing the best of what the offerer could give, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who was without blemish.<p><b>This was the offering of Pagiel son of Ocran.</b><br>Pagiel, a leader of the tribe of Asher, is mentioned here as the one presenting the offering. His name means "God allots" or "God meets," which may reflect the divine provision and blessing upon the tribe. The mention of his father, Ocran, situates Pagiel within his tribal lineage, emphasizing the communal and familial aspects of worship and offering. This offering was part of the dedication of the altar, where each tribal leader presented gifts, symbolizing unity and collective worship among the tribes of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The leader of the Israelites who received the offerings from the leaders of the tribes for the dedication of the altar.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_leaders.htm">Israelite Leaders</a></b><br>- The heads of the tribes who brought offerings for the dedication of the altar.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>- The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, where the offerings were brought.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>- The structure in the Tabernacle where sacrifices and offerings were made to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/dedication_of_the_altar.htm">Dedication of the Altar</a></b><br>- A significant event where offerings were made by the leaders of the tribes to consecrate the altar for worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_dedication.htm">The Importance of Dedication</a></b><br>Just as the altar was dedicated to God, we are called to dedicate our lives to His service.

By matching the offerings of other chiefs (<a href="/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12&#8211;88</a>), Pagiel shows egalitarian devotion&#8212;no tribe held back, fulfilling <a href="/deuteronomy/16-17.htm">Deuteronomy 16:17</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/7-77.htm">Numbers 7:77</a> records a specific portion of Pagiel&#8217;s offering: a peace-offering composed of two oxen, five rams, five male goats, and five year-old male lambs.
