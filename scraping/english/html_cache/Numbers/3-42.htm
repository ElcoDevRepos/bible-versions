This census is significant because it reflects the importance of the firstborn in Israelite culture, where the firstborn held a special status and were often dedicated to God. This act is a direct response to the events of the Exodus, where the firstborn of Egypt were struck down, and the firstborn of Israel were spared. The numbering signifies a dedication and a reminder of God's deliverance. The firstborn were considered to belong to God, and this census is a step in organizing the Levites as substitutes for the firstborn in service to God.<p><b>as the LORD had commanded him</b><br>This phrase underscores the obedience of Moses to God's direct command. It highlights the importance of divine instruction in the governance and religious practices of Israel. The command from the LORD is a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to God's word is paramount. This obedience is a recurring theme throughout the Pentateuch, emphasizing the need for faithfulness to God's commands. It also foreshadows the ultimate obedience of Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the will of the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Moses responds immediately to God&#8217;s directive, underscoring that faithful leadership begins with simple, practical obedience (<a href="/numbers/3-16.htm">Numbers 3:16</a>; 1:54).<p>&#8226; Counting is not mere administration; it recognizes each life as belonging to God (<a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier censuses (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2&#8211;3</a>) prepared Israel for warfare; this one prepares them for worship, highlighting that every part of life&#8212;military or spiritual&#8212;comes under divine order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the firstborn</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;All&#8221; reminds us there are no exceptions; every firstborn male, from every tribe, is under God&#8217;s claim (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>; 34:19).<p>&#8226; The firstborn represent the whole nation, pointing back to the night of the Passover when God spared Israel&#8217;s firstborn through the lamb&#8217;s blood (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Later, Christ is called &#8220;the firstborn over all creation&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>), the ultimate fulfillment of what the firstborn typified&#8212;belonging wholly to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the Israelites</b><p>&#8226;
