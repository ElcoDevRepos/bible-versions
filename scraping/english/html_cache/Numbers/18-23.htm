Their duties included maintaining the sacred space, assisting the priests, and ensuring the proper conduct of worship. This role was crucial for the spiritual life of Israel, as the Tent of Meeting was where God's presence dwelled among His people (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-38</a>). The Levites' service foreshadows the priesthood of all believers in Christ (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), who are called to serve God and maintain spiritual worship.<p><b>and they must bear their iniquity</b><br>The Levites were responsible for any transgressions related to their duties, highlighting the seriousness of their role. This concept of bearing iniquity is seen in the sacrificial system, where the priest bore the sins of the people (<a href="/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>). It points to the ultimate bearing of iniquity by Jesus Christ, who took upon Himself the sins of the world (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p><b>This is a permanent statute for the generations to come</b><br>The enduring nature of this command underscores the perpetual need for dedicated service to God. It reflects the unchanging nature of God's requirements for holiness and order in worship. This permanence is echoed in the New Covenant, where the principles of worship and service continue through the Church (<a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15-16</a>).<p><b>The Levites will not receive an inheritance among the Israelites</b><br>Unlike the other tribes, the Levites did not receive a portion of the land in Canaan (<a href="/joshua/13-33.htm">Joshua 13:33</a>). Their inheritance was the Lord Himself and the tithes and offerings of the people (<a href="/numbers/18-24.htm">Numbers 18:24</a>). This arrangement emphasizes reliance on God rather than material possessions, a principle echoed in the New Testament where believers are called to store up treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The Levites' unique position points to the spiritual inheritance believers have in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service in the Tent of Meeting.
