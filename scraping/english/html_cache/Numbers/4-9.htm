Blue is often associated with the heavens and the divine in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>, where the pavement under God's feet is described as sapphire stone. The color blue in the tabernacle's context symbolizes the holiness and separation of God's presence from the mundane.<p><b>and cover the lampstand used for light</b><br>The lampstand, or menorah, is a significant symbol in the tabernacle, representing the light of God's presence among His people. It is made of pure gold, as described in <a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-40</a>, and is a type of Christ, who is the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). Covering the lampstand with a blue cloth during transport underscores the sacredness of God's light and guidance.<p><b>together with its lamps, wick trimmers, and trays</b><br>These items are essential for the maintenance and function of the lampstand. The lamps provide the light, the wick trimmers ensure the light burns brightly, and the trays hold the necessary tools. This attention to detail reflects the care and reverence required in worship and service to God. The maintenance of the lampstand can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual vigilance and purity.<p><b>as well as the jars of oil with which to supply it</b><br>Oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>, where David is anointed with oil, and the Spirit of the Lord comes upon him. The oil for the lampstand signifies the continual presence and empowerment of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers. The need to supply the lampstand with oil highlights the necessity of being filled with the Spirit to shine God's light in the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kohathites.htm">The Kohathites</a></b><br>A Levitical family responsible for the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects, including the lampstand.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where the lampstand was located.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lampstand.htm">The Lampstand (Menorah)</a></b><br>A sacred object in the Tabernacle, symbolizing God's light and presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received instructions from God regarding the care of the Tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>Priests who were responsible for covering the sacred objects before the Kohathites transported them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_light.htm">Symbolism of Light</a></b><br>The lampstand represents God's guidance and presence.

Similar use of blue thread appears in the high priest&#8217;s robe (<a href="/exodus/28-31.htm">Exodus 28:31</a>) and in the tassels that remind Israel to obey God (<a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38&#8211;39</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail shows God&#8217;s concern for order and reverence; each covering is specified, leaving nothing to human preference (<a href="/exodus/39-32.htm">Exodus 39:32&#8211;33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and cover the lampstand used for light</b><p>&#8226; The lampstand, or menorah, was handcrafted of pure gold (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31&#8211;40</a>) and placed in the Holy Place to shine continually (<a href="/exodus/40-24.htm">Exodus 40:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; Covering it before transport guarded against damage and casual viewing, affirming that holy things remain holy even in transition (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6&#8211;7</a> illustrates the danger of irreverence).<p>&#8226; Jesus later identified Himself as &#8220;the Light of the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), echoing the menorah&#8217;s purpose of perpetual illumination.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>together with its lamps</b><p>&#8226; The seven individual lamps sat atop the branches (<a href="/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>); God requires every piece to travel with the stand so nothing is misplaced.<p>&#8226; Wholeness matters: the unity of the lamps mirrors the oneness of God&#8217;s people carrying out His worship (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>).<p>&#8226; This careful inventory foreshadows the New Testament call to keep every spiritual gift functioning so the church can shine brightly (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wick trimmers, and trays</b><p>&#8226; Wick trimmers (snuffers) kept the flame burning cleanly, while trays received the removed wick material (<a href="/exodus/25-38.htm">Exodus 25:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Maintenance tools are included because ongoing service requires constant attention, not occasional flair (<a href="/leviticus/24-3.htm">Leviticus 24:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; God values stewardship of both prominent and humble tasks, a truth echoed in <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>: &#8220;Whoever is faithful with very little will also be faithful with much&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as well as the jars of oil with which to supply it</b><p>&#8226; Pure olive oil fueled the lamps (<a href="/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20&#8211;21</a>).

The command underscores that divine light depends on divine supply.<p>&#8226; Practically, Israel&#8217;s obedience here ensures that worship can restart the moment the tabernacle is re-erected; spiritually, it reminds believers to remain filled with the Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/4-9.htm">Numbers 4:9</a> lays out precise, reverent steps for transporting the golden lampstand and every accessory that sustains its light. By commanding a blue covering, complete inventory, and guarded handling, God teaches His people that holy things must stay holy, light must never go out, and faithful service includes both the grand and the ordinary. The verse ultimately points to the unending, Spirit-supplied light God provides through His Son and through the ongoing, careful devotion of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Snuff-dishes.</span> Some render this word "extinguishers," but it could hardly bear that meaning, since it also signifies censers in chapter Numbers 16:6, and fire-pans in <a href="/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>.
