In biblical context, the earth opening is a rare occurrence, symbolizing divine judgment. It reflects God's sovereignty over creation, as seen in other instances where nature responds to His command, such as the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>). The imagery of the earth opening is also reminiscent of the final judgment, where the earth will give up its dead (<a href="/revelation/20-13.htm">Revelation 20:13</a>).<p><b>and swallowed them</b><br>The act of the earth swallowing the rebels is a vivid demonstration of God's immediate and severe judgment against sin and rebellion. This event serves as a warning to the Israelites and future generations about the consequences of defying God's appointed leaders. It parallels other instances of divine retribution, such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>). The swallowing is both literal and symbolic, indicating total and irreversible judgment.<p><b>and their households</b><br>The inclusion of households in the judgment highlights the communal nature of sin and its consequences. In ancient Near Eastern culture, families were often seen as a single unit, and the actions of one member could affect the entire household. This reflects the biblical principle that sin can have far-reaching effects beyond the individual, as seen in the story of Achan (<a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24-25</a>). It underscores the importance of collective responsibility and obedience to God.<p><b>all Korah&#8217;s men</b><br>Korah's men were part of the rebellion against Moses and Aaron, challenging their God-given authority. This rebellion is a significant event in Israel's history, illustrating the dangers of pride and ambition. Korah, a Levite, sought the priesthood, which was not his appointed role. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of respecting God's established order, as seen in the New Testament with the roles within the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>).<p><b>and all their possessions</b><br>The destruction of their possessions signifies the totality of God's judgment. In biblical times, possessions were often seen as a sign of God's blessing, and their loss indicated divine disfavor. This complete eradication serves as a stark reminder of the futility of earthly wealth and status when opposed to God's will. It echoes the teaching of Jesus about storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah.htm">Korah</a></b><br>A Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, challenging their leadership and the priesthood established by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dathan_and_abiram.htm">Dathan and Abiram</a></b><br>Along with Korah, they were leaders in the rebellion against Moses, representing the tribe of Reuben.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and the high priest, appointed by God to serve in the tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth_opening.htm">The Earth Opening</a></b><br>A miraculous event where the ground split apart and swallowed the rebels, serving as divine judgment against their rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_rebellion.htm">The Danger of Rebellion</a></b><br>Korah's account is a stark reminder of the consequences of rebelling against God's appointed leaders.

Living obediently under His appointed leadership safeguards us from similar ruin and keeps us in the place of blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">And the earth opened her mouth . . . --</span>Had this verse stood alone it might have been inferred that Korah and his family shared the fate of Dathan and Abiram and their families and households. in regard <span class= "ital">to </span>the sons of Korah, however, there is direct evidence that they did not share in the punishment of Dathan and Abiram (see Note on <a href="/numbers/16-27.htm" title="So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.">Numbers 16:27</a>): and in regard to Korah there is ground for the belief that he perished by fire with the 250 men who offered incense with him. It is true, indeed, that in <a href="/numbers/26-10.htm" title="And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign.">Numbers 26:10</a> Korah is mentioned in conjunction with Dathan and Abiram (see Note <span class= "ital">in loc.</span>)<span class= "ital">; </span>but in the other places in which reference is made to the conspiracy, the fate of the chief conspirators is separated. Thus, in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-6.htm" title="And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the middle of all Israel:">Deuteronomy 11:6</a> we read only of what God did unto Dathan and Abiram and their households and tents; and in <a href="/psalms/106-17.htm" title="The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.">Psalm 106:17</a> we read that "The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram," whilst in the following verse it is added that "The flame burned up the wicked." If Korah's tent remained in its appointed place amongst the Kohathites, it may reasonably be supposed that the chasm did not extend beyond the tents of Dathan and Abiram; or if Korah had pitched a tent for himself adjoining the tents of Dathan and Abiram, it may be inferred that those only of his household remained in it who shared in the conspiracy, and that his sons remained amongst the other Kohathites, or withdrew with the rest of the congregation at the command of Moses. It is most natural to suppose that Korah was at this time before the door of the Tabernacle, with the 250 men of his company who had presumed to offer incense, and that he shared their doom. Ibn Ezra observes that in the song of the Red Sea there is no mention made of the drowning of Pharaoh, but only of his chariots and hosts; whilst in <a href="/psalms/136-15.htm" title="But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endures for ever.">Psalm 136:15</a> we read that Pharaoh and his host were overthrown in the Red Sea.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And their houses,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, their families, as in <a href="/numbers/18-13.htm">Numbers 18:13</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And all</span> <span class="cmt_word">the men that appertained unto Korah.</span> Literally, "all the men who to Korah."
