This act signifies the dedication and consecration of the Levites for their sacred duties. The Levites were set apart for service in the tabernacle, emphasizing their role as intermediaries between God and the people. This presentation before the LORD underscores the importance of divine approval and blessing in their service.<p><b>as a wave offering from the sons of Israel</b><br>The wave offering was a ritual act where the offering was moved back and forth before the LORD, symbolizing its presentation to God. Although typically associated with grain or animal sacrifices, here it metaphorically represents the Levites themselves being offered. This act signifies the Levites' role as representatives of the entire nation, dedicated to God&#8217;s service. The wave offering highlights the communal aspect of their consecration, as they are given by the sons of Israel, indicating the collective responsibility and support of the community for the Levites' ministry.<p><b>so that they may perform the service of the LORD</b><br>The Levites were tasked with assisting the priests and maintaining the tabernacle, which was central to Israelite worship and religious life. Their service was essential for the proper functioning of the sacrificial system and the observance of the law. This phrase emphasizes the purpose of their consecration: to serve God and facilitate the worship of the community. The Levites' service foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers as a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), dedicated to serving God and each other.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

It may have been done by leading them backwards and forwards in front of the Tabernacle and in the presence of the people, or by the waving of Aaron's hands. The same word is used elsewhere in reference to offerings of different kinds--as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>of gold in <a href="/exodus/35-22.htm" title="And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold to the LORD.">Exodus 35:22</a>.

This injunction seems conclusive that the whole ceremonial was to be symbolically per. formed, for the Levites could not possibly be waved in any literal sense. Some have supposed that they were marched up and down before the altar, forgetting that the court would scarcely afford standing room for 1000 people, while the Levites between thirty and fifty numbered more than 8000. It is certain that the Levites could only be brought before the Lord, could only be waved (howsoever that was done), could only lay their hands upon the bullocks, by representation. If we suppose, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, that a hundred men of position and command among them entered the court as representatives of the tribe, then we can understand how the ceremonial here commanded might have been effectively carried out. <span class="cmt_word">That they may execute the service of the Lord.</span> Literally, "that they may be to execute the service of the Lord." Their being waved made them over in a figure to the Lord to be wholly his, and to live only for his service, and at his command. But just as wave offerings were assigned by Divine permission to the use of the priests, so were the Levites given to Aaron and his sons for ever. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/8-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Aaron</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1448;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_175.htm">Strong's 175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aaron -- an elder brother of Moses</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is to present</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1507;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#234;&#183;n&#238;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
