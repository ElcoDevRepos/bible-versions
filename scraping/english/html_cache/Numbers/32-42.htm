The act of capturing Kenath and its villages signifies the expansion of Israelite territory east of the Jordan River. Kenath is identified with the modern-day town of Qanawat in Syria, part of the region known as Bashan. This area was known for its fertile land and strategic importance. The capture of Kenath reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites land, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>. The conquest also demonstrates the Israelites' military prowess and God's favor in granting them victory over their enemies.<p><b>and called it Nobah, after his own name</b><br>Renaming a captured city was a common practice in ancient times, symbolizing dominion and control. By naming the city after himself, Nobah was asserting his authority and leaving a legacy. This act can be compared to other instances in the Bible where names are changed to reflect new beginnings or divine intervention, such as Abram to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>) or Jacob to Israel (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>). The renaming also highlights the personal ambition and influence of Nobah within the tribe of Manasseh. This act of naming can be seen as a type of Christ, who has the authority to give new names and identities to His followers, as seen in <a href="/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nobah.htm">Nobah</a></b><br>A leader from the tribe of Manasseh who captured the city of Kenath and renamed it after himself.

Like Caleb in <a href="/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>, Nobah steps out in faith while Israel is still east of the Jordan.<p>&#8226; The timing links back to verses 20-32, where Moses grants Reuben, Gad, and half-Manasseh permission to settle Gilead if they first help conquer Canaan (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/3-18.htm">Deuteronomy 3:18-20</a>). Nobah&#8217;s movement shows immediate obedience to that larger mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and captured Kenath and its villages</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and captured Kenath and its villages&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Kenath sat in Bashan, a region Moses had just taken from Og (<a href="/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33-35</a>).

Here the new name memorializes Nobah&#8217;s bold trust in God&#8217;s promise.<p>&#8226; This act also signals permanence: the land is no longer Amorite but incorporated into Israel&#8217;s inheritance, matching <a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a> where God vows fixed borders.<p>&#8226; Later records such as <a href="/1_chronicles/2-23.htm">1 Chronicles 2:23</a> recall Kenath&#8217;s capture, showing the endurance of that new name in Israel&#8217;s history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/32-42.htm">Numbers 32:42</a> shows one man&#8217;s faith translating promise into possession. Nobah acts, conquers what God has already allotted, and leaves a lasting imprint by renaming the city. The verse underlines personal initiative grounded in divine assurance, demonstrating how individual obedience advances the larger fulfillment of God&#8217;s covenant to Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nobah.</span> As this chieftain is nowhere else named, we may probably conclude that he was one of the companions of Jair, holding a position more or less subordinate to him. <span class="cmt_word">Kenath</span>. The modern Kenawat, on the western slope of the Jebel Hauran, the most easterly point ever occupied by the Israelites. It is apparently the Nobah mentioned in <a href="/judges/8-11.htm">Judges 8:11</a>, but it has reverted (like so many others) to its old name. In spite of the uncertainties which hang over the conquest of this north-eastern territory, there is something very characteristic in the part played by the Machirite leaders. That they acted with an independent vigour bordering on audacity, that they showed great personal prowess, and had great personal authority with the humbler members of their family, and held something like the position of feudal superiors among them, is evident from the way in which they are spoken cf. And this is quite in keeping with the character of the Manassites in after times. The "governors" who came at the call of Barak, Gideon, the greatest of the warrior-judges, and probably Jephthah also ("the Gileadite"), as well as the younger Jail maintained the warlike and impetuous character of their race. If "Elijah the Tishbite" was really from this region (although this is extremely doubtful), we should find in him the characteristic daring and self-reliance of Machir transmuted into their spiritual equivalents. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/32-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Nobah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1465;&#1443;&#1489;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7687;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
