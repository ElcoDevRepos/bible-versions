The tabernacle was a portable sanctuary, reflecting the transient nature of the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land. This mobility symbolizes God's presence with His people wherever they go, emphasizing His guidance and protection. The tabernacle's movement was directed by God, often signified by the cloud lifting from above it (<a href="/exodus/40-36.htm">Exodus 40:36-38</a>).<p><b>the Levites are to take it down</b><br>The Levites were set apart for the service of the tabernacle, a role that underscored their unique position among the tribes of Israel. They were responsible for the dismantling and transportation of the tabernacle, highlighting their dedication to the sacred duties assigned by God. This task required precision and reverence, as the tabernacle was the dwelling place of God's presence. The Levites' role foreshadows the priesthood of all believers, who are called to serve God with dedication and care (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>and whenever it is to be pitched</b><br>The reassembly of the tabernacle was equally important, requiring the Levites to follow specific instructions to ensure the sanctity and proper function of the sacred space. This process reflects the order and holiness that God demands in worship. The tabernacle's setup was a communal event, reminding the Israelites of their covenant relationship with God and their identity as His chosen people.<p><b>the Levites are to set it up</b><br>This reiteration of the Levites' responsibility emphasizes their exclusive role in handling the holy objects. It underscores the importance of obedience and the careful observance of God's commands. The Levites' service points to the greater High Priest, Jesus Christ, who mediates between God and humanity and establishes the ultimate place of worship in Himself (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<p><b>Any outsider who goes near it must be put to death</b><br>This severe warning highlights the holiness of the tabernacle and the seriousness of approaching God's presence without authorization. It underscores the concept of sacred space and the need for purity and reverence in worship. This restriction serves as a reminder of the separation between God and humanity due to sin, which is ultimately bridged by Jesus Christ, who grants believers access to God through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties, particularly concerning the tabernacle and later the temple.
