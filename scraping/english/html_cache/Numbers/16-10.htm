In the context of <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>, God had chosen the tribe of Levi to assist the priests in the tabernacle, signifying a privileged position of nearness to God. This nearness is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God draws certain individuals or groups closer for specific purposes, as seen with figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and the nation of Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>). The Levites' role was to maintain the holiness of the tabernacle, a precursor to the New Testament concept of believers being a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>you and all your fellow Levites</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the collective calling of the Levites, not just an individual appointment. The Levites were set apart from the other tribes of Israel to perform duties related to the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>). This collective calling reflects the communal nature of worship and service in ancient Israel, where the community played a central role in religious life. It also prefigures the New Testament church, where believers are called to serve together as one body (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>but you are seeking the priesthood as well</b><br>This phrase addresses the rebellion of Korah and his followers, who were Levites but not priests. They challenged the exclusive priesthood of Aaron and his descendants, seeking a role that God had not assigned to them. This rebellion is a significant event in Israel's history, illustrating the dangers of pride and discontent with God's ordained order. It serves as a warning against coveting positions of authority and highlights the importance of respecting God's appointments. The desire for the priesthood can be seen as a type of the broader human tendency to seek positions of power and recognition, contrasting with the humility exemplified by Jesus Christ, who did not grasp at equality with God but took on the form of a servant (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah.htm">Korah</a></b><br>A Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, questioning their leadership and the special role of the priesthood.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest, chosen by God to serve in the tabernacle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The tribe set apart for service to God, assisting the priests in the tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, where the Levites and priests served.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_choice.htm">God's Sovereign Choice</a></b><br>God chooses whom He wills for specific roles and responsibilities.
