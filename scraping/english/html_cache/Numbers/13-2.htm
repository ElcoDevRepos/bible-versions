The land of Canaan is significant as it is the Promised Land, a central theme in the narrative of the Israelites. Historically, Canaan was a region with diverse city-states and cultures, often associated with idolatry and pagan practices. The act of sending spies reflects a common ancient Near Eastern military strategy to assess the strength and resources of a land before invasion. This phrase also foreshadows the challenges and faith tests the Israelites will face.<p><b>which I am giving to the Israelites</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine promise and covenant God made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, affirming that the land is a gift from God to the descendants of Israel. It highlights God's sovereignty and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises. Theologically, this promise is a type of the ultimate rest and inheritance believers find in Christ, as referenced in <a href="/hebrews/4.htm">Hebrews 4</a>. The certainty of God's gift contrasts with the Israelites' later doubts and fears.<p><b>From each of their fathers&#8217; tribes send one man</b><br>The instruction to select one man from each tribe emphasizes the representative nature of the mission. It ensures that all tribes have a stake in the reconnaissance and subsequent report, promoting unity and shared responsibility. This tribal representation reflects the organizational structure of Israel, rooted in their patriarchal lineage. It also serves as a reminder of the twelve tribes' origin from the sons of Jacob, linking back to the patriarchal narratives in Genesis.<p><b>who is a leader among them</b><br>The selection of leaders indicates the importance and seriousness of the mission. These men were not only to gather intelligence but also to influence and guide their respective tribes based on their findings. Leadership in this context required wisdom, courage, and faith, qualities that would be tested in the subsequent narrative. This phrase also highlights the biblical theme of leadership accountability, as the leaders' report would significantly impact the faith and actions of the entire nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were promised the land of Canaan by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised by God to the Israelites, described as a land flowing with milk and honey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_twelve_spies.htm">The Twelve Spies</a></b><br>Representatives from each of the twelve tribes of Israel, tasked with scouting the land of Canaan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribes_of_israel.htm">The Tribes of Israel</a></b><br>The twelve tribes, each descending from one of the sons of Jacob, also known as Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_command.htm">Obedience to God's Command</a></b><br>God instructed Moses to send spies, demonstrating the importance of following divine guidance even when the path is uncertain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_responsibility.htm">Leadership and Responsibility</a></b><br>Each tribe sent a leader, emphasizing the role of leadership in carrying out God's plans and the responsibility leaders have to their people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>The mission to spy out Canaan was rooted in God's promise to give the land to Israel, reminding believers to trust in God's promises despite challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_and_strategy.htm">Preparation and Strategy</a></b><br>The reconnaissance mission shows the value of preparation and strategic planning in fulfilling God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_unity.htm">Community and Unity</a></b><br>The involvement of all twelve tribes underscores the importance of unity and collective effort in achieving God's objectives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_13_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 13:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_send_spies_to_Canaan.htm">Why did God command Moses to send spies into the land of Canaan?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Num_13_2_show_God_s_promise.htm">How does Numbers 13:2 demonstrate God's promise to the Israelites?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_obedience_from_Canaan_spies.htm">What can we learn about obedience from the spies' mission in Canaan?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Numbers_13_2_to_Abraham_s_covenant.htm">How does Numbers 13:2 connect to God's covenant with Abraham in Genesis?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Using_divine_guidance_daily_3.htm">How can we apply the concept of divine guidance in our daily decisions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_send_spies_to_Canaan_2.htm">Why did God command Moses to send spies into Canaan in Numbers 13:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_13_2_God_s_promise_to_Israel.htm">How does Numbers 13:2 reflect God's promise to the Israelites?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_the_land_in_Numbers_13_2_important.htm">What is the significance of the land God promised in Numbers 13:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_numbers_13.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Numbers 13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_there_work_in_heaven.htm">What is the identity of the Kenizzites?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_is_the_tribe_of_manasseh_important.htm">What is the significance of the Tribe of Manasseh?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_tribe_of_ephraim.htm">What is the Tribe of Ephraim?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/who_are_the_calebites_in_the_bible.htm">Who are the Calebites in the Bible?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Numbers 13:2 Mean</div><b>Send out for yourself</b><p>God tells Moses, &#8220;Send out for yourself&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/13-2.htm">Numbers 13:2</a>). The initiative clearly lies with the LORD, yet He allows Moses to act. Scripture presents this as both a divine command and, according to <a href="/deuteronomy/1-22.htm">Deuteronomy 1:22-23</a>, a response to the people&#8217;s request. That pairing teaches:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s will is sovereign, but He graciously weaves human participation into His purposes.<p>&#8226; Obedience must be personal&#8212;Moses cannot delegate responsibility for the decision.<p>&#8226; The phrase echoes earlier calls to act on God&#8217;s word, such as <a href="/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9</a> (&#8220;Choose some of our men and go out&#8230;&#8221;) and <a href="/joshua/1-2.htm">Joshua 1:2</a> (&#8220;Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan&#8230;&#8221;), underscoring that faith always moves from promise to action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>men to spy out the land of Canaan</b><p>The mission is reconnaissance, not because God needs data, but because His people do. By letting them see the land, He strengthens their confidence in His promise (compare <a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>, where spies scout Jericho). Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Practical preparation and spiritual trust are companions, not competitors (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Seeing the goodness of the land should have stirred worship, just as <a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a> invites us to &#8220;taste and see&#8221; the LORD&#8217;s goodness.<p>&#8226; The term &#8220;spy out&#8221; reminds us that faith is informed yet still faith; the facts gathered would demand a response of trust, not fear (<a href="/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which I am giving to the Israelites</b><p>This clause anchors the whole verse: the land is already God&#8217;s gift. His covenant promise stretches from <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a> (&#8220;To your offspring I will give this land&#8221;) through <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a> (&#8220;to bring them&#8230; into a good and spacious land&#8221;) and will be affirmed again in <a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-45</a> (&#8220;Not one of all the LORD&#8217;s good promises to Israel failed&#8221;). Therefore:<p>&#8226; The scouts are not to decide whether the promise is doable, but to discover how God will fulfill it.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s gift is unconditional in intent, though entering it requires faith (<a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;giving&#8221; is present-tense&#8212;His provision is active and ongoing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from each of their fathers&#8217; tribes</b><p>Representation matters. By sending one man from every tribe, the LORD ensures unified ownership of the mission and the promise. Compare <a href="/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4</a> (&#8220;One man from each tribe, each the head of his father&#8217;s household&#8221;) and <a href="/joshua/4-4.htm">Joshua 4:4</a> (one man per tribe carrying stones from the Jordan). Practical implications:<p>&#8226; No tribe can later claim ignorance or exclusion.<p>&#8226; The whole nation, not merely a select elite, stands accountable for the report and its response.<p>&#8226; Diversity within unity foreshadows the body-life principle in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>send one man who is a leader among them</b><p>God chooses recognized leaders, not anonymous foot soldiers (see <a href="/numbers/1-16.htm">Numbers 1:16</a>, &#8220;these were the leaders of the congregation&#8221;). Leaders shape the narrative; their faith or fear will ripple through their tribes (<a href="/numbers/14-1.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>). Note:<p>&#8226; Leadership carries weighty responsibility&#8212;<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a> warns that teachers/leaders incur stricter judgment.<p>&#8226; True leadership aligns with God&#8217;s promise, as modeled later by Joshua and Caleb (<a href="/numbers/14-6.htm">Numbers 14:6-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Selection criteria emphasize proven character and influence, reminding us that leadership is stewardship (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/13-2.htm">Numbers 13:2</a> combines divine promise with human participation.

Every phrase calls Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;to respond in unified, informed, courageous faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Every one a ruler among them.--</span>Or, <span class= "ital">a prince among them, </span>as in <a href="/numbers/1-16.htm" title="These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.">Numbers 1:16</a>.

The tribe of Levi, as in the former case, is not represented, as the Levites were to have no inheritance in the land, and the number of twelve, as in Numbers 1, is. made up by the division of the tribe of Joseph into the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Send thou men, that they may search the land.</span> If this account of the mission of the spies be compared with that given in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-20.htm">Deuteronomy 1:20-25</a>, it may be seen in a striking instance how entirely different a colour may be put upon the same circumstances by two inspired narratives. No one indeed will affirm that the two records are contradictory, or even inconsistent, and yet they leave an entirely different impression upon the mind; and no doubt were intended to. It is important to note that the Divine inspiration did not in the least prevent two sacred authors (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/24-1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a> with <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>), or even the same author at different times, from placing on record very distinct and even strongly contrasted aspects of the same facts, according to the point of view from which he was led to regard them. In <a href="/deuteronomy/1.htm">Deuteronomy 1</a>, Moses reminds the people that on their arrival at Kadesh he had bidden them go up and take possession; that <span class="accented">they</span> had then proposed to send men before them to examine the land; that the proposal had pleased him so well that he had adopted it and acted upon it. It is unquestionably strange that facts so material should have been omitted in the historical Book of Numbers. It is, however, to be considered - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That there is no contradiction between the two accounts. We may be certain from many a recorded example that Moses would not have acted on the popular suggestion without referring the matter to the Lord, and that it would be the Divine command (when given) which would really weigh with him. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the recital in Deuteronomy is distinctly <span class="accented">ad populum</span>, and that therefore their part in the whole transaction is as strongly emphasized as is consistent with the truth of the facts. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That the narrative of Numbers is fragmentary, and does not profess to give a full account of matters, especially in such particulars as do not directly concern the Divine government and guidance of Israel. It is not, therefore, a serious difficulty that the record only begins here at the point when God adopted as his own what had been the demand of the people. If we ask why he so adopted it, the probable answer is that he knew what secret disaffection prompted it, and to what open rebellion it would lead. It was better that such disaffection should be allowed to ripen into rebellion before they entered their promised land. Miserable as the desert wandering might be, it was yet a discipline which prepared the nation for better things; whereas the invasion of Canaan without strong faith, courage, and self-restraint (such as they showed under Joshua) could but have ended in national disaster and destruction. <span class="cmt_word">Of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man.</span> This was not part of the original proposition (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-22.htm">Deuteronomy 1:22</a>), but was agreeable to the general practice in matters of national concern, and was no doubt commanded in order that the whole people might share in the interest and responsibility of this survey. Every one a ruler among them. This does not mean that they were to be the tribe princes (as the names show), for they would not be suitable in respect of age, nor could they be spared for this service.
