The goat symbolizes the removal of sin and impurity from the community, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a> during the Day of Atonement. The male goat, specifically, is often associated with atonement for the leaders or the community as a whole. This offering underscores the need for purification and reconciliation with God, highlighting the seriousness of sin and the necessity of atonement. The sin offering points forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>in addition to the regular burnt offering</b><br>The regular burnt offering was a daily ritual, signifying the people's continual dedication and commitment to God. It was a holistic offering, with the entire animal consumed by fire, symbolizing complete surrender to God's will. This regular offering served as a constant reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The addition of the sin offering to the regular burnt offering emphasizes the layered nature of Israel's worship, where atonement and dedication go hand in hand. This reflects the comprehensive nature of worship that includes both repentance and devotion.<p><b>with its grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, often accompanying burnt offerings, represents the fruits of human labor and the acknowledgment of God's provision. It was typically made of fine flour, oil, and frankincense, symbolizing purity, sustenance, and prayer. The inclusion of the grain offering alongside the burnt and sin offerings illustrates the holistic approach to worship, where both spiritual and material aspects of life are dedicated to God. This offering can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), providing spiritual nourishment to believers.<p><b>and drink offering</b><br>The drink offering, usually consisting of wine, was poured out at the altar, symbolizing the pouring out of one's life in service to God. It complements the other offerings, representing joy and thanksgiving. The drink offering's inclusion signifies the fullness of worship, where every aspect of life, including joy and celebration, is offered to God. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice, as Paul refers to his own life being poured out as a drink offering (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>), paralleling the sacrificial nature of Jesus' ministry and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are receiving instructions on how to conduct offerings and sacrifices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is conveying God's commandments regarding the offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where these offerings are to be made, serving as the dwelling place of God among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_tabernacles.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>The specific event during which these offerings are to be made, a time of celebration and remembrance of God's provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_animals.htm">Sacrificial Animals</a></b><br>Bulls, rams, and lambs, which are to be offered as part of the prescribed sacrifices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_purpose_of_sacrifices.htm">Understanding the Purpose of Sacrifices</a></b><br>The sacrifices were a means for the Israelites to maintain a right relationship with God, acknowledging their dependence on Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_offerings.htm">Symbolism of the Offerings</a></b><br>Each type of offering (grain, drink, animal) symbolized different aspects of devotion and thanksgiving to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_obedience.htm">The Role of Obedience</a></b><br>The detailed instructions underscore the importance of obedience to God's commands as an expression of faith and reverence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/foreshadowing_of_christ's_sacrifice.htm">Foreshadowing of Christ's Sacrifice</a></b><br>The sacrificial system points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who fulfills and surpasses the need for continual offerings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_a_sacrifice_today.htm">Living as a Sacrifice Today</a></b><br>Believers are called to live sacrificially, offering their lives in service and worship to God, reflecting His holiness in their daily actions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_29_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 29:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_29_22_s_atonement_relevance.htm">How does Numbers 29:22 emphasize the importance of atonement in our lives today?

Yet amid the escalating numbers of bulls, rams, and lambs, He singles out &#8220;one male goat.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The goat stands out by its solitary nature. Where multiple animals emphasize celebration, this lone goat quietly signals the need for individual, personal atonement.<p>&#8226; Earlier, God required a single goat on the Day of Atonement to carry the people&#8217;s sins outside the camp (<a href="/leviticus/16-15.htm">Leviticus 16:15-22</a>). Placing one goat here reminds worshipers that even in joyful feasting, sin must be dealt with. <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a> underlines the point: &#8220;Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as a sin offering</b><p>&#8226; A sin offering addresses unintentional or unknown sin (<a href="/leviticus/4-27.htm">Leviticus 4:27-35</a>). By prescribing it during the feast, God guards His people from assuming that celebration cancels culpability.<p>&#8226; Key truths highlighted:<p>&#8211; Sin is universal&#8212;festive seasons do not pause our need for forgiveness (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p>&#8211; God provides a substitute&#8212;He accepts the life of another in place of the guilty (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>).<p>&#8211; The pattern points to Christ&#8212;&#8220;He Himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Even today, believers rejoice while remembering that every celebration is built on the finished sin offering of Jesus (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in addition to the regular burnt offering</b><p>&#8226; Israel offered two lambs every day, morning and evening (<a href="/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3-4</a>). Those &#8220;regular&#8221; sacrifices maintained an uninterrupted aroma of devotion before the Lord.<p>&#8226; By adding the feast sacrifices &#8220;in addition,&#8221; God teaches that special moments never replace daily faithfulness. The extraordinary builds on the ordinary.<p>&#8226; Practical application:<p>&#8211; Daily worship (prayer, Scripture) remains foundational.<p>&#8211; Special gatherings&#8212;conferences, holidays, revivals&#8212;enhance but do not substitute for steady devotion (<a href="/psalms/92-1.htm">Psalm 92:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with its grain offering and drink offering</b><p>&#8226; Every burnt offering was accompanied by a grain offering (fine flour mixed with oil) and a drink offering (wine) as outlined in <a href="/numbers/15-4.htm">Numbers 15:4-10</a>.<p>&#8226; Together they portray a complete gift:<p>&#8211; Burnt offering = total consecration (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p>&#8211; Grain offering = thankful recognition of God&#8217;s provision (<a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14-15</a>).<p>&#8211; Drink offering = poured-out devotion, anticipating Christ who &#8220;poured out His life unto death&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>) and echoed by Paul: &#8220;I am already being poured out like a drink offering&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The trio reinforces that forgiveness leads to wholehearted gratitude and joyful surrender.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/29-22.htm">Numbers 29:22</a> places one conspicuous goat amid a festival&#8217;s abundance to remind worshipers that sin still requires atonement. God couples that sin offering with the standing daily burnt offering and its grain and drink portions to display a balanced life of continual devotion, thankful provision, and poured-out commitment. The verse quietly but powerfully points ahead to Jesus, the once-for-all sin offering who fulfills every symbol and secures our freedom to celebrate in holiness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/29-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Include one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1425;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">male goat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#347;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
