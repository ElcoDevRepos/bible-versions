This highlights the familial connections between Moses and the Midianites, a nomadic tribe in the region. The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah, linking them to the broader narrative of God's covenant with Abraham. This relationship is significant as it shows the interconnectedness of different tribes and peoples in the biblical narrative. The Midianites, though not Israelites, play a role in the story of Israel's journey, reflecting the broader theme of God's plan involving various nations.<p><b>&#8220;We are setting out for the place of which the LORD said: &#8216;I will give it to you.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase refers to the Promised Land, a central theme in the Pentateuch. God's promise to give the land to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is a recurring motif, emphasizing His faithfulness and the fulfillment of His covenant. The journey to the Promised Land is both a physical and spiritual journey, symbolizing the transition from slavery to freedom and from promise to fulfillment. This promise is foundational to Israel's identity and mission, and it foreshadows the ultimate rest and inheritance believers find in Christ.<p><b>Come with us, and we will treat you well</b><br>Moses extends an invitation to Hobab, offering him a place among the Israelites. This reflects the inclusive nature of God's people, where those outside the covenant community are welcomed to join and share in the blessings. It also underscores the importance of community and mutual support during the journey. The offer to treat Hobab well indicates a commitment to justice and kindness, values central to the covenant community. This invitation can be seen as a type of the invitation Christ extends to all to join His kingdom.<p><b>for the LORD has promised good things to Israel.&#8221;</b><br>The promise of good things to Israel is rooted in God's covenantal faithfulness. These good things include the land, prosperity, protection, and a unique relationship with God. This assurance of divine blessing is a source of hope and motivation for the Israelites as they journey through the wilderness. It also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and His ability to fulfill His promises. The ultimate fulfillment of God's promises to Israel is found in Jesus Christ, who brings spiritual blessings and eternal life to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hobab.htm">Hobab</a></b><br>The son of Reuel (also known as Jethro), Moses' father-in-law.

But when it is remembered that more than forty years had elapsed since Moses left the land of Egypt and came into that of Midian, and that he was now upwards of eighty years of age, it is much more probable that he should seek the aid of a guide through the wilderness amongst those of the same generation with Zipporah than amongst those of a generation above her. Whether Hobab accompanied Jethro on the occasion of the visit to Moses which is recorded in Exodus 18, whilst the Israelites were encamped at Sinai, and remained with them after Jethro's departure (<a href="/numbers/10-27.htm" title="And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.">Numbers 10:27</a>), or whether the Israelites had already commenced their journey (compare the words of Moses, "We are journeying," or, <span class= "ital">setting forward, </span>with the concluding words of <a href="/numbers/10-28.htm" title="Thus were the journeys of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward.">Numbers 10:28</a>, <span class= "ital">and they set forward, </span>and were at this time passing through the territory in which Hobab, as the chief of a nomad tribe, was living, cannot positively be determined. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hobab, the sou of Raguel</span> (or rather Reuel, of which Raguel is simply the Septuagint and Vulgate variation), Moses' father-in-law. It is not quite certain who this "Hobab" was. The name occurs only here and in <a href="/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>. The older opinion, followed by the A.V., identified Hobab with Jethro, and Jethro with Reuel the "priest of Midian," and father of Zipporah, Moses' wife. It is, of course, no real objection to this opinion that Hobab is here called the "son of Reuel;" for the name may quite well have been an hereditary one, like Abimelech and so many others. Nor need the multiplicity of names given to one individual astonish us, for it is of frequent occurrence in the Old Testament, and not infrequent in the New. The father-in-law of Moses was a priest, holding (probably by right of birth) the patriarchal dignity of tribal priest, as Job did on a smaller, and Melchizedec on a larger, scale. He may very well, therefore, have had one or more "official" names in addition to his personal name. If this is accepted, then it may serve as one instance amongst many to remind us how extremely careless the inspired writers are about names - "careless" not in the sense of not caring whether they are right or wrong, but in the sense of not betraying and not feeling the least anxiety to avoid the appearance and suspicion of inaccuracy. Even in the lists of the twelve apostles we arc forced to believe that "Judas the brother of James" is the same person as "Lebbaeus" and "Thaddaeus;" and it is a matter of endless discussion whether or no "Bartholomew" was the same as "Nathanael." On the face of it Scripture proclaims that it uses no arts, that it takes no pains to preserve an appearance of accuracy - that appearance which is so easily simulated for the purposes of falsehood. Holy Scripture may therefore fairly claim to be read without that captiousness, without that demand for minute carefulness and obvious consistency, which we rightly apply to one of our own histories. The modern historian avowedly tells his story as a witness does in the presence of a hostile counsel; the sacred historian tells his as a man does to the children round his knee. Surely such an obvious fact should disarm a good deal of the petty criticism which carps at the sacred narrative. Many, however, will think that the balance of probability is against the older opinion. It is certain that the word translated "father-in-law" has no such definiteness either in the Hebrew or in the Septuagint. It means simply a "marriage relation," and is even used by Zipporah of Moses himself (<a href="/exodus/4-25.htm">Exodus 4:25, 26</a> - Hebrew. The Septuagint avoids the word). It is just as likely to mean "brother-in-law" when applied to Hobab. As Moses was already eighty years old when Jethro is first mentioned (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>), it may seem probable that his father-in-law was by that time dead, and succeeded in his priestly office by his eldest son. In that case Hobab would be a younger son of Reuel, and as such free to leave the home of his ancestors and to join himself to his sister's people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/10-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
