The short blasts, or teruah, were distinct from the long blasts, or tekiah, and served different purposes. The use of trumpets was a common practice in ancient Israel for communication, signaling movement, and calling assemblies. The second sounding indicates a structured and orderly process for the Israelites' journey, emphasizing the importance of divine order and obedience in their movements.<p><b>the camps that lie on the south side are to set out</b><br>The south side refers to the specific arrangement of the Israelite tribes around the Tabernacle, as detailed in <a href="/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>. The tribes on the south side included Reuben, Simeon, and Gad. This organized departure underscores the meticulous planning and divine instruction given to the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It reflects God's sovereignty and the importance of following His commands precisely. The movement of the tribes in a specific order also symbolizes unity and cooperation among the people of God.<p><b>The blasts are to signal them to set out</b><br>The use of trumpet blasts as signals highlights the importance of clear communication within the community. It ensured that the entire camp moved in unison, preventing chaos and confusion. This method of signaling can be seen as a precursor to the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding believers today, as well as the call to be attentive to God's direction. The concept of setting out at the sound of the trumpet also has eschatological implications, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>, where the trumpet call of God signals the return of Christ and the gathering of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received instructions from God on how to organize the camp and the journey.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were journeying from Mount Sinai to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/camps_on_the_east_side.htm">Camps on the East Side</a></b><br>Refers to the tribes of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun, who were camped on the east side of the tabernacle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/trumpets.htm">Trumpets</a></b><br>Silver trumpets were used to signal the movement of the camps and to communicate God's instructions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_journey.htm">Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The broader context of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, guided by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_order_and_organization.htm">Divine Order and Organization</a></b><br>God is a God of order, and He provides specific instructions for His people.
