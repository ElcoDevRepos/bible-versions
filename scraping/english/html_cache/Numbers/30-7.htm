This reflects the patriarchal structure of society, where the husband was responsible for the spiritual and physical well-being of the family. The husband's role in hearing the vow indicates his responsibility to oversee and guide the spiritual commitments made within his household. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>, where the husband is described as the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church.<p><b>but says nothing to her on that day</b><br>The phrase "on that day" emphasizes the immediacy and urgency of the husband's response. In the cultural and legal context of the time, silence was considered consent. If the husband did not object to the vow on the day he heard it, his silence was interpreted as agreement. This principle of immediate response is seen in other areas of biblical law, where timely action is required to confirm or nullify agreements (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/27-10.htm">Leviticus 27:10</a>).<p><b>then the vows or pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand</b><br>The binding nature of vows in ancient Israel underscores the seriousness with which they were regarded. Vows were not to be taken lightly, as they were promises made before God. <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a> warns against making vows rashly and emphasizes the importance of fulfilling them. The husband's role in affirming or nullifying the vow highlights the balance between individual commitment and communal responsibility within the family unit. This reflects the broader biblical theme of accountability and the importance of keeping one's word, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>, where Jesus teaches that one's "yes" should mean "yes," and "no" should mean "no."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received and communicated God's laws, including those concerning vows.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws were given, living in the wilderness during their journey to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/husband.htm">Husband</a></b><br>The male spouse who has the authority to confirm or nullify his wife's vows according to the cultural and legal context of ancient Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wife.htm">Wife</a></b><br>The female spouse who makes a vow or pledge, subject to her husband's confirmation or annulment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vows.htm">Vows</a></b><br>Promises or commitments made to God, which were taken very seriously in the Israelite community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_vows.htm">The Importance of Vows</a></b><br>Vows are serious commitments before God.
