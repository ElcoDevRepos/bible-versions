The age of thirty was often seen as the beginning of a man's full maturity and capability to take on significant responsibilities. For example, Joseph began his service to Pharaoh at age thirty (<a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>), and David became king at thirty (<a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>). The age of fifty marked the end of this period of service, allowing for a transition to roles that required less physical exertion. This age range ensured that those serving were at their peak in terms of physical and mental capabilities, crucial for the demanding tasks associated with the Tent of Meeting.<p><b>who came to serve</b><br>The Hebrew word for "serve" here implies a dedicated and consecrated service, often associated with priestly or Levitical duties. This service was not merely a job but a sacred duty, reflecting a life set apart for God's work. The Levites were chosen by God to assist the priests and perform tasks related to the Tabernacle, emphasizing the importance of their role in maintaining the spiritual life of the Israelite community. This service was a form of worship and obedience to God's commands, highlighting the Levites' unique position among the tribes of Israel.<p><b>in the work</b><br>The "work" referred to the various tasks required for the maintenance and operation of the Tent of Meeting, including setting up, taking down, and transporting the Tabernacle and its furnishings. This work was both physically demanding and spiritually significant, as it involved handling sacred objects and ensuring the proper functioning of the central place of worship for the Israelites. The Levites' work was essential for the community's ability to worship and maintain their covenant relationship with God.<p><b>at the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the portable sanctuary used by the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It was the central place of worship and the location where God's presence dwelled among His people. The Tent of Meeting was a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem and held great significance as the focal point of Israelite religious life. It was here that sacrifices were offered, and God's instructions were received. The Tent of Meeting symbolized God's desire to dwell with His people and foreshadowed the coming of Jesus Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), fulfilling the ultimate purpose of God's presence with humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kohathites.htm">The Kohathites</a></b><br>A Levitical family responsible for the care of the most sacred objects of the Tabernacle, including the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received and communicated God's instructions regarding the organization and duties of the Levites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting (Tabernacle)</a></b><br>The portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where the Kohathites performed their duties.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting for the Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land, where the Tabernacle was set up and taken down as they traveled.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_age_range.htm">The Age Range (30-50 years)</a></b><br>The specified age range for those eligible to serve in the Tabernacle, indicating a period of maturity and strength.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_service.htm">The Importance of Service</a></b><br>The Kohathites' role underscores the value of serving God with dedication and reverence.
