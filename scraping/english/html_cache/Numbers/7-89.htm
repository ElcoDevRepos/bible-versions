It was a sacred space where God communicated with Moses, the leader of the Israelites. The construction of the Tabernacle was commanded by God and described in detail in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-31</a>. It served as a central place of worship and a symbol of God's presence with His people.<p><b>to speak with the LORD</b><br>Moses had a unique relationship with God, characterized by direct communication. Unlike other prophets who received visions or dreams, Moses spoke with God "face to face" (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>). This phrase emphasizes the personal and intimate nature of Moses' interactions with God, highlighting his role as a mediator between God and the Israelites.<p><b>he heard the voice speaking to him</b><br>The voice of God was a direct and audible communication, signifying the divine authority and guidance provided to Moses. This mode of communication underscores the importance of the messages Moses received, which were to be conveyed to the people of Israel. It also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to guide His people through Moses.<p><b>from between the two cherubim</b><br>The cherubim were angelic figures placed on the mercy seat, which was the cover of the Ark of the Covenant. Their presence symbolized the holiness and majesty of God. In ancient Near Eastern culture, cherubim were often depicted as guardians of sacred spaces, and their inclusion in the design of the Ark emphasized the sacredness of the space where God would meet with Moses.<p><b>above the mercy seat on the ark of the Testimony</b><br>The mercy seat was the gold cover of the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the tablets of the Ten Commandments, also known as the Testimony. The mercy seat was considered the throne of God on earth, where His presence dwelt. This location was the focal point of God's communication with Moses, symbolizing God's covenant and His mercy towards His people.<p><b>Thus the LORD spoke to him</b><br>This phrase confirms the divine origin of the messages Moses received. It underscores the authority of the instructions and laws given to Moses, which were to be followed by the Israelites. The communication between God and Moses was foundational for the establishment of the covenant relationship between God and His people, and it prefigures the ultimate revelation of God through Jesus Christ, who is described as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.

This models prayer as dialogue (<a href="/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a>).<p>- Jesus later exemplifies the same intimacy in <a href="/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1-3</a>, bridging conversation between Father and people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He heard the voice speaking to him</b><p>- God&#8217;s voice is audible and personal. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-33.htm">Deuteronomy 4:33</a> reminds Israel, &#8220;Has any people heard the voice of God speaking out of the fire, as you have, and lived?&#8221;.<p>- Scripture&#8217;s authority rests on God&#8217;s spoken word (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).

Hithpael, as in <a href="/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>. Here is a distinct statement of the supernatural fact that God spake to Moses with an audible human voice, and (no doubt) in the Hebrew language, from out the empty darkness behind the veil. In the fact, indeed, of God so speaking audibly there was nothing new (see <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>, etc.), nor in the fact of his so speaking to Moses (see <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a> and Exodus 33:9); but this records the fulfillment of that promise which was part of God's covenant with Israel, that he would at all times converse with Moses as their mediator from above the mercy-seat (see on Exodus 25:20-22, and cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/5-23.htm">Deuteronomy 5:23-28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he spake unto him,</span> i.e., God spake unto Moses: the voice made itself audible, and by the voice God himself spake unto him. It is quite obvious that this statement more properly belongs to an earlier period, viz., to that immediately succeeding the consecration of the tabernacle. On the day it was set up Moses was not able to enter it (<a href="/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>), but no doubt he did so very soon afterwards, and received from the mouth of the Lord, speaking in the holiest, all the commandments and ordinances recorded in Leviticus and in the beginning of this book. Perhaps the first communication made to him in this way concerned the offerings of the princes when first brought near (verses 4, 11), and for that reason the statement may have been appended to the record of those offerings. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/7-89.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">entered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
