This reflects the immense responsibility placed upon him as the leader of a large and often rebellious group. The context here is the Israelites' complaints about their hardships and desire for meat, which adds to Moses' stress. This phrase highlights the human limitations of even the most faithful leaders. It echoes the need for shared leadership, as seen later when God instructs Moses to appoint seventy elders to help him (<a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16-17</a>). This concept of shared leadership is also seen in the New Testament with the appointment of deacons in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-7</a> to assist the apostles.<p><b>it is too burdensome for me.</b><br>Moses' admission of the burden reflects the weight of leadership and the challenges of guiding a nation through the wilderness. The Hebrew word for "burdensome" can also imply a heaviness or weight that is too great to bear alone. This moment of vulnerability shows Moses' humanity and foreshadows the need for divine assistance and community support. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who invites those who are weary and burdened to come to Him for rest (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>). Moses' struggle here can be seen as a type of Christ, who bore the ultimate burden of sin for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Instead, He invites leaders to confess weakness, receive His strength, and enlist faithful helpers. From Jethro&#8217;s counsel to the appointment of elders, from the apostles&#8217; delegation to the body of Christ bearing one another&#8217;s burdens, Scripture consistently demonstrates that God&#8217;s work flourishes through shared responsibility empowered by His Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">To bear all this people alone.--</span>In accordance with the advice of Jethro, able men had been chosen out of all Israel who heard and determined the small matters which arose among them (<a href="/context/exodus/18-25.htm" title="And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.">Exodus 18:25-26</a>), but they were of no avail on occasions such as the present.<p><span class= "bld">My wretchedness.--</span>Or, <span class= "ital">my evil. </span>This is one of the eighteen places in which the scribes are said to have altered the text, and to have substituted <span class= "ital">my </span>for <span class= "ital">Thy.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">1 am not able to bear all this people alone.</span> This complaint, while reasonable in itself, shows how unreasonable the rest of his words were.
