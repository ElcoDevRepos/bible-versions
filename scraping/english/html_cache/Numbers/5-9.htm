These could include tithes, firstfruits, and other offerings dedicated to God. The concept of sacred contributions is rooted in the idea of holiness and separation for divine use, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-33</a>. This reflects the broader biblical principle that everything belongs to God, and what is given to Him is considered holy.<p><b>the Israelites bring</b><br>The Israelites, as God's chosen people, were commanded to bring offerings to the tabernacle or temple. This act of bringing offerings was a physical demonstration of their obedience and devotion to God. It also served as a reminder of their covenant relationship with Him, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>. The act of bringing offerings was a communal activity, reinforcing the collective identity and responsibility of the Israelites as a nation set apart for God.<p><b>to the priest</b><br>The priesthood, established through Aaron and his descendants, served as mediators between God and the people. Priests were responsible for performing sacrifices, maintaining the sanctuary, and teaching the law. The role of the priest is significant in understanding the sacrificial system and the need for mediation between a holy God and sinful humanity. This foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who mediates a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>shall belong to him</b><br>The provision that sacred contributions belong to the priest underscores the principle of supporting those who serve in ministry. In the ancient context, priests did not have a land inheritance like the other tribes (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-21</a>). Instead, they were sustained by the offerings of the people. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Paul speaks of those who preach the gospel living from the gospel (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>). It highlights the importance of providing for spiritual leaders, ensuring they can dedicate themselves fully to their divine duties.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, who are God's chosen people in the Old Testament.

The holiness of the offering safeguards the worshiper&#8217;s reverence. &#8226; This principle flows through Scripture: whether the tithe in <a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a> or firstfruits in <a href="/deuteronomy/26-9.htm">Deuteronomy 26:9-10</a>, everything devoted to the Lord carries His authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Israelites bring</b><p>The verb &#8220;bring&#8221; stresses personal responsibility. &#8226; Giving is active, not passive; each household had to deliver its portion (<a href="/nehemiah/10-35.htm">Nehemiah 10:35-37</a>). &#8226; Offerings arrived at the sanctuary regularly (<a href="/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15-19</a>), teaching continual dependence on God. &#8226; <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a> echoes the same invitation: &#8220;Bring the full tithe into the storehouse.&#8221; God expects His people to participate willingly, trusting His provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the priest</b><p>God channels these sacred gifts through ordained mediators. &#8226; Aaron and his sons were appointed &#8220;to serve as priests for Me&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). &#8226; <a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-9</a> clarifies that &#8220;I am giving you charge of the contributions.&#8221; The priest receives not as a private citizen but as God&#8217;s representative. &#8226; This pattern informs later teaching: &#8220;Those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>). The officeholder is sustained so he can focus on ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>shall belong to him</b><p>The law secures the priest&#8217;s livelihood. &#8226; By divine decree the sacred portion &#8220;shall belong&#8221; to the priest; no Israelite may reclaim or redirect it (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-5</a>). &#8226; This right removes anxiety about material needs and allows wholehearted service (<a href="/joshua/13-14.htm">Joshua 13:14</a>). &#8226; The same principle carries forward: &#8220;The laborer is worthy of his wages&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>), showing God&#8217;s ongoing concern for those who lead His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/5-9.htm">Numbers 5:9</a> teaches that every holy offering presented by the Israelites becomes the rightful provision of the priest.
