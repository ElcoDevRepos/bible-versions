It underscores the personal relationship between God and Moses, highlighting Moses' unique role as a mediator. The concept of God "coming down" is a theophany, where God manifests in a tangible way, emphasizing His willingness to engage with humanity. This also foreshadows the incarnation of Christ, where God comes down to dwell among His people (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>and I will take some of the Spirit that is on you</b><br>The Spirit here refers to the Holy Spirit, who empowers and guides. In the Old Testament, the Spirit's presence on individuals was often for specific tasks or leadership roles, as seen with figures like Samson (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). This sharing of the Spirit signifies the delegation of authority and the communal nature of leadership within God's people. It also prefigures the New Testament Pentecost, where the Spirit is distributed among believers (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>).<p><b>and put that Spirit on them</b><br>This action signifies the empowerment of the seventy elders to assist Moses. It reflects the biblical principle of shared leadership and the distribution of spiritual gifts for the edification of the community (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>). The elders' anointing parallels the New Testament practice of laying on of hands to confer the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/8-17.htm">Acts 8:17</a>). It also highlights the importance of community and collective responsibility in God's plan.<p><b>They will help you bear the burden of the people</b><br>The burden refers to the leadership and judgment responsibilities Moses carried, which had become overwhelming (<a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>). This delegation of duties is a practical solution to leadership challenges, emphasizing the need for support and teamwork. It reflects the biblical principle of bearing one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>) and the importance of shared ministry in the body of Christ.<p><b>so that you do not have to bear it by yourself</b><br>This phrase underscores the limitations of human strength and the necessity of relying on others. It highlights the dangers of isolation in leadership and the importance of community support. Theologically, it points to the sufficiency of God's provision and the interdependence of His people. It also serves as a reminder of Christ's invitation to find rest in Him, as He bears our ultimate burdens (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

It is strange that in the face of the clear teaching of St. Paul in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12, 13</a>, and in view of such cases as those of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>; 19:93) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), any difficulty should have been felt about this passage. <span class="cmt_word">They shall bear the burden of the people with thee.</span> It does not appear how they were to do this, nor is there any record of their work. Their gifts, however, were spiritual, and we may probably assume that their usefulness lay in producing and maintaining a proper religious tone among the people. The real difficulty which stood in the way of Moses was not one of outward organization or of government, for that had been amply provided for; it lay in the bad tone which prevailed among the people, and threatened to destroy at any moment the very foundations of their national hope and safety. We may see in these seventy not indeed a Sanhedrim to exercise authority and discipline, but the first commencement of that prophetic order which afterwards played so large a part in the religious history of Israel and of the early Christian Church - an order designed kern the first to supplement by the freedom and originality of their ministry the more formal and unvarying offices of the priesthood. If this was the nature of their usefulness, it is not surprising that they are never mentioned again; and it is observable that a similar obscurity hangs over the activity of the prophets of the New Testament, who yet formed a most important part of the gospel <span class="accented">regime</span> (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-29.htm">1 Corinthians 14:29-32</a>;
