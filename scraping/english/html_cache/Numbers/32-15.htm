In the context of <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>, the tribes of Reuben and Gad requested to settle east of the Jordan River, which could be seen as a reluctance to fully enter the Promised Land. Turning away from God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often leading to dire consequences. This echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> about the blessings of obedience and the curses of disobedience. It also reflects the human tendency to stray from God, as seen in the story of the Israelites' repeated cycles of sin and repentance in the Book of Judges.<p><b>He will once again leave this people in the wilderness,</b><br>This phrase recalls the 40 years of wandering in the wilderness as a result of the Israelites' lack of faith and disobedience after the Exodus from Egypt. The wilderness represents a place of testing and judgment, as well as a period of divine discipline. The threat of returning to the wilderness underscores the seriousness of the consequences of turning away from God. It serves as a reminder of the previous generation that perished in the wilderness due to their unbelief, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>. The wilderness experience is also a type of spiritual journey, symbolizing the trials believers face before reaching their ultimate rest in God.<p><b>and you will be the cause of their destruction.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the communal responsibility and the potential impact of individual actions on the larger community. The decision of the tribes of Reuben and Gad could lead to discouragement and division among the Israelites, ultimately resulting in their downfall. This reflects the biblical principle that sin and disobedience can have far-reaching effects, not just on the individual but on the entire community. The concept of corporate responsibility is seen throughout Scripture, such as in the sin of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, which brought trouble upon all Israel. It also points to the importance of unity and collective faithfulness in achieving God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is addressing the tribes of Reuben and Gad regarding their request to settle on the east side of the Jordan River.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben_and_gad.htm">Reuben and Gad</a></b><br>Two tribes of Israel who requested to settle in the land of Gilead, east of the Jordan, instead of crossing into the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites wandered for 40 years due to their disobedience and lack of faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from Egypt and were on their journey to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god's_commands.htm">Faithfulness to God&#8217;s Commands</a></b><br>The importance of remaining faithful to God's commands is emphasized.

The little word &#8220;if&#8221; highlights personal responsibility and genuine choice.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Turn away&#8221; pictures a deliberate shift of allegiance&#8212;much like the first generation that &#8220;refused to go up&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-26.htm">Deuteronomy 1:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly warns believers not to drift: &#8220;See to it, brothers, that none of you has a wicked heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The call is to follow, not merely admire, the LORD. Jesus echoes the same heart centuries later: &#8220;My sheep listen to My voice, and they follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will once again leave this people in the wilderness</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Once again&#8221; reaches back to <a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-35</a>, when unbelief sentenced Israel to forty years of wandering. History can repeat itself if hearts repeat old sins.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s presence is conditional on loyalty. When Judah rebelled, the glory departed (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18-19</a>). When the churches neglect their first love, He warns, &#8220;I will come and remove your lampstand&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Wilderness life is not God&#8217;s ideal; it is discipline. Yet even there He sustains&#8212;&#8220;These forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-7.htm">Deuteronomy 2:7</a>). Mercy endures, but fellowship and forward progress stall.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you will be the cause of their destruction</b><p>&#8226; Sin never stays private. Gad and Reuben&#8217;s reluctance would discourage the whole nation just as the ten spies did (<a href="/bsb/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13-14</a>). Achan&#8217;s hidden greed led to Israel&#8217;s defeat at Ai (<a href="/bsb/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament presses the same truth: &#8220;Make up your mind not to put any stumbling block in your brother&#8217;s way&#8221; (<a href="/romans/14-13.htm">Romans 14:13</a>). Jesus pronounces severe warning: &#8220;Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck&#8221; (<a href="/mark/9-42.htm">Mark 9:42</a>).<p>&#8226; Leadership carries weight. By choosing comfort east of the Jordan, these tribes risked becoming the domino that toppled the entire covenant community.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/32-15.htm">Numbers 32:15</a> is a sober reminder that obedience brings blessing, while deliberate withdrawal from God&#8217;s path invites discipline not only on the individual but on the community.
