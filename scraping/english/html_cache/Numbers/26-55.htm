This method ensured that the distribution was seen as fair and ordained by God, removing human bias. The casting of lots is also seen in other biblical contexts, such as the selection of Saul as king (<a href="/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20-24</a>) and the replacement of Judas Iscariot by Matthias (<a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>). This practice underscores the belief in God's sovereignty and providence in the affairs of His people.<p><b>they shall receive their inheritance</b><br>The concept of inheritance is central to the identity and faith of the Israelites. The land was not merely a possession but a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). It symbolized God's covenant faithfulness and was a tangible sign of His blessing. The inheritance was meant to be perpetual, passed down through generations, emphasizing the continuity of God's promise and the importance of family lineage in Israelite society. This inheritance also prefigures the spiritual inheritance believers receive through Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>.<p><b>according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.</b><br>The division of the land according to tribal names highlights the importance of tribal identity and lineage in Israel. Each tribe's portion was linked to the patriarchal promises given to the sons of Jacob, reinforcing the covenantal relationship between God and the descendants of the patriarchs. This tribal division also ensured that each family within the tribe had a stake in the land, promoting social stability and continuity. The emphasis on tribal names connects to the broader biblical narrative, where genealogies and tribal affiliations play a crucial role in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, as seen in the genealogies of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is overseeing the census and the division of the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of the twelve tribes of Israel, who are preparing to enter and settle in the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancestral_tribes.htm">Ancestral Tribes</a></b><br>The twelve tribes of Israel, each descending from one of the sons of Jacob (Israel).<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/division_by_lot.htm">Division by Lot</a></b><br>The method by which the land is to be distributed among the tribes, signifying God's sovereignty in the allocation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_inheritance.htm">God's Sovereignty in Inheritance</a></b><br>The division of the land by lot underscores God's ultimate authority and control over the distribution of resources and blessings.
