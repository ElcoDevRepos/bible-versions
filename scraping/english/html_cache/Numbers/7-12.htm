The first day signifies the start of a twelve-day period where each tribe presents offerings. This structured approach reflects the order and organization within the Israelite camp, as seen throughout the book of Numbers.<p><b>Nahshon son of Amminadab</b><br>Nahshon is a prominent figure in the tribe of Judah and is mentioned in several genealogies, including the lineage of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-4.htm">Matthew 1:4</a>, <a href="/luke/3-32.htm">Luke 3:32</a>). His leadership role is highlighted as he is the first to present offerings, indicating his status and the importance of the tribe of Judah. Nahshon's presence underscores the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing that the scepter will not depart from Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>).<p><b>from the tribe of Judah</b><br>Judah is one of the most significant tribes in Israel, known for its leadership and royal lineage. The tribe's prominence is evident in its encampment position and its role in leading the march (<a href="/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3-9</a>). Judah's offering first may symbolize its preeminence and foreshadow the coming of the Messiah from this tribe.<p><b>drew near with his offering</b><br>The act of drawing near with an offering is a form of worship and dedication to God. It reflects the Israelites' obedience and reverence. The offerings presented by each tribe were identical, symbolizing unity and equality among the tribes. This act of drawing near is a precursor to the New Testament concept of drawing near to God through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p><b>his offering</b><br>The offerings brought by Nahshon and the other leaders were substantial and included silver, gold, and animals for sacrifice. These offerings were not only acts of worship but also served practical purposes in the maintenance of the tabernacle. The detailed description of the offerings in <a href="/numbers/7.htm">Numbers 7</a> emphasizes the importance of giving and sacrifice in the worship of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahshon.htm">Nahshon</a></b><br>He is the son of Amminadab and a leader of the tribe of Judah.

The LORD instructs that each tribe bring gifts over twelve days, and &#8220;on the first day&#8221; Judah is called (<a href="/numbers/7-10.htm">Numbers 7:10&#8211;11</a>). First days in Scripture often mark fresh beginnings&#8212;think of the &#8220;first day&#8221; of creation (<a href="/genesis/1-5.htm">Genesis 1:5</a>) or the &#8220;first day of the week&#8221; when Jesus rose (<a href="/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>). By putting Judah first:<p>&#8226; God highlights order and intentionality in worship.<p>&#8226; He sets a tone of eagerness&#8212;no delay in honoring Him (cf. <a href="/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a>).<p>&#8226; He foreshadows that true worship always starts with what He has ordained, not human preference (<a href="/leviticus/9-1.htm">Leviticus 9:1, 6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nahshon son of Amminadab</b><p>Nahshon is already known as Judah&#8217;s leader in the census (<a href="/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>) and as the commander who led Judah&#8217;s army (<a href="/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>). His lineage matters:<p>&#8226; He is in the direct ancestral line of David and ultimately Jesus (<a href="/ruth/4-20.htm">Ruth 4:20&#8211;22</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-4.htm">Matthew 1:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; His sister Elisheba marries Aaron, uniting royal and priestly lines (<a href="/exodus/6-23.htm">Exodus 6:23</a>).<p>&#8226; As a leader, he models that authority is expressed in humble obedience&#8212;he brings what God asks, nothing more, nothing less.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the tribe of Judah</b><p>Judah&#8217;s placement is not accidental:<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s blessing promised, &#8220;The scepter will not depart from Judah&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Judah camped on the east side&#8212;nearest the entrance&#8212;leading Israel whenever they broke camp (<a href="/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately the Messiah is &#8220;the Lion of the tribe of Judah&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>). By spotlighting Judah first, God hints at the coming King who will perfectly dedicate Himself to the Father.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Drew near</b><p>The phrase signals approach to God.

Key observations:<p>&#8226; Every detail reflects God&#8217;s standards, showing that worship is costly and precise (<a href="/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-14.htm">Malachi 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The offerings combine atonement (sin offering), consecration (burnt offering), communion (fellowship offering), and gratitude (grain and incense), portraying a full-orbed relationship with God (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s gift is identical to the other tribes&#8217;, underscoring unity&#8212;no tribe outshines another in God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-14.htm">2 Corinthians 8:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a> teaches that genuine worship begins promptly, is led by those God appoints, centers on the promised King from Judah, involves humble nearness, and offers exactly what God desires. Nahshon&#8217;s obedience foreshadows the greater Son of Judah who would perfectly draw near with the ultimate offering&#8212;His own life&#8212;so that we, too, can step forward and worship with confidence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nahshon.</span> The same appointed to act with Moses in the census, and to be captain of the children of Judah (<a href="/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>).
