The congregation refers to the entire assembly of Israel, highlighting the communal aspect of the nation. This division underscores the principle of sharing resources among God's people, reflecting the communal and covenantal nature of Israelite society. The concept of sharing spoils can be seen in other biblical narratives, such as the division of the land in Joshua. It also prefigures the New Testament teaching of sharing within the body of Christ, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>.<p><b>337,500 sheep:</b><br>The specific number of sheep indicates the vastness of the spoils taken from the Midianites, emphasizing the scale of the victory granted by God. Sheep were a significant part of the agrarian economy in ancient Israel, providing wool, meat, and milk. This large number would have been a substantial economic boon to the community. The mention of sheep also connects to the pastoral imagery frequently used in the Bible, where God's people are often likened to sheep, and God or Christ is depicted as the shepherd (Psalm 23, <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). This imagery underscores themes of provision, care, and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is overseeing the distribution of the spoils of war.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The congregation receiving their share of the spoils from the battle against the Midianites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>The people defeated by the Israelites, whose possessions are being divided.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>Part of the livestock taken as spoils, representing wealth and sustenance for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>The conflict between the Israelites and the Midianites, commanded by God as a form of judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>God provides for His people through various means, including the spoils of war.

Then divide the spoils in halves between the warriors who went out to battle and the rest of the congregation&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/31-26.htm">Numbers 31:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;This half&#8221; signals the precise, God-ordered split&#8212;one portion for the 12,000 soldiers, one equal portion for everyone else. The equity echoes later moments, such as David&#8217;s ruling that those who guarded the baggage would share the plunder with those who fought (<a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>) and Joshua&#8217;s charge to the returning eastern tribes to share their riches with the families at home (<a href="/joshua/22-8.htm">Joshua 22:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle teaches that victory and its benefits belong to the entire covenant people, not only to the visibly heroic. It safeguards unity, gratitude, and mutual care.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Belonged to the congregation</b><p>&#8226; The phrase stresses collective ownership. The congregation&#8212;men, women, children, Levites&#8212;receive God&#8217;s provision together. No Israelite is overlooked (compare <a href="/numbers/18-24.htm">Numbers 18:24</a>, where the tithe is for &#8220;the sons of Levi&#8221; because they serve the whole camp).<p>&#8226; Sharing the spoil reinforces the truth of <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>: &#8220;You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#8221; Every household participates in the blessing flowing from obedience.<p>&#8226; Later, the early church mirrors this heart: &#8220;All the believers were together and had everything in common&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44</a>). The pattern of caring for the whole assembly remains intact across covenants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>337,500 sheep</b><p>&#8226; The specific tally underlines historicity&#8212;real animals counted, real wealth distributed. Earlier verses list 675,000 sheep total (<a href="/numbers/31-32.htm">Numbers 31:32</a>), so half equals 337,500. Scripture&#8217;s detail assures us these events actually happened and were recorded with precision.<p>&#8226; Sheep meant clothing, food, and ongoing livelihood. In agrarian culture they signified tangible, sustainable provision, echoing <a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a> where Abram&#8217;s wealth is marked by livestock, and <a href="/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a> where restoration is measured by multiplied flocks.<p>&#8226; The sheer number spotlights divine generosity: &#8220;The earth is the LORD&#8217;s, and the fullness thereof&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>). God is not stingy with His people; He equips them abundantly so they can honor Him (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>) and bless others (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Sheep imagery also foreshadows Christ, the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). While Numbers records literal animals, the distribution prefigures the Shepherd&#8217;s care for every member of His flock.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/31-43.htm">Numbers 31:43</a> records a historically exact division of Midianite spoil. God ordered half the plunder to go to the fighting men and half to the wider congregation; &#8220;337,500 sheep&#8221; spotlights the scale of His provision. The verse teaches communal equity, underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness to sustain His people, and anticipates the shared life and generosity that characterize believers in every age.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/31-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">this half belonged to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1495;&#1457;&#1510;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;&#7717;&#277;&#183;&#7779;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4275.htm">Strong's 4275: </a> </span><span class="str2">A halving</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the congregation:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5712.htm">Strong's 5712: </a> </span><span class="str2">A stated assemblage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">337,500</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#353;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7969.htm">Strong's 7969: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three, third, thrice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sheep,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1465;&#1425;&#1488;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6629.htm">Strong's 6629: </a> </span><span class="str2">Small cattle, sheep and goats, flock</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/31-43.htm">Numbers 31:43 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/31-43.htm">Numbers 31:43 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/31-43.htm">Numbers 31:43 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/31-43.htm">Numbers 31:43 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/31-43.htm">Numbers 31:43 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/31-43.htm">Numbers 31:43  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/31-43.htm">Numbers 31:43 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/31-43.htm">Numbers 31:43 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/31-43.htm">Numbers 31:43 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/31-43.htm">Numbers 31:43 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/31-43.htm">OT Law: Numbers 31:43 Now the congregation's half was three hundred (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/31-42.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 31:42"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 31:42" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/31-44.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 31:44"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 31:44" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
