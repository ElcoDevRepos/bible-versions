It was a continual reminder of their covenant relationship with God. The offering was made every morning and evening, symbolizing the need for constant devotion and atonement. This practice underscores the importance of regular worship and dedication to God, reflecting the perpetual nature of God's presence and the need for ongoing atonement for sin.<p><b>established at Mount Sinai</b><br>Mount Sinai is a significant location in biblical history, where God gave the Law to Moses. The establishment of the burnt offering at Sinai highlights the foundational role of the Law in Israel's worship and community life. It was at Sinai that God formalized His covenant with Israel, and the sacrificial system was a key component of that covenant. This phrase emphasizes the divine origin and authority of the sacrificial system, rooted in the revelation at Sinai.<p><b>as a pleasing aroma</b><br>The concept of a "pleasing aroma" signifies God's acceptance of the offering. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the aroma of sacrifices was believed to ascend to the gods, symbolizing their favor. In the biblical context, it indicates that the offering, when made with a sincere heart, was acceptable to God. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose offering of Himself is described in the New Testament as a "fragrant offering" to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><b>a food offering</b><br>The term "food offering" does not imply that God needs sustenance but rather symbolizes fellowship and communion with God. In the ancient world, sharing a meal was a sign of relationship and peace. The offering represents the people's desire to maintain a harmonious relationship with God. It also points to the provision of God, who sustains His people, and prefigures the spiritual nourishment found in Christ, the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>to the LORD</b><br>The offering is directed to the LORD, emphasizing the covenant name of God, Yahweh, which signifies His eternal, self-existent nature and His special relationship with Israel. This phrase underscores the exclusivity of worship due to God alone and the importance of approaching Him according to His prescribed means. It also highlights the centrality of God in the life of Israel and the ultimate purpose of the sacrificial system: to honor and glorify Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including those concerning offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments and other laws, including the instructions for offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were commanded to follow these laws and offer sacrifices as a part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel who established the covenant and gave the laws for worship and offerings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of sacrifice that was completely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The regular burnt offering was a command from God, highlighting the importance of obedience in our worship and daily lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_sacrifice.htm">Symbolism of Sacrifice</a></b><br>The burnt offering symbolizes total dedication and surrender to God, reminding us to offer our lives as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consistency_in_worship.htm">Consistency in Worship</a></b><br>The regularity of the offering teaches us the importance of consistent and faithful worship practices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_holiness_and_our_response.htm">God's Holiness and Our Response</a></b><br>The offerings were a response to God's holiness, calling us to live lives that reflect His character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/foreshadowing_of_christ.htm">Foreshadowing of Christ</a></b><br>The sacrificial system points to Jesus Christ, the ultimate sacrifice, encouraging us to find our hope and redemption in Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_28_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 28:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Importance_of_daily_offerings_in_Num_28_6.htm">How does Numbers 28:6 emphasize the importance of daily offerings to God?
