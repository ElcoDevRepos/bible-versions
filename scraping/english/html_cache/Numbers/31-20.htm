The command to purify garments reflects the broader biblical principle of ritual cleanliness, which was essential for maintaining holiness among God's people. Garments often symbolize one's status and identity in Scripture, and their purification signifies the removal of defilement. This practice is echoed in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11-15</a>, where various laws about cleanliness are detailed. The purification process underscores the need for spiritual and physical purity before God.<p><b>and leather good</b><br>Leather goods, like garments, were common in ancient Israel and used for various purposes, including clothing, tents, and containers. The requirement to purify leather items indicates the comprehensive nature of the cleansing process. Leather, being a durable material, was valuable and often used in everyday life. This command highlights the importance of ensuring that all aspects of life, even the most mundane, are consecrated to God. The emphasis on purification can be seen as a type of Christ, who purifies believers from sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p><b>everything made of goat&#8217;s hair</b><br>Goat's hair was a common material used in the construction of tents and other items in the ancient Near East. It was known for its durability and was often used by nomadic peoples, including the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings. The inclusion of goat's hair items in the purification process reflects the thoroughness required in maintaining ritual purity. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God dwelling among His people, as the tabernacle itself was made with curtains of goat's hair (<a href="/exodus/26-7.htm">Exodus 26:7</a>).<p><b>and every article of wood.</b><br>Wooden articles were essential in daily life for the Israelites, used for tools, utensils, and construction. The command to purify wooden items emphasizes the need for holiness in all areas of life. Wood is often used symbolically in Scripture, such as in the construction of the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10</a>). The purification of wood can be seen as a reminder of the sanctity required in approaching God, who is holy. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of God&#8217;s desire for His people to be set apart and pure, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons /

class="vheading2">What Does Numbers 31:20 Mean</div><b>And purify</b><p>God&#8217;s first word is action: &#8220;purify.&#8221; After battle, the soldiers had handled corpses and pagan property, so cleansing was mandatory (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Purification underscores that the Lord &#8220;is holy&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>) and will not dwell with impurity.<p>&#8226; The command extends beyond people to objects, reminding us that sin&#8217;s reach is comprehensive.<p>&#8226; In Christ, the spiritual counterpart is ongoing: &#8220;let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a> ties Old Testament washings to the fuller cleansing found in Jesus&#8217; blood.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every garment</b><p>Clothing absorbs uncleanness; therefore &#8220;every garment&#8221; had to be washed.<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/15-17.htm">Leviticus 15:17</a> required laundering a garment that touched bodily discharge; the same principle applies here.<p>&#8226; Jude 23 urges believers to hate &#8220;even the garment stained by the flesh,&#8221; a vivid picture drawn from passages like this.<p>&#8226; Practically, no corner of life&#8212;or wardrobe&#8212;lies outside God&#8217;s call to holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And leather good</b><p>Leather, fashioned from animal hide, was common in tents, sandals, and containers.<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/13-48.htm">Leviticus 13:48</a> treated leather items exactly like garments when mildew appeared&#8212;another sign that God views materials through a moral lens.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a> recalls the Lord gifting Israel &#8220;sandals of fine leather.&#8221; Those blessings were to be kept clean for His glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Everything made of goat&#8217;s hair</b><p>Goat hair formed the sturdy outer curtains of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/26-7.htm">Exodus 26:7-13</a>), yet even such practical items needed decontamination.<p>&#8226; Objects once used for worship could still carry impurity if captured from pagan hands.<p>&#8226; The lesson: whatever our calling&#8212;whether sacred or ordinary&#8212;must pass through God&#8217;s cleansing (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And every article of wood</b><p>Wooden tools and vessels were everyday necessities.<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/15-12.htm">Leviticus 15:12</a> ordered rinsing a &#8220;wooden vessel&#8221; that became unclean; <a href="/bsb/numbers/31.htm">Numbers 31</a> applies the same standard to war plunder.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_timothy/2-20.htm">2 Timothy 2:20</a> speaks of &#8220;articles of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay,&#8221; urging believers to become vessels for honor by cleansing themselves.<p>&#8226; God leaves no loophole: if it can be contaminated, it must be purified.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/31-20.htm">Numbers 31:20</a> widens the purification net to include every category of material&#8212;fabric, leather, goat&#8217;s-hair textiles, and wood. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s holiness permeates all of life and demands thorough cleansing from anything touched by sin or death. For believers today, the outward washing foreshadows the inward cleansing secured by Christ and applied daily as we yield every part of our lives&#8212;no exceptions&#8212;to His sanctifying work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Purify all your raiment, and all that is made.</span> Literally, "every vessel" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>).
