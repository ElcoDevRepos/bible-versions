Bashan was a fertile region east of the Jordan River, known for its rich pastures and strong cities. The decision to move towards Bashan reflects God's guidance in leading the Israelites to conquer the land He promised them. This journey is part of the broader narrative of the Israelites' conquest of the Promised Land, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/3.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1-11</a>, where Moses recounts the victory over Og.<p><b>and Og king of Bashan and his whole army came out</b><br>Og, the king of Bashan, is described in <a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a> as one of the last of the Rephaim, a race of giants. His coming out with his whole army signifies a formidable opposition against the Israelites. The mention of Og's army highlights the military challenge faced by the Israelites, emphasizing the miraculous nature of their victories, which were achieved through divine intervention rather than sheer military might.<p><b>to meet them in battle at Edrei</b><br>Edrei was one of the major cities of Bashan, strategically located and fortified. The battle at Edrei is significant as it represents a direct confrontation between the Israelites and a powerful enemy. This encounter is a testament to God's promise to deliver the land into the hands of the Israelites, as seen in <a href="/numbers/21-34.htm">Numbers 21:34</a>, where God assures Moses of victory. The defeat of Og and his army at Edrei is a precursor to the Israelites' eventual settlement in the Promised Land, demonstrating God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Moses, journeying through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/og,_king_of_bashan.htm">Og, King of Bashan</a></b><br>A formidable Amorite king known for his great size and strength, ruling over the region of Bashan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bashan.htm">Bashan</a></b><br>A fertile region east of the Jordan River, known for its strong cities and giant inhabitants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/edrei.htm">Edrei</a></b><br>A significant city in Bashan where the battle between the Israelites and Og took place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>A confrontation initiated by Og against the Israelites, marking another step in Israel's conquest of the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_battles.htm">God's Sovereignty in Battles</a></b><br>The victory over Og demonstrates God's control over seemingly insurmountable challenges.

Og <span class="cmt_word">the</span> king of Bashan. Og was himself of the aboriginal giant race which had left so many remnants, or at least so many memories, in these regions (see on Deuteronomy 2:10-12, 20-23; Joshua 12:4; 13:12); but he is classed with Sihon as a king of the Amorites (<a href="/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10</a>) because his people were chiefly at least of that race. Bashan itself comprised the plain now known as Jaulan and Haulan beyond the Jarmuk (now Mandhur), the largest affluent of the Jordan, which joins it a few miles below the lake of Tiberias. The kingdom of Og, however, extended over the northern and larger part of Gilead, a much more fertile territory than Bashan proper (see on Deuteronomy 3:1-17). <span class="cmt_word">At Edrei.</span> Probably the modern Edhra'ah, or Der'a, situate on a branch of the Jarmuk, some twenty-four miles from Bozrah. The ancient city lies buried beneath the modern village, and was built, like the other cities of Bashan, in the most massive style of architecture. The cities of Og were so strong that the Israelites could not have dispossessed him by any might of their own if he had abode behind his walls. Either confidence in his warlike prowess or some more mysterious cause (see on Joshua 24:12) impelled him to leave his fortifications, and give battle to the Israelites to his own utter defeat. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/21-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then they turned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yip&#772;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
