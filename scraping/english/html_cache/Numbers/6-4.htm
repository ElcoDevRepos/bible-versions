The term "separation" indicates a period of consecration and dedication. This vow could be for a specific time or lifelong, as seen in the cases of Samson (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>), Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>), and John the Baptist (<a href="/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15</a>). The concept of separation is central to the holiness code in Leviticus, where being set apart for God is a recurring theme.<p><b>he is not to eat anything that comes from the grapevine</b><br>The restriction from consuming grape products symbolizes a complete devotion to God, avoiding indulgence in worldly pleasures. Grapevines were abundant in ancient Israel, and wine was a staple in the diet, often associated with joy and celebration (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). By abstaining, the Nazirite demonstrated a willingness to forgo common comforts to focus on spiritual matters. This abstinence can be seen as a type of fasting, a practice that Jesus also engaged in (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>).<p><b>not even the seeds or skins</b><br>This detail emphasizes the thoroughness of the Nazirite's commitment. By avoiding even the smallest parts of the grape, the vow underscores the importance of purity and total dedication. This level of detail reflects the broader biblical principle of avoiding even the appearance of sin (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-22.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:22</a>). The seeds and skins, though minor, represent the completeness of the vow, much like how Jesus taught that even the smallest sin should be avoided (<a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazirite.htm">Nazirite</a></b><br>An individual who takes a special vow of separation to the Lord, which includes abstaining from products of the grapevine, avoiding contact with the dead, and not cutting their hair.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and commandments from God, including the Nazirite vow, which he communicated to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws, including the Nazirite vow, were given as a means of maintaining holiness and dedication to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites received the law, including the instructions for the Nazirite vow, during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where the Nazirite would eventually present offerings at the completion of their vow.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The Nazirite vow symbolizes a life set apart for God.

For as long as the Nazirite vow is in effect, there are no pauses or exceptions. Just as Samson was to be a Nazirite &#8220;from the womb to the day of his death&#8221; (<a href="/judges/13-7.htm">Judges 13:7</a>), and Paul once kept a timed vow until it was complete (<a href="/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>), the phrase reminds us that devotion to God is measured in continuous faithfulness, not occasional bursts. <a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a> repeats the same wording for hair and ceremonial purity, underscoring that every moment of the vow is sacred.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of his separation</b><p>&#8220;Separation&#8221; speaks of being set apart exclusively for the Lord. The same root idea shows up when God tells Israel, &#8220;You are to be holy to Me, for I the LORD am holy&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>) and when Peter echoes it for believers, &#8220;Be holy in all your conduct&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). The Nazirite&#8217;s lifestyle announces to the community that God owns his time, appetites, and appearance during this pledged season. In today&#8217;s terms, believers are also called to live distinctively, &#8220;come out from among them and be separate&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>), not by isolation but by dedicated obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he is not to eat anything that comes from the grapevine</b><p>The restriction is sweeping&#8212;fresh grapes, dried raisins, juice, wine, vinegar, even grape&#8208;based cakes (<a href="/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3</a>). Why target grapes?<p>&#8226; Wine represented celebration and legitimate pleasure (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>), yet it could also dull discernment (<a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>).<p>&#8226; By foregoing every form of it, the Nazirite declared that true joy and strength come directly from God, not from any earthly stimulant.<p>&#8226; The ban paralleled priestly abstinence while on temple duty (<a href="/ezekiel/44-21.htm">Ezekiel 44:21</a>), hinting that the Nazirite entered a priestlike season of heightened service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not even the seeds or skins</b><p>The mandate drills down to the smallest parts of the grape. No nibbling on leftovers, no &#8220;close enough&#8221; compromises. It echoes the principle that &#8220;a little leaven leavens the whole batch&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>) and that small allowances can erode holiness. Jesus used similar language when He warned about inner impurity despite outer cleanliness (<a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>). God&#8217;s standard is thorough: wholehearted consecration cuts off every avenue that might lead back to self-indulgence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/6-4.htm">Numbers 6:4</a> illustrates total devotion. For every single day of the vow, the Nazirite was to live distinctly, forsaking all grape products&#8212;even their tiniest parts&#8212;to signal undiluted reliance on God. The verse teaches that consecration is continuous, visible, and uncompromising, inviting believers today to the same single-minded, joy-filled separation unto the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">From the kernels even to the husk.</span>--The word which is rendered <span class= "ital">kenels </span>is supposed by some to denote sour grapes, and by others the kernels of berries.

The expression is best understood as including anything and everything, however unlikely to be used, connected with the grape. It is clear that the abstinence of the Nazirite extended beyond what might possibly intoxicate to what was simply pleasant to the taste, like raisins, or refreshing, like <span class="accented">charnels.</span> The vine represented, by an easy parable, the tree of carnal delights, which yields to the appetite of men such a variety of satisfactions. So among the Romans the Flamen Dialis might not even touch a vine. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/6-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his separation,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1512;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(niz&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
