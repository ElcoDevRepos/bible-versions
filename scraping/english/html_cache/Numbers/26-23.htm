Issachar's name is often associated with reward or recompense, reflecting Leah's hope for her son's future. The tribe played a significant role in Israel's history, known for their wisdom and understanding of the times (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>). The census in <a href="/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a> was conducted as the Israelites prepared to enter the Promised Land, ensuring each tribe's inheritance was proportionate to its population.<p><b>The Tolaite clan from Tola:</b><br>Tola was the firstborn son of Issachar, and his descendants formed the Tolaite clan. Tola's name means "worm" or "scarlet," possibly indicating humility or a connection to the dye industry, which was significant in ancient times. Tola later became a judge of Israel, serving for 23 years (<a href="/judges/10.htm">Judges 10:1-2</a>). His leadership helped stabilize Israel during a period of unrest, highlighting the ongoing influence of Issachar's descendants.<p><b>The Punite clan from Puvah:</b><br>Puvah, also known as Puah, was another son of Issachar, and his descendants formed the Punite clan. The name Puvah means "splendid" or "mouth," suggesting a role in communication or leadership. The Punites, like other clans of Issachar, contributed to the tribe's reputation for wisdom and strategic insight. This clan's mention in the census underscores the importance of each family unit in maintaining the social and spiritual fabric of Israel as they prepared to settle in Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_issachar.htm">Sons of Issachar</a></b><br>The verse refers to the descendants of Issachar, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

By listing Issachar&#8217;s &#8220;descendants&#8230;by their clans,&#8221; the Spirit-inspired text confirms that the people standing at the edge of Canaan were the true physical heirs of the patriarchs God had promised to bless (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>; 46:13). This meticulous roll call also prepared the nation for fair land allotment once they entered the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/19-17.htm">Joshua 19:17-23</a>). Because the first census thirty-eight years earlier had already numbered Issachar (<a href="/numbers/1-28.htm">Numbers 1:28-29</a>), the repetition here demonstrates God&#8217;s faithfulness: despite wilderness deaths, the tribe survived and even increased (<a href="/numbers/26-25.htm">Numbers 26:25</a>). Every name underscores the covenant-keeping character of the Lord who preserves His people generation after generation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Tolaite clan from Tola, the Punite clan from Puvah</b><p>The verse names two of Issachar&#8217;s four clan-founders (the Iobites and Shimronites appear in verse 24). Moses traces each clan straight back to a son of Issachar (<a href="/genesis/46-13.htm">Genesis 46:13</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/7-1.htm">1 Chronicles 7:1</a>), showing an unbroken line from Jacob to the new generation.<p>&#8226; Tolaite clan&#8212;descended from Tola; centuries later a man of this line, Tola son of Puah, rose to judge Israel (<a href="/judges/10-1.htm">Judges 10:1-2</a>), illustrating how God would continue to raise leaders from faithful tribes.<p>&#8226; Punite clan&#8212;descended from Puvah (called &#8220;Puah&#8221; in <a href="/1_chronicles/7-1.htm">1 Chronicles 7:1</a>). The clan&#8217;s mention, though brief, affirms that no portion of God&#8217;s people is overlooked; each receives a place in the inheritance (<a href="/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14-17</a> highlights similar concern for equal distribution).<p>By cataloging clans, the passage also warns against spiritual drift: those who belong to God must remain distinct within their family line, just as each clan remained identifiable within the larger nation (<a href="/numbers/26-53.htm">Numbers 26:53-55</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/26-23.htm">Numbers 26:23</a> affirms that the tribe of Issachar had tangible, traceable roots in two specific clans&#8212;the Tolaite and Punite&#8212;demonstrating God&#8217;s precise preservation of His covenant family. The verse prepares Israel for land inheritance, highlights the reliability of God&#8217;s promises across generations, and reminds every believer that the Lord knows and values each member of His people by name.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sons of Issachar.</span> As in <a href="/genesis/46-13.htm">Genesis 46:13</a>;
