The mention of his father, Ammihud, which means "people of glory," situates Shemuel within a lineage that values divine connection and honor. This lineage is significant in the context of Israel's tribal organization, where family heritage played a crucial role in identity and leadership. The genealogical record underscores the importance of family and tribal affiliations in the distribution of the Promised Land.<p><b>from the tribe of Simeon</b><br>The tribe of Simeon, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Simeon, the second son of Jacob and Leah. Historically, Simeon was known for its close association with the tribe of Judah, often sharing territory in the southern part of Canaan. This connection is evident in the allocation of land, where Simeon's inheritance was within the territory of Judah (<a href="/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>). The tribe's history includes moments of both prominence and decline, reflecting the broader narrative of Israel's journey and covenant relationship with God. The inclusion of a representative from Simeon in the land allocation process highlights the tribe's continued role in the unfolding story of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeon.htm">Simeon</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Simeon, the second son of Jacob and Leah.
