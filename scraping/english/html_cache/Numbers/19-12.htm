The "water" mentioned is the water of purification, which includes the ashes of a red heifer, cedarwood, hyssop, and scarlet yarn (<a href="/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19:1-10</a>). The use of the red heifer is unique in the Old Testament and is seen as a type of Christ, symbolizing His sacrifice and the cleansing from sin. The third and seventh days are significant in biblical numerology; the number three often represents completeness or divine perfection, while seven symbolizes spiritual perfection and completion. This purification process underscores the importance of ritual cleanliness in maintaining holiness and the community's purity.<p><b>then he will be clean.</b><br>The result of following the prescribed purification process is ceremonial cleanliness, allowing the individual to rejoin the community and participate in religious activities. This reflects the broader biblical theme of separation from sin and the need for atonement to restore fellowship with God. The concept of being "clean" is not just physical but also spiritual, pointing to the need for inner purity. This anticipates the New Testament teaching on the cleansing power of Jesus' blood, which purifies believers from sin (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>).<p><b>But if he does not purify himself on the third and seventh days,</b><br>Failure to adhere to the purification process results in continued uncleanness. This highlights the seriousness of disobedience to God's commands and the consequences of neglecting divine instructions. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, uncleanness was not just a personal issue but affected the entire community, as it could lead to defilement of the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>). This underscores the communal aspect of sin and the need for corporate holiness.<p><b>he will not be clean.</b><br>The consequence of not following the purification ritual is a state of perpetual uncleanness, which has both spiritual and social implications. This serves as a warning about the dangers of ignoring God's laws and the importance of obedience. In a broader theological context, it points to the necessity of Christ's atoning work for true purification, as human efforts alone are insufficient for achieving spiritual cleanliness. This foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on faith in Christ as the means of being made clean before God (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unclean_person.htm">The Unclean Person</a></b><br>This refers to anyone who has come into contact with a dead body, which rendered them ceremonially unclean according to the Law of Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_water_of_purification.htm">The Water of Purification</a></b><br>A special mixture made with the ashes of a red heifer, cedarwood, hyssop, and scarlet yarn, used for ceremonial cleansing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_third_and_seventh_days.htm">The Third and Seventh Days</a></b><br>Specific days designated for the purification process, emphasizing the importance of obedience and timing in the cleansing ritual.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp_of_israel.htm">The Camp of Israel</a></b><br>The community setting where these laws were practiced, highlighting the communal aspect of purity and holiness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Leaders who communicated God's laws to the Israelites, ensuring that the community adhered to God's standards of holiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The specific instructions for purification highlight the necessity of following God's commands precisely.
