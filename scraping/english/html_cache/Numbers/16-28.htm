This moment occurs during a rebellion led by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram against Moses' leadership. Moses, as a prophet and leader, often communicated God's will to the people, and his words here are meant to affirm his divine appointment.<p><b>&#8220;This is how you will know</b><br>Moses is about to provide evidence of his divine commission. In biblical narratives, signs and wonders often serve as confirmation of God's presence and authority. This phrase sets the stage for a divine act that will validate Moses' leadership and God's choice.<p><b>that the LORD has sent me</b><br>Moses emphasizes that his authority comes from the LORD, the covenant name of God, indicating a personal and relational deity who is actively involved in the affairs of His people. This assertion is crucial in distinguishing Moses' leadership from self-appointed authority.<p><b>to do all these things,</b><br>Refers to the leadership tasks and decisions Moses has undertaken, including leading the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness. This phrase underscores that Moses' actions are not self-motivated but are in obedience to God's commands.<p><b>for it was not my own doing:</b><br>Moses clarifies that his leadership and the miraculous events surrounding the Israelites are not due to his own power or ambition. This humility is a key characteristic of biblical leaders, who often attribute their success to God's intervention.
