The use of oxen, which were valuable animals, signifies the importance and sincerity of the offering. Oxen were often used in sacrifices due to their size and value, symbolizing strength and service. This offering reflects the communal aspect of worship in Israel, where the offering was shared among the priests, the offerer, and God.<p><b>five rams</b><br>Rams were commonly used in sacrificial offerings and symbolized leadership and strength. The number five can represent grace or God's goodness in biblical numerology. The inclusion of rams in the peace offering highlights the completeness and abundance of the offering, as well as the offerer's desire to honor God fully.<p><b>five male goats</b><br>Goats were often used in sin offerings, but here they are part of a peace offering, indicating a desire for reconciliation and peace with God. The male goats, being unblemished, represent purity and the removal of sin. The number five again emphasizes the grace and favor sought from God.<p><b>and five male lambs a year old</b><br>Lambs, especially those a year old, were considered ideal for sacrifices due to their innocence and purity. They are often seen as a type of Christ, the Lamb of God, who was sacrificed for the sins of the world. The repetition of the number five underscores the completeness and grace of the offering.<p><b>This was the offering of Ahira son of Enan.</b><br>Ahira, the leader of the tribe of Naphtali, presents this offering on behalf of his tribe. Each tribal leader brought identical offerings over twelve days, symbolizing unity and equality among the tribes of Israel. Ahira's offering, like those of the other leaders, demonstrates obedience and devotion to God, as well as a desire for communal peace and blessing. The mention of his lineage, "son of Enan," emphasizes the importance of family and heritage in Israelite society.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahira_son_of_enan.htm">Ahira son of Enan</a></b><br>Ahira is the leader of the tribe of Naphtali, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.
