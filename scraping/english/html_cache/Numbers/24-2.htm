His looking up signifies a moment of divine revelation, indicating a shift from his previous attempts to curse Israel. This act of looking up can symbolize readiness to receive a message from God, similar to other biblical figures who look up in moments of divine encounter (e.g., Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>).<p><b>and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe</b><br>The encampment of Israel tribe by tribe reflects the organized structure of the Israelite community as described in earlier chapters of Numbers. This arrangement underscores the unity and order of God's people, reminiscent of the military and familial organization seen in <a href="/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>. The sight of Israel's orderly encampment may have been a visual reminder of God's covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding their descendants.<p><b>the Spirit of God came upon him</b><br>The Spirit of God coming upon Balaam is a significant moment, as it indicates divine intervention and control over Balaam's prophetic utterance. This phrase highlights the sovereignty of God in using even a pagan prophet to bless His people. The Spirit's involvement is similar to other instances in the Old Testament where individuals are empowered to speak or act according to God's will, such as the judges in the Book of Judges. This moment foreshadows the New Testament outpouring of the Holy Spirit, which empowers believers to proclaim God's truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who is hired by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse the Israelites.

His sight will now align with that reality.<p>&#8226; The seer beholds the people whom God calls &#8220;My son&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>), a corporate testimony that even enemies must acknowledge (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>encamped tribe by tribe</b><p>Israel is &#8220;encamped tribe by tribe&#8221; (24:2 c).<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a> details this precise layout&#8212;three tribes on each side of the tabernacle, Judah leading the east.<p>&#8226; The orderly camp reflects God&#8217;s nature: &#8220;For God is not a God of disorder but of peace&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p>&#8226; From Balaam&#8217;s elevated viewpoint, the camp likely formed a massive cross-shaped arrangement surrounding the dwelling place of God, foreshadowing redemption that confounds every curse (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Balak hoped a disheveled rabble could be cursed; instead, Balaam sees an organized, covenant army ready to enter the land (<a href="/numbers/10-14.htm">Numbers 10:14&#8211;28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Spirit of God came upon him</b><p>&#8220;The Spirit of God came upon him&#8221; (24:2 d).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Spirit overrides Balaam&#8217;s pagan practice, ensuring only blessing proceeds (<a href="/numbers/23-12.htm">Numbers 23:12</a>). Similar episodes: Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>), Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>), Amasai (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>).<p>&#8226; This demonstrates inspiration: &#8220;No prophecy was ever brought about by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase shows divine sovereignty&#8212;God can use even an unwilling prophet to proclaim truth (<a href="/jonah/3-1.htm">Jonah 3:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; The Spirit&#8217;s coming authenticates the message that follows, a blessing that climaxes in the star and scepter prophecy of Messiah (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>), confirming the irrevocable nature of God&#8217;s promises (<a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/24-2.htm">Numbers 24:2</a> captures a dramatic turning point: Balaam raises his eyes, sees God&#8217;s covenant people arranged in holy order, and is overtaken by the Spirit.
