Instead, they were allocated cities within the territories of the other tribes. This ensured their presence and influence throughout Israel, facilitating their religious and educational duties. The number six is significant in biblical numerology, often representing imperfection or incompleteness, which contrasts with the divine perfection symbolized by the number seven.<p><b>are to be appointed as cities of refuge,</b><br>Cities of refuge were established as part of the Mosaic Law to provide sanctuary for individuals who committed unintentional manslaughter. This legal provision underscored the value of human life and the importance of justice tempered with mercy. The concept of refuge is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing God's protection and grace.<p><b>to which a manslayer may flee.</b><br>The term "manslayer" refers specifically to someone who has killed another unintentionally, distinguishing them from a murderer who acts with malice aforethought. The cities of refuge offered protection from the avenger of blood, a family member seeking retribution. This provision reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of blood vengeance, which was common in tribal societies. Theologically, it points to the need for a mediator and a place of safety, prefiguring Christ as our refuge.<p><b>In addition to these,</b><br>This phrase indicates that the cities of refuge were part of a larger allocation of cities to the Levites. It emphasizes the dual role of these cities as both places of refuge and centers of Levitical ministry.<p><b>give the Levites forty-two other cities.</b><br>The total number of Levitical cities was forty-eight, including the six cities of refuge. This distribution ensured that the Levites were integrated throughout the land, maintaining their role as spiritual leaders and teachers. The number forty-two, while not as symbolically significant as some other biblical numbers, contributes to the overall structure and organization of the Israelite community. The presence of the Levites in these cities facilitated the teaching of the Law and the maintenance of worship practices, serving as a constant reminder of Israel's covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The tribe of Levi, set apart for religious duties and service to God.
