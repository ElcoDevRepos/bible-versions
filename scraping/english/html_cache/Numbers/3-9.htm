This assignment highlights the special role of the Levites in the religious life of Israel. The tribe of Levi was chosen by God for this purpose, as seen in <a href="/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26-29</a>, where the Levites stood with Moses during the incident of the golden calf. This assignment underscores the importance of order and structure in worship, as well as the need for dedicated individuals to support the priestly functions.<p><b>they have been given exclusively to him</b><br>The exclusivity of the Levites' service to Aaron and his sons emphasizes the sanctity and specificity of their role. This exclusivity is a reflection of God's sovereign choice and the principle of divine election, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture. The Levites were not to be involved in other tribal duties or inheritances, as their inheritance was the Lord Himself (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>). This mirrors the New Testament concept of believers being set apart for God's purposes (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>from among the Israelites.</b><br>The Levites were chosen from among the Israelites, signifying that they were part of the larger community but had a distinct role within it. This selection from among the people illustrates the idea of being in the world but set apart for God's service, a concept that is echoed in the New Testament for the Church (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-19</a>). The Levites' role as mediators between God and the Israelites foreshadows the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ, who is both fully God and fully man, chosen from among humanity to be the High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service to the Tabernacle.

The Levites are not volunteers or self-appointed helpers; they are purposefully placed under Aaron&#8217;s leadership.<p>&#8226; Earlier, God said, &#8220;Bring the tribe of Levi near and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6</a>). The pattern is unmistakable: God chooses, Moses obeys, and the Levites serve.<p>&#8226; This assignment safeguards worship. Just as priests alone could handle the altar (<a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12-13</a>), Levites exclusively cared for the tabernacle&#8217;s hardware (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By establishing clear roles, God preserves order&#8212;echoing Paul&#8217;s later reminder that &#8220;God is not a God of disorder but of peace&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Given exclusively to him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;They have been given exclusively to him&#8221; underscores a transfer of ownership. The Levites belong to Yahweh first and are then presented as a gift to Aaron (<a href="/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>).<p>&#8226; This mirrors the way Israel itself is God&#8217;s &#8220;treasured possession&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>), yet God places portions of that possession into distinct service.<p>&#8226; The Levites&#8217; exclusivity protects holiness: only those appointed may approach sacred things (<a href="/numbers/18-3.htm">Numbers 18:3-7</a>). When Korah&#8217;s rebels challenged that boundary, judgment fell swiftly (<a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1-35</a>).<p>&#8226; New-covenant believers see a parallel in Christ giving &#8220;apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers&#8221; to the church (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>); God still appoints people for specialized ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From among the Israelites</b><p>&#8226; God does not import outsiders; He selects servants &#8220;from among the Israelites.&#8221; Every tribe contributes spiritually through the Levites&#8217; ministry.<p>&#8226; This choice replaces the firstborn sons originally claimed at Passover (<a href="/numbers/8-16.htm">Numbers 8:16-18</a>; <a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>). God graciously spares the firstborn but still requires devoted representatives.<p>&#8226; The Levites remain Israelites&#8212;with inheritance in God, though no land allotment (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-2</a>). Their dependence on tithes keeps their focus on tabernacle service rather than agriculture or commerce.<p>&#8226; Likewise, Peter calls all believers &#8220;a royal priesthood&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), yet within that larger priesthood God still sets apart particular functions for the good of the whole body (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/3-9.htm">Numbers 3:9</a> shows God&#8217;s orderly design for worship: He handpicks the Levites, gifts them to Aaronic priests, and sets them apart from the rest of Israel. This exclusive arrangement safeguards holiness, prevents confusion, and supplies every need of the tabernacle. The passage reminds us that God still appoints specific people for dedicated service, all to bless His entire covenant community.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">They are wholly given unto him.</span>--Hebrew, <span class= "ital">Given, given are they to him. </span>This repetition of the word <span class= "ital">nethunim </span>(given) is emphatic.
