The tribute mentioned here refers to a portion of the spoils taken from the Midianites, which were to be given to the priestly class. Eleazar, the son of Aaron, served as the high priest at this time, succeeding his father. This act of giving the tribute to Eleazar underscores the role of the priesthood in mediating between God and the people, as well as maintaining the sanctity of the offerings. The priesthood was central to Israelite worship and religious life, and this tribute would support their service in the tabernacle.<p><b>as an offering for the LORD</b><br>The tribute given to Eleazar was not merely a gift to the priest but was considered an offering to the LORD. This reflects the understanding that all victories and spoils were ultimately due to God's provision and blessing. Offerings were a way to acknowledge God's sovereignty and express gratitude. In the broader biblical context, offerings were a key component of worship, symbolizing dedication and submission to God. This particular offering was a tangible acknowledgment of God's role in the victory over the Midianites.<p><b>as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's commands. Throughout the Pentateuch, Moses is depicted as a faithful servant who follows God's instructions precisely. The command to give a portion of the spoils as an offering was part of the divine instructions given to Moses, highlighting the necessity of adhering to God's will. This obedience is a recurring theme in the Bible, illustrating the blessings that come from following God's commands and the consequences of disobedience. Moses' compliance serves as a model for the Israelites and for believers, demonstrating the importance of faithfulness to God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
