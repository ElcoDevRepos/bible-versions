This reflects a careful and strategic approach to warfare, emphasizing the importance of gathering intelligence. Jazer was a city east of the Jordan River, in the territory later allotted to the tribe of Gad. The sending of spies indicates the significance of Jazer as a strategic location for Israel's conquest and settlement.<p><b>Israel captured its villages</b><br>The capture of Jazer and its villages demonstrates Israel's growing military strength and God's fulfillment of His promise to give them the land. This victory is part of a series of conquests that establish Israel's presence east of the Jordan. The term "villages" suggests that the area was not just a single city but a region with multiple settlements, indicating a significant territorial gain.<p><b>and drove out the Amorites who were there</b><br>The Amorites were a prominent Canaanite people known for their fortified cities and military prowess. Driving them out signifies a decisive victory and the removal of a significant obstacle to Israel's settlement in the Promised Land. This act of driving out the Amorites fulfills God's command to dispossess the inhabitants of the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>) and prefigures the ultimate conquest of Canaan.
