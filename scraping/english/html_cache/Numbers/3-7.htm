The "him" in this context is Aaron, the high priest. The Levites were chosen by God to serve in a special capacity, highlighting the importance of divine selection and service in the community of Israel. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God appointing specific individuals or groups for particular roles, as seen with the selection of the apostles in the New Testament.<p><b>and for the whole congregation</b><br>The Levites' service was not only for Aaron but also for the entire Israelite community. This underscores the communal aspect of worship and service in Israel, where the actions of a few had implications for the many. It reflects the interconnectedness of the community, where the spiritual well-being of the nation was supported by the faithful service of the Levites. This communal responsibility is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to serve one another in love.<p><b>before the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites. It was a portable sanctuary used during the wilderness wanderings. The Levites' service "before the Tent of Meeting" signifies their role in maintaining the sanctity and functionality of this sacred space. The Tabernacle is a type of Christ, as it represents God's dwelling among His people, a theme fulfilled in the incarnation of Jesus (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>attending to the service of the tabernacle</b><br>The Levites were responsible for various tasks related to the Tabernacle, including its assembly, disassembly, and transportation, as well as assisting in the rituals and sacrifices. This service was crucial for the proper worship of God and the spiritual life of Israel. The meticulous care for the Tabernacle reflects the holiness and orderliness required in approaching God. This concept is mirrored in the New Testament, where believers are called to be living temples, serving God with reverence and dedication (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart by God to serve in the tabernacle, assisting the priests and performing various duties related to worship and the maintenance of the sacred space.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, brother of Moses, and a central figure in the establishment of the priestly duties and the Levitical order.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting (Tabernacle)</a></b><br>The portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where the Levites and priests performed their sacred duties.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_congregation_of_israel.htm">The Congregation of Israel</a></b><br>The collective body of the Israelites, for whom the Levites performed their duties, ensuring that the worship and service to God were conducted properly.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_service_of_the_tabernacle.htm">The Service of the Tabernacle</a></b><br>The various tasks and responsibilities associated with the upkeep and rituals of the tabernacle, including sacrifices, offerings, and maintaining the holy items.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_service_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Service in Worship</a></b><br>The Levites' role highlights the importance of service in worship.
