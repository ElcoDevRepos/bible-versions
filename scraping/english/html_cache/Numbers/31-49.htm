In the context of <a href="/numbers/31.htm">Numbers 31</a>, the leaders of the Israelite army are addressing Moses after returning from battle. This reflects the hierarchical structure of communication in ancient Israel, where leaders would report to their superiors, in this case, Moses, who was the mediator between God and the people.<p><b>&#8220;Your servants</b><br>The term "servants" here denotes humility and submission to authority. It reflects the cultural norm of showing respect to leaders and acknowledging one's role within the community. In biblical times, referring to oneself as a servant was a way to express loyalty and dedication, especially in the context of serving God and His appointed leaders.<p><b>have counted the soldiers under our command,</b><br>Counting the soldiers indicates a careful accounting and responsibility for those under one's leadership. This practice was common in military contexts to ensure that all were accounted for after a battle. It also reflects the importance of order and organization within the Israelite camp, as seen in other instances where censuses were taken (e.g., <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1 and 26</a>).<p><b>and not one of us is missing.</b><br>This miraculous outcome highlights divine protection and favor. In the context of ancient warfare, it was highly unusual for an entire army to return without any casualties. This phrase underscores God's providence and faithfulness to His people, fulfilling His promises of protection when they obey His commands. It also serves as a testament to the Israelites' faith and obedience, as seen in other biblical narratives where God grants victory and safety to His people (e.g., <a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2-5</a>, the fall of Jericho). This can be seen as a type of Christ, who ensures the spiritual safety and eternal security of His followers, as none of those given to Him by the Father will be lost (<a href="/john/6-39.htm">John 6:39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who was commanded by God to take vengeance on the Midianites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_soldiers.htm">Israelite Soldiers</a></b><br>The men who went to battle against the Midianites and returned without any losses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>A people who were enemies of Israel and were defeated in this battle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar_the_priest.htm">Eleazar the Priest</a></b><br>The priest who was involved in the purification process after the battle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plains_of_moab.htm">Plains of Moab</a></b><br>The location where the Israelites were camped during this event.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection.htm">Divine Protection</a></b><br>God&#8217;s protection is evident as not one soldier was lost.

The Midianites were probably attacked in an unprepared and defenceless state. After due allowance, however, has been made for all these circumstances, the fact that not a single Israelitish warrior perished can be satisfactorily explained only on the supposition that God vouchsafed to grant to His people miraculous aid and protection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There lacketh not one man of us.</span> The officers naturally regarded this as a very wonderful circumstance; and so indeed it was, whether Midian made any resistance or not. It was, however, in strict keeping with the promises of that temporal dispensation. It would have been no satisfaction to the Israelite who fell upon the threshold of the promised land to know that victory remained with his comrades. His was not the courage of modern soldiers, who fling away their lives in blind confidence that some advantage will accrue thereby to the army at large; rather, he fought under the conviction that to each, as well as to all, life and victory were pledged upon condition of obedience and courage. In this case no one was found unfaithful, and therefore no one was allowed to fall. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/31-49.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
