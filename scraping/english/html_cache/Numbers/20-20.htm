Despite this familial connection, Edom refused Israel passage through their land. This refusal highlights the longstanding tension between the two nations, rooted in the sibling rivalry of Esau and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). The Edomites' insistence reflects their fear of the large number of Israelites and a desire to protect their territory. This incident fulfills the prophecy given to Rebekah that two nations would be divided from her womb (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>).<p><b>And they came out to confront the Israelites with a large army</b><br>Edom's mobilization of a large army indicates the seriousness with which they viewed the potential threat of Israel's passage. This military response underscores the geopolitical realities of the time, where territorial integrity was fiercely protected. The presence of a large army also suggests that Edom was a formidable power in the region, capable of defending its borders against a significant threat.<p><b>and a strong hand.</b><br>The phrase "a strong hand" implies not only military might but also a firm resolve. This expression is often used in the Bible to denote power and authority, as seen in God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt "with a mighty hand" (<a href="/exodus/6.htm">Exodus 6:1</a>). Here, it emphasizes Edom's determination to enforce their decision, regardless of familial ties. This confrontation serves as a reminder of the challenges Israel faced in their journey to the Promised Land and foreshadows future conflicts with surrounding nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother.
