The inhabitants of the land were the Canaanites, who were known for their idolatrous practices and moral corruption. The driving out of these inhabitants was not merely a military conquest but a spiritual cleansing to prevent the Israelites from being influenced by pagan practices. This command is consistent with earlier instructions found in <a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31-33</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>, emphasizing the need for separation from ungodly influences. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of the Christian's call to separate from sin and worldly influences, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>.<p><b>destroy all their carved images and cast idols</b><br>The destruction of carved images and idols was crucial to prevent the Israelites from falling into idolatry, which was prevalent among the Canaanites. These idols were often representations of their gods, such as Baal and Asherah, and were made from wood, stone, or metal. The command to destroy them underscores the importance of worshiping the one true God and avoiding syncretism. This aligns with the first and second commandments given in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>. Theologically, this can be seen as a call to remove anything that takes the place of God in one's life, echoing the New Testament teaching in 1 <a href="/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a> to keep oneself from idols.<p><b>and demolish all their high places</b><br>High places were elevated sites used for worship, often associated with pagan rituals and sacrifices. These locations were significant in Canaanite religion and were often used to worship deities other than Yahweh. The command to demolish them was to ensure that the Israelites would not be tempted to adopt these practices. This is reiterated in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>, where God instructs the Israelites to destroy all places where the nations served their gods. Theologically, this can be seen as a call to eliminate any form of false worship and to ensure that worship is directed solely to God, as emphasized in <a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>, where worship must be in spirit and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being instructed to take possession of the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, inhabited by various pagan nations at the time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/carved_images_and_cast_idols.htm">Carved Images and Cast Idols</a></b><br>Representations of false gods worshiped by the Canaanites, which the Israelites are commanded to destroy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places.htm">High Places</a></b><br>Elevated sites used for pagan worship, which were common in Canaan and needed to be demolished.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is conveying God's instructions to the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_purity.htm">Spiritual Purity</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were commanded to remove all forms of idolatry, Christians today are called to remove anything that takes the place of God in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god.htm">Obedience to God</a></b><br>The Israelites' success in the Promised Land depended on their obedience to God's commands.

The Septuagint translates Bamoth in both places by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and of course it was not the high places themselves, which were simply certain prominent elevations, but the monuments (of whatever kind) which superstition had erected upon them, which were to be plucked down. As a fact, it would seem that the Jews, instead of obeying this command, appropriated the Bamoth to their own religious uses (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-58.htm">Psalm 78:58</a>, etc.). The natural result was, as in all similar cases, that not only the Bamoth, but very many of the superstitions and idolatries connected with them, were taken over into the service of the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/33-52.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">you must drive out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1436;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;ra&#353;&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
