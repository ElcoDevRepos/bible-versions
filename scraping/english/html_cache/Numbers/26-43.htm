This phrase highlights the importance of tribal identity in ancient Israel, where lineage determined one's place in society and religious life. The Shuhamites, as part of the tribe of Dan, were allocated specific territories in the Promised Land, which played a role in the fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham regarding the land. The tribe of Dan is often associated with both positive and negative aspects in biblical history, including their role in the conquest of Canaan and later idolatry (Judges 18).<p><b>and their registration numbered 64,400</b><br>This census was conducted as the Israelites prepared to enter the Promised Land, marking a new generation after the wilderness wanderings. The number 64,400 reflects the growth and strength of the Shuhamite clans, indicating God's blessing and faithfulness in preserving His people despite previous judgments. This census was crucial for organizing the military and dividing the land among the tribes. The specific number also underscores the meticulous record-keeping and orderliness that characterized the Israelite community, as seen in other census accounts in the Pentateuch.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shuham.htm">Shuham</a></b><br>Shuham is a descendant of Dan, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.
