This area was significant as the final encampment of the Israelites before entering the Promised Land. Moab was a territory inhabited by the descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, and often had a contentious relationship with Israel. The plains served as a strategic location for the Israelites to prepare for their conquest of Canaan.<p><b>by the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River is a critical geographical feature in biblical history, serving as a boundary for the Promised Land. It symbolizes transition and new beginnings, as the Israelites would soon cross it to enter Canaan. The river is also significant in the New Testament, where John the Baptist baptized Jesus, marking the start of His public ministry.<p><b>across from Jericho</b><br>Jericho is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world and the first city conquered by the Israelites in Canaan. Its location across from the Israelites' camp highlights the imminent fulfillment of God's promise to give them the land. The fall of Jericho, as described in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>, demonstrates God's power and faithfulness.<p><b>the LORD said to Moses</b><br>This phrase underscores the direct communication between God and Moses, a central theme in the Pentateuch.

The verse stresses location (God&#8217;s faithfulness), boundary (a decisive step of faith), opposition in view (dependence on divine power), divine authority (the Lord&#8217;s commands), and ordained leadership (Moses as mediator).
