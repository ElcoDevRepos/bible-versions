The spoils were divided into two equal parts: one for the warriors who fought in the battle and one for the rest of the community. This division underscores the communal nature of Israelite society, where even those who did not directly participate in battle shared in the victory.<p><b>Moses took one out of every fifty persons and animals</b><br>Moses, as the leader and mediator between God and the people, was responsible for ensuring that the spoils were distributed according to divine instruction. The specific ratio of one out of fifty indicates a tithe-like offering, which was a common practice in ancient Israel to support religious functions and the priesthood. This reflects the principle of dedicating a portion of one's resources to God, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and gave them to the Levites</b><br>The Levites were the tribe set apart for religious duties and the service of the tabernacle. They did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes, so they relied on the offerings and tithes from the people for their sustenance. This allocation from the spoils ensured that the Levites could continue their sacred duties without distraction, highlighting the importance of supporting those who serve in religious capacities.<p><b>who kept charge of the tabernacle of the LORD</b><br>The tabernacle was the portable sanctuary where God's presence dwelled among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The Levites were responsible for its care, transport, and the conduct of worship within it. This role was crucial for maintaining the spiritual life of the nation and ensuring that the covenant relationship with God was upheld.<p><b>as the LORD had commanded him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Moses' obedience to God's instructions. Throughout the Pentateuch, Moses is portrayed as a faithful servant who carries out God's commands precisely. This obedience is a model for the Israelites and for believers, illustrating the importance of following divine guidance in all aspects of life. It also underscores the authority of God's word and the necessity of adhering to it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is overseeing the distribution of the spoils of war.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar_the_priest.htm">Eleazar the Priest</a></b><br>The son of Aaron, who assists Moses in religious duties and the distribution process.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who have just returned from a victorious battle against the Midianites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>The tribe set apart for religious duties, who receive a portion of the spoils.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_midianites.htm">The Midianites</a></b><br>The people defeated by the Israelites, whose possessions are being divided.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_fairness.htm">Stewardship and Fairness</a></b><br>The division of spoils among the Israelites and the Levites teaches us about the importance of fair distribution and stewardship of resources.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/support_for_ministry.htm">Support for Ministry</a></b><br>The allocation to the Levites underscores the need to support those dedicated to spiritual service.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' adherence to God's instructions through Moses reflects the importance of obedience in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_sharing.htm">Community and Sharing</a></b><br>The communal aspect of sharing resources highlights the value of community and mutual support among believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>This passage reminds us of God's provision and faithfulness in supplying the needs of His people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_31_47_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 31:47?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_31_47_Levites_provision.htm">How does Numbers 31:47 illustrate God's provision for the Levites' service?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_leadership_from_Moses_6.htm">What can we learn about leadership from Moses' actions in Numbers 31:47?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Numbers_31_47_to_tithing_concept.htm">How does Numbers 31:47 connect to the concept of tithing in Scripture?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_aid_church_leaders_biblically.htm">In what ways can we support church leaders, reflecting Numbers 31:47's principles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Resource_sharing_in_community_today.htm">How does sharing resources in Numbers 31:47 apply to our community involvement today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_allocate_war_spoils_to_Levites.htm">Why did Moses allocate spoils of war to the Levites in Numbers 31:47?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_31_47_God_s_justice_and_mercy.htm">How does Numbers 31:47 reflect God's justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_do_Levites_get_a_share_in_Num_31_47.htm">What is the significance of the Levites receiving a portion in Numbers 31:47?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_numbers_31.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Numbers 31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/can_history_science_confirm_tabernacle_manpower.htm">Numbers 4 -
