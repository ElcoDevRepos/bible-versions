Scarlet often represents sin and sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where sins are described as scarlet. In the context of the tabernacle, the scarlet cloth covering the sacred objects signifies the need for atonement and the covering of sin. The color also points to the blood of sacrifices, which foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood covers the sins of humanity. The act of spreading the cloth indicates a careful and respectful handling of holy items, emphasizing the sacredness of the tabernacle's furnishings.<p><b>cover them with fine leather</b><br>The fine leather, often translated as "porpoise" or "badger skins" in other versions, served as a protective covering for the sacred objects during transport. This layer of protection highlights the importance of preserving the holiness and integrity of the tabernacle's items. The use of durable materials reflects the practical needs of the Israelites as they journeyed through the wilderness. Theologically, this covering can be seen as a type of Christ, who shields and protects believers, ensuring their sanctity and security.<p><b>and insert the poles</b><br>The insertion of poles for carrying the sacred objects underscores the mobility of the tabernacle, which was designed to be transported as the Israelites moved. This method of transport ensured that the holy items were not touched directly, maintaining their sanctity. The poles also symbolize the readiness and willingness to follow God's guidance, as the Israelites were led by the cloud and fire. This practice connects to the Ark of the Covenant, which was also carried with poles, as described in <a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14</a>, emphasizing the reverence and care required in handling divine matters.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kohathites.htm">The Kohathites</a></b><br>A Levitical family responsible for the care of the most sacred objects of the tabernacle, including the Ark of the Covenant, the table of showbread, and other holy furnishings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness.

The color immediately calls to mind the vivid imagery of redemption&#8212;blood that atones, life given for life. When Isaiah reminds Israel, &#8220;Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be white as snow&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>), he uses the same hue to point toward cleansing. <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a> says Christ entered the Most Holy Place &#8220;by His own blood, thus securing eternal redemption.&#8221; The scarlet covering quietly preaches that same gospel centuries earlier.<p>&#8226; Practically, the cloth also hides the holy articles from casual view during transport, honoring the warning in <a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a> that the Kohathites must not touch or see the sacred objects lest they die. Holiness is not a theory&#8212;it is a real boundary God lovingly sets.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cover them with fine leather</b><p>&#8226; After the scarlet cloth comes &#8220;fine leather,&#8221; a durable hide (compare <a href="/exodus/26-14.htm">Exodus 26:14</a>). The first covering speaks of redemption; this outer layer speaks of protection. Out in the wilderness sun, sand, and wind, the leather keeps the costly vessels safe. <a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5&#8211;6</a> echoes the idea: &#8220;The LORD is your keeper&#8230; the sun will not strike you by day.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people today still live under His layered care&#8212;saved by Christ&#8217;s blood, shielded by His faithful guardianship (<a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>). The text invites us to recognize both realities: our sin forgiven and our walk preserved.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Insert the poles</b><p>&#8226; Only after everything is covered do the priests slide the poles into the rings, preparing the table for travel. <a href="/exodus/25-13.htm">Exodus 25:13&#8211;15</a> established this method so that no human hand would ever touch the holy article itself. When <a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6&#8211;7</a> records Uzzah&#8217;s tragedy for steadying the Ark, it underscores the point: God&#8217;s instructions are not ceremonial extras but life-and-death directives.<p>&#8226; The poles also hint at God&#8217;s heart to move with His people. The tabernacle was never meant to be static; its mobility foreshadows the indwelling presence of the Spirit who now travels with every believer (<a href="/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/4-8.htm">Numbers 4:8</a> blends symbolism and practicality. The scarlet cloth proclaims redemption, the leather testifies to divine protection, and the poles remind us of holy order and God&#8217;s nearness on the journey. Obeying each detail keeps the focus where it belongs&#8212;on a holy God who saves, shields, and stays with His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And cover the same.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and cover it </span>(the table).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall put in the staves thereof.</span> This formula is repeated alike with reference to the ark, the table, and the two altars. It would therefore be natural to suppose that the staves had all been taken out while the various coverings were put on. On the other hand, it is expressly directed in <a href="/exodus/25-15.htm">Exodus 25:15</a> that the staves of the ark shall "not be taken from it." Two explanations are possible. Either the former command does not contemplate the necessity of wrapping up the ark, and only applies to all times when it was at rest, or in movement; or else the latter direction only means, in the case of the ark, that the staves should be adjusted for the purpose of bearing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And they shall spread</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#347;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
