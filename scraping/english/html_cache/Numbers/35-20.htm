In biblical law, intent is crucial in determining guilt. The Hebrew legal system distinguished between accidental and intentional harm, reflecting God's justice.

the Lord is adding another scenario that falls under the same verdict of intentional killing, just as <a href="/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a> declares, &#8220;If a man schemes and kills another man deliberately, take him from My altar that he may die.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If anyone maliciously pushes another</b><p>- &#8220;Maliciously&#8221;
