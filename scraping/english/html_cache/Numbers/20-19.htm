This road was a major trade route in the ancient Near East, running from the Gulf of Aqaba to Damascus. By staying on this road, the Israelites aim to minimize disruption and avoid conflict, showing respect for Edom's territory.<p><b>the Israelites replied,</b><br>This response comes after Edom's initial refusal to allow passage. The Israelites, descendants of Jacob, are addressing the Edomites, descendants of Esau. The historical tension between these two nations is rooted in the sibling rivalry between Jacob and Esau, as recorded in Genesis. Despite this tension, the Israelites seek peaceful negotiation.<p><b>&#8220;and if we or our herds drink your water,</b><br>Water was a precious resource in the arid regions of Edom. The Israelites acknowledge the potential strain on Edom's resources and offer to compensate for any water consumed. This reflects a cultural understanding of hospitality and resource management in the ancient Near East, where water rights were crucial for survival.<p><b>we will pay for it.</b><br>The offer to pay for water indicates a willingness to engage in fair trade and respect for Edom's sovereignty. This gesture is significant in a historical context where nomadic tribes often clashed over resources. The Israelites' proposal aligns with biblical principles of justice and fairness, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>.<p><b>There will be no problem;</b><br>The Israelites assure Edom that their passage will not cause harm or conflict. This statement underscores their peaceful intentions and desire to avoid hostilities. It reflects a broader biblical theme of seeking peace and reconciliation, as encouraged in <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>.<p><b>only let us pass through on foot.&#8221;</b><br>The request to pass through "on foot" highlights the Israelites' vulnerability and dependence on Edom's goodwill. It also emphasizes their non-threatening nature, as they are not seeking to conquer or settle in Edom. This plea for passage is reminiscent of the Israelites' reliance on God's provision and guidance during their wilderness journey, as seen throughout the book of Numbers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Moses, seeking passage through Edom to reach the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, who refused passage to the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, negotiating with Edom for safe passage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom's_king.htm">Edom's King</a></b><br>The ruler who denied the Israelites' request, leading to a detour in their journey.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_main_road.htm">The Main Road</a></b><br>The King's Highway, a major trade route that the Israelites sought to use for their journey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/peaceful_negotiation.htm">Peaceful Negotiation</a></b><br>The Israelites' approach to Edom exemplifies a peaceful and respectful request, even when facing opposition.
