In the biblical narrative, Moses is often portrayed as a faithful servant who carries out God's commands precisely. This obedience is crucial, as it sets a standard for the Israelites and underscores the importance of following divine guidance. The phrase also highlights the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God provides direction, and the people are expected to follow. This obedience is a recurring theme throughout the Pentateuch and is essential for maintaining the blessings and protection of God. The command to number the people is part of God's plan to organize the Israelites for their journey and eventual conquest of the Promised Land.<p><b>So Moses numbered them</b><br>The act of numbering, or taking a census, was significant for several reasons. It was a practical measure to organize the tribes for military purposes, as they were preparing to enter Canaan. The census also served to establish a clear record of the people who were part of the covenant community. This act of numbering is reminiscent of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of the "book of life," where the names of the faithful are recorded (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>). The census underscores the importance of each individual within the community and their role in God's plan.<p><b>in the Wilderness of Sinai:</b><br>The Wilderness of Sinai is a significant location in the biblical narrative. It is here that the Israelites received the Law, including the Ten Commandments, and where they entered into a covenant with God. The wilderness represents a place of testing and transformation, where the Israelites learned to rely on God for sustenance and guidance. Geographically, the Sinai Peninsula is a rugged and arid region, which would have posed significant challenges for the large community of Israelites. The wilderness experience is often seen as a type of the Christian journey, where believers are tested and refined in their faith. The Sinai experience is foundational for understanding the identity and mission of Israel as God's chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who commands Moses to take a census of the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

The tabernacle has just been erected (<a href="/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>), and the nation is pausing before setting out for the Promised Land.

Divine initiative is a recurring pattern (<a href="/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1-9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-3.htm">Deuteronomy 1:3</a>).

Note the simple flow: command, then action.
