The rebellion is significant as it represents a direct challenge to God's appointed leaders. Korah's followers included 250 leaders of the congregation, indicating a substantial faction within the Israelite community. This rebellion is a pivotal moment in Israel's wilderness journey, highlighting issues of authority and divine appointment. The context is crucial, as it occurs after the Israelites' refusal to enter the Promised Land, reflecting a period of unrest and dissatisfaction among the people.<p><b>Take censers,</b><br>Censers were vessels used for burning incense, a practice integral to Israelite worship and priestly duties. The instruction to take censers is significant because it symbolizes the priestly role, which Korah and his followers sought to usurp. In the broader biblical context, censers are associated with the priesthood and the tabernacle, emphasizing the sacredness of the task. The use of censers by Korah and his followers is a direct challenge to the Aaronic priesthood, as only those appointed by God were permitted to perform such duties. This act foreshadows the judgment that will follow, as it is a test of divine approval. The censers also serve as a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest, mediating between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah.htm">Korah</a></b><br>A Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, challenging their leadership and the priesthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the appointed high priest of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rebellion.htm">The Rebellion</a></b><br>An event where Korah, along with Dathan, Abiram, and 250 community leaders, questioned the authority of Moses and Aaron.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/censers.htm">Censers</a></b><br>Implements used for burning incense, symbolizing the offering of worship and prayer to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_god-ordained_leadership.htm">Respect for God-Ordained Leadership</a></b><br>God appoints leaders for His purposes, and challenging them without cause is a challenge to God's authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Obedience to God's commands is crucial, especially in matters of worship and service.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_pride_and_rebellion.htm">The Dangers of Pride and Rebellion</a></b><br>Pride can lead to rebellion, which ultimately results in separation from God and His blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_intercession.htm">The Role of Intercession</a></b><br>The use of censers symbolizes intercession and the importance of approaching God with a pure heart.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_holiness_and_justice.htm">God's Holiness and Justice</a></b><br>God's response to rebellion underscores His holiness and the seriousness of sin.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_16_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 16:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_16_6_Reflect_on_leadership_roles.htm">How does Numbers 16:6 challenge us to examine our own spiritual leadership roles?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_censers_in_reverence_to_God.htm">What does "take censers" symbolize about approaching God with reverence and humility?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Numbers_16_6_to_NT_spiritual_authority.htm">How does Numbers 16:6 connect to New Testament teachings on spiritual authority?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_align_actions_with_God_s_will_8.htm">In what ways can we ensure our actions align with God's will today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Numbers_16_6_inspire_seeking_God.htm">How can Numbers 16:6 inspire us to seek God's approval over human approval?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_are_censers_important_in_Num_16_6.htm">What is the significance of censers in Numbers 16:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_16_6_Leadership_authority.htm">How does Numbers 16:6 reflect on leadership and authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Moses_tell_Korah_s_men_use_censers.htm">Why did Moses instruct Korah's followers to take censers in Numbers 16:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_numbers_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Numbers 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_did_korah_oppose_moses_and_aaron.htm">Why did Korah rebel against Moses and Aaron?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/musical_terms_in_the_bible.htm">Who was Abiram in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_are_the_grigori_angels.htm">Who was Korah in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/old_testament_blasphemy_penalty.htm">What was the Old Testament punishment for blasphemy?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Numbers 16:6 Mean</div><b>You</b><p>Moses opens with the direct address &#8220;You,&#8221; speaking straight to Korah as the ring-leader.
