The king of Arad represents one of the many local rulers in the region. Arad was a city located in the southern part of Canaan, and its king would have been concerned about the large number of Israelites approaching his territory. This encounter highlights the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the inhabitants of Canaan, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>who lived in the Negev</b><br>The Negev is a desert region in the southern part of modern-day Israel. It is characterized by its arid climate and sparse population. The mention of the Negev situates the narrative geographically, indicating that the Israelites were traveling through a challenging and inhospitable environment. This region was strategically important, serving as a buffer zone between the settled areas of Canaan and the wilderness to the south.<p><b>heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim</b><br>The road to Atharim is not precisely identified in modern geography, but it suggests a specific route taken by the Israelites. The mention of the road indicates that the Israelites were following a known path, which would have been significant for trade or military movements. The king of Arad's awareness of Israel's approach suggests that news of the Israelites' journey and their previous victories had spread, causing concern among the local Canaanite rulers.<p><b>he attacked Israel and captured some prisoners</b><br>This attack by the king of Arad is an example of the hostilities faced by the Israelites as they journeyed toward the Promised Land. The capture of prisoners indicates a successful initial assault by the Canaanites, which would have been a demoralizing event for the Israelites. This incident sets the stage for the subsequent divine intervention and victory that the Israelites would experience, demonstrating God's faithfulness and power in delivering His people. The capture and subsequent events can be seen as a test of faith and reliance on God, themes that are prevalent throughout the Israelites' wilderness journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_king_of_arad.htm">Canaanite King of Arad</a></b><br>A ruler in the southern region of Canaan, specifically in the Negev.

The date of this occurrence is uncertain. The district of Arad appears to have extended to the southern frontier of Canaan. (Comp. <a href="/numbers/33-40.htm" title="And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelled in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.">Numbers 33:40</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-14.htm" title="The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;">Joshua 12:14</a>; <a href="/context/judges/1-16.htm" title="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Judges 1:16-17</a>.) The attack probably took place either in the interval between the departure of the messengers to Edom and their return, or at the time at which the Israelites broke up from Kadesh, and before the direction of their march had been ascertained. The word <span class= "ital">Atharim, </span>which is rendered in the Authorised Version <span class= "ital">spies, </span>may be another form of the word which occurs in <a href="/numbers/14-6.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:">Numbers 14:6</a>, and which is there rendered <span class= "ital">them that searched; </span>or, as appears more probable, it may be the name of a place which does not occur elsewhere.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell.</span> Rather, "And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, which dwelt in the Negeb, heard tell." It is possible that Arad was the name of the king (it occurs as the name of a man, <a href="/1_chronicles/8-15.htm">1 Chronicles 8:15</a>), but it was almost certainly the name of his place. The "king of Arad, is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>, and "the Negeb of Arad" in <a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>. From the context of these passages it is evident that it was situated in the southernmost district of what was afterwards the territory of Judah. According to Eusebius, it stood twenty Roman miles to the south of Hebron, and its site has been found by modern travelers at Tel-Arad, a low hill in this direction.

If the rendering of the A.V. be correct, "the way of the spies" must have been the route by which they ascended to Hebron through the Negeb (<a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17, 22</a>), and the king of Arid must have anticipated an invasion in that direction, and sought to forestall it. <span class="cmt_word">And took some of them prisoners.</span> This would seem to show that he fell upon them unawares, and cut off some detached parties.
