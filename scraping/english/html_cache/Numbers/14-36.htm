This mission was a strategic reconnaissance to assess the land's fertility, the strength of its inhabitants, and the fortifications of its cities. The act of sending spies reflects a common ancient Near Eastern practice of gathering intelligence before military campaigns. The selection of these men underscores the importance of their task, as they were representatives of their respective tribes.<p><b>who had returned</b><br>The spies completed their 40-day mission and returned to the Israelite camp at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. Their return was eagerly anticipated by the Israelites, who were anxious to hear about the land they were to inherit. The number 40 often symbolizes a period of testing or trial in the Bible, as seen in the 40 years of wilderness wandering and Jesus' 40 days of fasting.<p><b>and made the whole congregation grumble against him</b><br>The report of the spies led to widespread discontent among the Israelites. The term "grumble" indicates a deep-seated dissatisfaction and rebellion against Moses' leadership and, by extension, against God's plan. This grumbling is a recurring theme in the wilderness narratives, highlighting the Israelites' lack of faith and trust in God's promises. It reflects a broader pattern of rebellion and disobedience that characterized their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.<p><b>by bringing out a bad report about the land&#8212;</b><br>The spies' report was negative, focusing on the formidable inhabitants and fortified cities of Canaan, rather than the land's abundance. This "bad report" contradicted the promise of God to give them a land flowing with milk and honey. The negative report sowed fear and doubt among the Israelites, leading them to question God's ability to fulfill His promises. This incident is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, as it resulted in God's judgment that the current generation would not enter the Promised Land, except for Joshua and Caleb, who had faith in God's promise. The bad report serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of unbelief and disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>Twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel, sent by Moses to scout the land of Canaan.

They had position, influence, and firsthand exposure to God&#8217;s mighty works. Their mission was simple: &#8220;Go up through the Negev and into the hill country&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a>), then bring back an accurate picture. <a href="/deuteronomy/1-22.htm">Deuteronomy 1:22-24</a> shows that the people themselves asked for this reconnaissance, and the Lord accommodated.

Coming back alive was grace in itself, echoing how God had preserved Israel through the Red Sea (<a href="/bsb/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>). Their safe return positioned them to strengthen the nation&#8217;s faith&#8212;yet they chose the opposite. With every report we offer, we either build faith or erode it (<a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and made the whole congregation grumble against him</b><p>Instead of uniting behind Moses, the spies&#8217; words ignited rebellion. <a href="/numbers/14-1.htm">Numbers 14:1-2</a> records the fallout: &#8220;the whole congregation lifted up their voices and cried.&#8221; Grumbling wasn&#8217;t new (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2</a>), but this time it threatened the entire covenant plan. First Corinthians 10:10 warns believers not to &#8220;grumble, as some of them did&#8212;and were killed by the destroying angel.&#8221; Complaining is contagious, and leadership can become the lightning rod for collective doubt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by bringing out a bad report about the land&#8212;</b><p>The root sin wasn&#8217;t poor scouting; it was unbelief. <a href="/numbers/13-32.htm">Numbers 13:32-33</a> says they exaggerated obstacles, downplaying God&#8217;s promises. <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-19</a> later cites this episode to caution against &#8220;an evil, unbelieving heart.&#8221; Their words carried weight, spreading fear like wildfire (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>). A &#8220;bad report&#8221; still does the same when believers magnify problems over God&#8217;s power (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/14-36.htm">Numbers 14:36</a> exposes how influential leaders, entrusted with divine assignment, returned safely yet chose to sow unbelief.

The verse reminds every believer that privilege demands responsibility, and the reports we bring back&#8212;whether to family, church, or culture&#8212;should spotlight God&#8217;s faithfulness, not eclipse it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/14-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
