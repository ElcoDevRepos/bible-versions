The cleansing ritual signifies their consecration and readiness to serve God. The concept of cleansing is central in the Old Testament, symbolizing spiritual purification and preparation for holy service. This mirrors the New Testament call for believers to be spiritually cleansed and set apart for God's work.<p><b>Sprinkle them with the water of purification:</b><br>The water of purification likely refers to water mixed with the ashes of a red heifer, as described in <a href="/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>. This ritual underscores the importance of purification from sin and impurity, a theme that runs throughout Scripture. The sprinkling of water can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament practice of baptism, symbolizing the washing away of sin and the beginning of a new life dedicated to God.<p><b>Have them shave their whole bodies:</b><br>Shaving the entire body was a symbolic act of removing impurity and starting anew. This practice is similar to the Nazirite vow, where shaving marked the end of a period of consecration (<a href="/numbers/6-18.htm">Numbers 6:18</a>). It signifies a complete transformation and dedication to God, paralleling the Christian concept of becoming a new creation in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p><b>and wash their clothes:</b><br>Washing clothes is a recurring biblical symbol for purification and righteousness. In ancient cultures, clean garments often represented purity and readiness to enter God's presence. This act is echoed in <a href="/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>, where the saints have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, symbolizing spiritual purity through Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>and so purify themselves:</b><br>The purification process for the Levites was both physical and spiritual, preparing them for their sacred duties. This comprehensive cleansing reflects the holistic nature of God's requirements for holiness. It points to the ultimate purification available through Jesus Christ, who cleanses believers from all unrighteousness (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>), enabling them to serve God in spirit and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>The tribe of Levi was set apart for religious duties and service in the Tabernacle.

The command is not a suggestion; it is a divine directive that grants the Levites the privilege of serving at the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/8-14.htm">Numbers 8:14</a>). God&#8217;s instructions echo earlier ordination ceremonies for priests (<a href="/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>), confirming that ministry always begins with God-given cleansing, never human invention.<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Service flows out of holiness; cleansing precedes ministry (<a href="/2_timothy/2-21.htm">2 Timothy 2:21</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s pattern is orderly, detailed, and purposeful, reminding us that He is not casual about worship (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sprinkle them with the water of purification</b><p>&#8220;Sprinkle them with the water of purification&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/8-7.htm">Numbers 8:7</a>).

The bullock which was appointed to be offered as a sin-offering at the consecration of Aaron and his sons (<a href="/exodus/29-14.htm" title="But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shall you burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.">Exodus 29:14</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-14.htm" title="And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bullock for the sin offering.">Leviticus 8:14</a>) is described by the same word which is here employed (in the Authorised Version, <span class= "ital">sin-offering</span>); and in <a href="/leviticus/4-14.htm" title="When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 4:14</a>, the sacrifice which was appointed to be offered for the expiation of sin (in the Authorised Version, <span class= "ital">the sin</span>) is also spoken of under the same name; so also is the sin-offering of the Levites in <a href="/numbers/8-8.htm" title="Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shall you take for a sin offering.">Numbers 8:8</a> of this chapter. The sin-water evidently denotes the water appointed to be used in the purification of sin; and the reference is probably (as in <a href="/numbers/6-17.htm" title="And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.">Numbers 6:17</a>) to the water which was kept in the brazen laver in front of the Tabernacle. It is possible, however, that some direction which is not here recorded may have been given respecting putting the ashes of the sin-offering into water. (Comp. <a href="/numbers/19-9.htm" title="And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.">Numbers 19:9</a>, where the water of purification is described under the same name: "it is a purification for sin." Literally, it is <span class= "ital">hattath.</span>) In this case, however, the sin-offering, which is not mentioned until <a href="/numbers/8-8.htm" title="Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shall you take for a sin offering.">Numbers 8:8</a>, must have been sacrificed previously to the sprinkling. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sprinkle water of purifying upon them.</span> Rather, "water of sin," so called because it had to do with the removal of sin, just as "water of separation" (<a href="/numbers/19-9.htm">Numbers 19:9, 13</a>) was that which delivered from the legal state of separation. It is not likely to have been prepared in the same manner as this latter (<a href="/numbers/19-9.htm">Numbers 19:9</a>), both because of the great difference between the two cases, and because the ordinance of the red heifer belonged to a later period. Nor is it likely to have resembled that used for cleansing the leper, or the water of jealousy. But it is rash to conclude that, because we do not read any special directions for its preparation, it must, therefore, have been nothing trot water from the laver which stood in the outer court. That water appears, indeed, to be called "holy water" in <a href="/numbers/5-17.htm">Numbers 5:17</a>, which is intelligible enough; but no probable reason can be shown why it should be called "sin water;" it would seem as reasonable to call the water which our Lord turned into wine "sill water," because it stood there "for the purifying of the Jews." It is better to say that we do not know, because it is not recorded, how this water was prepared, or how it corresponded to its name. The Levites who were to be sprinkled would seem to have included all the males, some twenty thousand in number; because it was <span class="accented">all</span> the males, and not only those between thirty and fifty, who were to be dedicated in place of the first-born. In any case it was, of course, impossible that Moses could have sprinkled them individually (see below on verse 11). <span class="cmt_word">Let them shave all their flesh.</span> Literally, "let them cause the razor to pass over their whole body."
