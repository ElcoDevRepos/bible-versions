They were from the tribe of Manasseh, one of the tribes of Israel. Their story is significant because it highlights the issue of inheritance rights for women in ancient Israel. In a patriarchal society, inheritance typically passed through male descendants. However, Zelophehad had no sons, prompting his daughters to appeal for their right to inherit their father's land. This event is a pivotal moment in biblical history, showcasing God's justice and provision for all His people, regardless of gender.<p><b>did as the LORD had commanded Moses.</b><br>This phrase underscores the obedience of the daughters to God's command, as relayed through Moses. It reflects the importance of following divine instructions and the role of Moses as a mediator between God and the Israelites. The command given to Moses, which allowed the daughters to inherit, was a direct response to their plea and was later codified into Israelite law, ensuring that women in similar situations could inherit property. This obedience also highlights the broader theme of faithfulness to God's word, a recurring motif throughout the Bible. The daughters' actions can be seen as a type of Christ's obedience to the Father, fulfilling God's will perfectly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughters_of_zelophehad.htm">Daughters of Zelophehad</a></b><br>These were the five daughters of Zelophehad&#8212;Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah&#8212;who approached Moses to claim their inheritance rights in the absence of a male heir.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zelophehad.htm">Zelophehad</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Manasseh who died without male heirs, prompting his daughters to seek an inheritance among their father's brothers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received and communicated God's laws and commands, including the ruling on the daughters' inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel who provided the law and guidance to Moses and the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, to which Zelophehad and his daughters belonged.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_command.htm">Obedience to God's Command</a></b><br>The daughters of Zelophehad exemplify obedience by following God's command through Moses.
