The exact location of Alush is not definitively known, but it is believed to be in the Sinai Peninsula. This stage of the journey highlights the nomadic lifestyle of the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings, emphasizing their dependence on God's guidance and provision.<p><b>and camped at Rephidim</b><br>Rephidim is a significant location in the Israelites' journey, known for the lack of water and the subsequent miracle of water from the rock. It is also the site of the battle against the Amalekites, where Moses held up his hands to ensure Israel's victory. This location underscores the challenges faced by the Israelites and God's continued intervention on their behalf.<p><b>where there was no water for the people to drink</b><br>The lack of water at Rephidim tested the faith and patience of the Israelites. This situation is a recurring theme in their wilderness journey, symbolizing spiritual thirst and the need for reliance on God. The miraculous provision of water from the rock at Rephidim is a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "living water" in the New Testament (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>).
