In the Hebrew context, this implies a deliberate and rebellious act against God's commandments. The concept of defiant sin is contrasted with unintentional sins, which were covered by specific sacrifices (Leviticus 4). Defiant sin reflects a heart posture of rebellion and pride, akin to the sin of Satan (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-14</a>).<p><b>whether a native or foreigner</b><br>This inclusion of both native Israelites and foreigners (sojourners) highlights the universality of God's law. It underscores that God's standards are the same for all people within the community, reflecting the inclusive nature of God's covenant with Israel. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where salvation and judgment are available to both Jews and Gentiles (<a href="/romans/2-9.htm">Romans 2:9-11</a>).<p><b>blasphemes the LORD</b><br>Blasphemy in this context means to speak or act against the honor and holiness of God. It is a serious offense, as it directly challenges God's authority and character. In biblical history, blasphemy was punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). This underscores the gravity of defiant sin as not just a personal failing but an affront to God's divine majesty.<p><b>That person shall be cut off from among his people</b><br>Being "cut off" can imply both social and spiritual consequences. It often meant excommunication or even death, severing the individual from the covenant community. This reflects the seriousness of maintaining holiness within the community, as seen in the New Testament with church discipline (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>). The ultimate purpose is to preserve the sanctity of God's people and to lead the sinner to repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_defiant_sinner.htm">The Defiant Sinner</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who sins with a high hand, meaning they do so intentionally and with arrogance, showing contempt for God's commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is blasphemed by the defiant sinner.
