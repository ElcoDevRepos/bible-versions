This location symbolizes God's provision and care for His people during their journey. The number twelve often represents the tribes of Israel, while seventy can symbolize completeness or the nations of the world, suggesting a foreshadowing of God's plan for all nations. Elim's mention highlights the transition from a place of abundance to the challenges of the wilderness, reflecting the spiritual journey of reliance on God.<p><b>and camped by the Red Sea</b><br>The Red Sea, or Yam Suph in Hebrew, is significant as the site of the miraculous crossing where God delivered the Israelites from the pursuing Egyptian army.

The Red Sea crossing is often seen as a type of baptism, representing the believer's passage from slavery to sin into new life in Christ. The location of this encampment underscores the ongoing journey of faith and trust in God's guidance.
