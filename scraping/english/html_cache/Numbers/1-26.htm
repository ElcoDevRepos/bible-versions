Judah was the fourth son of Jacob and Leah, and his descendants became one of the most powerful tribes in Israel. This tribe is notable for producing King David and, ultimately, Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>). The tribe's territory included Jerusalem, making it central to Israel's religious and political life.<p><b>According to the records of their clans and families</b><br>The Israelites maintained detailed genealogical records, which were crucial for establishing tribal identity and inheritance rights. These records ensured that each tribe's lineage was preserved, which was particularly important for the tribe of Judah due to the messianic prophecies associated with it (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). The emphasis on clans and families highlights the communal and familial structure of ancient Israelite society.<p><b>Counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older</b><br>The age of twenty was significant in Israelite culture as it marked the transition to adulthood and eligibility for military service. This census was not merely a population count but a preparation for warfare, as God instructed Moses to count those able to serve in the army. This practice underscores the importance of readiness and responsibility in the community.<p><b>Who could serve in the army</b><br>Military service was a critical aspect of Israelite life, as the nation often faced threats from surrounding peoples. The ability to defend the land God had promised to them was essential. This phrase also reflects the broader biblical theme of spiritual warfare, where believers are called to be prepared and vigilant (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).
