This law emphasized the sanctity of life and the separation between life and death. The purification process involved the use of the ashes of a red heifer mixed with water, symbolizing cleansing and renewal. This ritual underscores the importance of holiness and purity in approaching God.<p><b>defiles the tabernacle of the LORD.</b><br>The tabernacle was the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. Defilement of the tabernacle through uncleanness was a serious offense, as it represented a breach in the relationship between God and Israel. This highlights the need for purity in worship and the seriousness of sin, which separates humanity from God.<p><b>That person must be cut off from Israel.</b><br>Being "cut off" implies exclusion from the community and its covenant blessings. This severe consequence served as a deterrent against neglecting God's laws and emphasized the communal responsibility to maintain holiness. It reflects the broader biblical theme of separation from sin and the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>He remains unclean, because the water of purification has not been sprinkled on him,</b><br>The water of purification, made with the ashes of the red heifer, was essential for cleansing. This ritual prefigures the cleansing power of Christ's sacrifice, which purifies believers from sin. The act of sprinkling signifies the application of God's provision for cleansing, pointing to the necessity of accepting divine grace for spiritual purification.<p><b>and his uncleanness is still on him.</b><br>Uncleanness represents a state of separation from God and the community. Without purification, the individual remains in a state of impurity, unable to participate in worship or community life. This underscores the need for atonement and reconciliation, themes fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who provides ultimate cleansing from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who received the laws and commandments through Moses.

Even necessary contact&#8212;burying a loved one, for instance (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-6.htm">Deuteronomy 34:6</a>)&#8212;still carried this impurity. The point: God&#8217;s people must acknowledge that death is foreign to His life-giving presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and fails to purify himself</b><p>The uncleanness was not permanent, but it did demand intentional response. Verses 17-19 describe a specific rite involving water mixed with the ashes of the red heifer. Refusing the remedy was a deliberate act of disobedience, much like ignoring the bronze serpent (<a href="/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8-9</a>) or the Passover lamb (<a href="/exodus/12-7.htm">Exodus 12:7-13</a>).

Think of Achan bringing devoted items into Israel&#8217;s camp (<a href="/joshua/7-11.htm">Joshua 7:11-12</a>) or the Corinthians treating the Lord&#8217;s Table carelessly (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-27.htm">1 Corinthians 11:27-30</a>).

It could mean death by divine judgment (<a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>) or expulsion&#8212;either way, fellowship ended. Paul echoes the principle when he orders unrepentant sinning members removed &#8220;so that his spirit may be saved&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>). Severity underscores the worth of God&#8217;s presence and the danger of contaminating it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He remains unclean,</b><p>Uncleanness was objective, not a matter of feelings. Like leprosy (<a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>), it placed someone outside the camp until resolved. Modern parallels include harboring unforgiven sin; no amount of good deeds cancels guilt apart from God&#8217;s appointed means (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>; <a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the water of purification has not been sprinkled on him,</b><p>God Himself provided the cleansing agent (<a href="/numbers/19-2.htm">Numbers 19:2, 17</a>).

Refusal of God&#8217;s provision leaves a person in the very state Christ came to remedy (<a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his uncleanness is still on him.</b><p>Until applied, purification remains theoretical. The prodigal was still in the far country until he came home (<a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17-24</a>). Only when the lame man obeyed Jesus and rose did healing manifest (<a href="/john/5-8.htm">John 5:8-9</a>). In salvation terms, it is not enough to admire the cross; one must be washed by it (<a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a> teaches that contact with death pollutes, God provides a specific cleansing, and rejecting that provision isolates a person from His community and presence. Holiness demands separation from defilement, yet mercy supplies a way back. Under the new covenant, Christ&#8217;s blood fulfils the red-heifer picture (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>). Touching death&#8212;sin&#8217;s wages&#8212;still defiles, but whoever receives the sprinkled, life-giving work of Jesus is cleansed, welcomed, and kept in the fellowship of God&#8217;s people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Defileth the tabernacle of the Lord.</span> On the bearing of this remarkable announcement see <a href="/leviticus/15-31.htm">Leviticus 15:31</a>.
