The use of "by lot" indicates a method of allocation that was believed to reflect God's will, as seen in <a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>. This process ensured fairness and divine guidance in the distribution. The term "my lord" is a respectful address to Moses, acknowledging his leadership and role as God's chosen mediator. The concept of land inheritance is central to the covenant promises made to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>), emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs.<p><b>He also commanded him to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights a specific case that set a precedent in Israelite inheritance laws. Zelophehad, from the tribe of Manasseh, had no sons, and his daughters petitioned Moses for their father's inheritance (<a href="/numbers/27.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>). God's command to grant them the inheritance was a significant development in the rights of women within the Israelite community, ensuring that a family's name and property remained within the tribe. This decision reflects God's justice and care for all members of the community, regardless of gender. It also underscores the importance of maintaining tribal boundaries and inheritance within the covenant community, as seen in the broader narrative of Numbers and Joshua.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zelophehad's_daughters.htm">Zelophehad's Daughters</a></b><br>The daughters of Zelophehad&#8212;Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah&#8212;are central figures in this passage.

This respectful phrase reminds us of Moses&#8217; unique role as the mouthpiece of the LORD (<a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>). Their appeal rests not on personal preference but on divine authority, a pattern seen throughout the wilderness journey (<a href="/exodus/16-28.htm">Exodus 16:28</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-31.htm">Numbers 15:31</a>). By grounding their request in what &#8220;the LORD commanded,&#8221; they underline that every inheritance decision must align with God&#8217;s revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot</b><p>Casting lots placed the distribution firmly in God&#8217;s hands (<a href="/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Lots eliminated human favoritism, ensuring each tribe accepted its God-appointed portion (<a href="/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1&#8211;2</a>; 18:10).<p>&#8226; Calling the land an &#8220;inheritance&#8221; highlights permanence; the land was a gift meant to stay within each tribe forever (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>).<p>&#8226; This phrase therefore affirms that the upcoming settlement in Canaan is God&#8217;s covenant promise fulfilled (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-11.htm">Psalm 105:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He also commanded him</b><p>The leaders seamlessly connect the general land command with a specific directive already given. God&#8217;s instructions are consistent and comprehensive: if He orders the broad allotment, He also covers individual cases (<a href="/numbers/27-5.htm">Numbers 27:5&#8211;7</a>). Moses&#8217; authority extends to both, showing that no detail of Israel&#8217;s life is outside divine concern (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-24.htm">Deuteronomy 6:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters</b><p>This recalls the earlier ruling where the LORD upheld the daughters&#8217; right to their father&#8217;s land (<a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;our brother&#8221; emphasizes clan solidarity; Zelophehad&#8217;s daughters are not outsiders but members whose welfare affects the whole tribe (<a href="/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Granting them property preserved their father&#8217;s name, fulfilling the cultural and covenantal goal that no tribe lose its heritage (<a href="/numbers/36-5.htm">Numbers 36:5&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-5.htm">Ruth 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Later Joshua honors this verdict when he apportions land west of the Jordan: &#8220;So Manasseh received ten shares besides the land of Gilead and Bashan&#8230; because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/36-2.htm">Numbers 36:2</a> anchors the inheritance question in God&#8217;s unchanging commands. The leaders remind Moses that the same divine authority that assigned land by lot also guaranteed Zelophehad&#8217;s daughters their portion. By linking the general and the specific, the verse underscores God&#8217;s fairness, His concern for every family, and the reliability of His word&#8212;a lesson still reassuring to all who trust His promises today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My lord.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>.
