Although God initially permitted Balaam to go with Balak's messengers, Balaam's intentions were not aligned with God's will. This reflects the biblical principle that God examines the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). Balaam's journey symbolizes a conflict between divine will and human ambition, highlighting the importance of obedience to God over personal gain.<p><b>and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to oppose him</b><br>The "angel of the LORD" is often seen as a theophany, a manifestation of God Himself, which underscores the seriousness of the situation. This divine intervention serves as a warning and a barrier to prevent Balaam from proceeding with his misguided mission. The angel's presence signifies God's active role in guiding and correcting His people, similar to other biblical instances where God intervenes directly, such as with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11</a>) and Joshua (<a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13-15</a>).<p><b>Balaam was riding his donkey</b><br>The donkey, a common mode of transportation in ancient times, becomes a key player in this narrative. The use of a donkey, a humble and lowly animal, contrasts with Balaam's status as a renowned prophet. This scenario foreshadows the New Testament account of Jesus entering Jerusalem on a donkey (<a href="/matthew/21.htm">Matthew 21:1-11</a>), symbolizing humility and peace. The donkey's role in the story also emphasizes that God can use any means to accomplish His purposes and communicate His message.<p><b>and his two servants were with him</b><br>The presence of Balaam's servants highlights the social and cultural norms of the time, where individuals of Balaam's stature would travel with attendants. This detail also serves to authenticate the narrative, providing witnesses to the events that unfold. The servants' presence underscores the public nature of Balaam's journey and the subsequent divine encounter, ensuring that the account of God's intervention would be known and shared.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner who is summoned by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse the Israelites.

There can be no question that the ordinary translation is fight, and that God was angry with Balaam for going at all on such an errand. It is true that God had given him permission to go, but that very permission was a judicial act whereby God punished the covetous and disobedient longings of Balaam in allowing him to have his own way.
