Their complaints reflect a lack of trust in God's provision and a tendency to focus on immediate discomfort rather than the promise of the Promised Land. This behavior is a recurring theme in the wilderness narratives, highlighting human nature's inclination to grumble despite divine intervention and blessings.<p><b>in the hearing of the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's omnipresence and His awareness of human actions and attitudes. It serves as a reminder that nothing is hidden from God, and He is attentive to the cries and complaints of His people. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139</a>, which speaks of God's intimate knowledge of our thoughts and words.<p><b>and when He heard them, His anger was kindled</b><br>God's response to the Israelites' complaints is one of righteous anger. This reflects His holiness and justice, as well as the seriousness of ingratitude and rebellion against His divine plan. The anger of God is a theme found throughout the Old Testament, illustrating the consequences of disobedience and lack of faith.<p><b>and fire from the LORD blazed among them</b><br>The fire represents God's judgment and serves as a physical manifestation of His anger. In the Old Testament, fire is often associated with God's presence and power, as seen in the burning bush (Exodus 3) and the pillar of fire that guided the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). This event underscores the severity of the Israelites' sin and the immediate consequences of their actions.<p><b>and consumed the outskirts of the camp</b><br>The consumption of the camp's outskirts signifies both a warning and a merciful limitation of God's judgment. It serves as a call to repentance for the Israelites, allowing them to recognize their wrongdoing and turn back to God. The sparing of the entire camp demonstrates God's patience and willingness to forgive, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who led and provided for the Israelites during their journey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting of the Israelites' journey, representing both physical and spiritual challenges.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp.htm">The Camp</a></b><br>The temporary dwelling place of the Israelites, organized around the Tabernacle, where God's presence dwelt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fire_of_the_lord.htm">The Fire of the LORD</a></b><br>A manifestation of God's judgment and holiness, consuming the outskirts of the camp as a response to the people's complaints.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_complaining.htm">The Danger of Complaining</a></b><br>Complaining reflects a lack of trust in God's provision and plan.

The verse teaches that grumbling is a serious offense before the Lord who hears every word, that His holiness demands judgment, and that His mercy provides room for repentance through a mediator. The passage calls believers to cultivate gratitude and trust, remembering that the same holy God still listens and responds today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XI.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">And when the people complained . . . --</span>Better, <span class= "ital">And the people were as those who complained </span>(or <span class= "ital">murmured</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>(which was) <span class= "ital">evil in the ears of the Lord</span>.

Reference may be made in illustration of this point to <a href="/context/exodus/14-11.htm" title="And they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? why have you dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?">Exodus 14:11-14</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/15-24.htm" title="And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?">Exodus 15:24-25</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/16-2.htm" title="And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:">Exodus 16:2-8</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/17-3.htm" title="And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why is this that you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?">Exodus 17:3-7</a>. The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews argues from the just recompense of reward which every transgression and disobedience received under the Law, the impossibility of the escape of those who neglect the great salvation of the Gospel.

It is literally, "And the people were as complainers evil in the ears of the Lord." This may be paraphrased as in the A.V.; or it may be rendered as in the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:10</a>), where <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> means the wicked things they uttered in their discontent; or the "evil" may mean the hardships they complained cf. The Targums understand it in the same way as the Septuagint, and this seems to agree best with the context. As to the time and place of this complaining, the narrative seems to limit it within the three days' march from the wilderness of Sinai; but it is not possible to fix it more precisely. It is sufficient that the very first incident in the great journey thought worthy of record was this sin and its punishment, and the natural conclusion is that it came to pass very shortly after the departure. As to the reason of the complaining, although it is not stated, and although there does not seem to have been any special cause of distress, we can hardly be mistaken about it. The fatigue and anxiety of the march, after a year's comparative idleness, the frightful nature of the country into which they were marching, and the unknown terrors of the way which lay before them, these were quite enough to shake their nerves and upset their minds. Such things could only be borne and faced in a spirit of faith and trustful dependence upon God and their appointed leaders, and that spirit they knew nothing cf. Slavery, even when its outward pressure is past and gone like a bad dream, leaves behind it above all things an incurable suspicion of, and a rooted disbelief in, others, which shows itself outwardly by blank ingratitude and persistent complaint of bad treatment. This is the well-known mental attitude of liberated slaves even towards their benefactors and liberators; and in the case of Israel this temper extended to the King of Israel himself, whom they held responsible for all the privations and terrors of an apparently needless journey through a hideous waste. The Targum of Palestine says here, "There were wicked men of the people who, being discontent, devised and imagined evil before the Lord." The complaining, however, seems to have been general throughout the host, as the Psalmist more truly acknowledges (<a href="/psalms/78-17.htm">Psalm 78:17-22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the fire of the Lord burnt among them.</span> The "fire of the Lord" may mean one of three things. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Lightning, as apparently in <a href="/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16</a>; for lightning to the unscientific is the fiery bolt, even as thunder is the angry voice, of God (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/12-18.htm">1 Samuel 12:18, 19</a>). <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> A miraculous outburst of flame from the Presence in the tabernacle, such as slew Nadab and Abihu (<a href="/leviticus/10-2.htm">Leviticus 10:2</a>), and afterwards the 250 men who offered incense (chapter 16:35). <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A miraculous descent of fire from heaven, as apparently in <a href="/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10-12</a> (cf. <a href="/revelation/13-13.htm">Revelation 13:13</a>). Of these the second seems to be excluded by the fact that the conflagration was in the outskirts of the camp furthest removed from the tabernacle. If we suppose the fire to have been natural, we may further suppose that it set alight to the dry bushes and shrubs which abound in parts of the desert, and which blaze with great fury when the flame is driven by the wind. It is, however, at least as likely that a wholly supernatural visitation of God is here intended. What is most important to notice is this, that the punishment in this case followed hard and sore upon the sin, whereas before they came to Sinai the Lord had passed over similar murmurings without any chastisement (<a href="/exodus/15-24.htm">Exodus 15:24</a>; <a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2</a>). The reason of this difference was twofold. In the first place, they had now had abundant opportunity to become acquainted with the power and goodness of the Lord, and had solemnly entered into covenant with him, and he had taken up his abode among them; wherefore their responsibilities grew with their privileges, their dangers kept pace with their advantages. In the second place, they had while at Sinai committed an act of national apostasy (<a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>), the punishment of which, although suspended (verse 14), was only suspended (verse 34), and was always capable of being revived; Israel was plainly warned that he was under sentence, and that any disobedience would awake the terrors of the Lord against him. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">consumed... in the uttermost parts of the camp.</span> Probably setting fire to the outer line of tents, or some pitched outside the line, and consuming the people that were in them. The Targum of Palestine affirms that it "destroyed some of the wicked in the outskirts of the house of Dan, with whom was a graven image;" but this attempt to shift the responsibility, and to alter the character of the sin, is clearly worthless, and only suggested by occurrences wholly unconnected with the present (see <a href="/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/11-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Soon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
