He is from the tribe of Ephraim and is first introduced in <a href="/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9</a> as a military leader. Joshua's role as Moses' successor is foreshadowed here, as he later leads the Israelites into the Promised Land. His name, meaning "Yahweh is salvation," is the Hebrew equivalent of the Greek name Jesus, making him a type of Christ as a deliverer of God's people.<p><b>the attendant to Moses since youth</b><br>Joshua served as Moses' assistant from a young age, indicating a long-standing relationship and trust between them. This role is crucial as it prepares Joshua for leadership. His service to Moses is a model of discipleship and mentorship, reflecting the importance of learning from godly leaders. This relationship is reminiscent of Elisha's service to Elijah, highlighting the biblical principle of succession in leadership.<p><b>spoke up and said</b><br>Joshua's willingness to speak up demonstrates his zeal and protective nature towards Moses and the established order. It shows his concern for maintaining the authority and sanctity of Moses' leadership. This moment is a learning experience for Joshua, as it reveals his initial misunderstanding of God's broader plan for His people.<p><b>&#8220;Moses, my lord,</b><br>By addressing Moses as "my lord," Joshua shows respect and acknowledges Moses' authority. This title reflects the hierarchical structure within the Israelite community, where Moses is seen as God's appointed leader. It also underscores the deep respect and loyalty Joshua has for Moses, which is essential for his future role as leader.<p><b>stop them!&#8221;</b><br>Joshua's reaction to Eldad and Medad prophesying in the camp reflects a concern for maintaining order and authority. He perceives their actions as a potential threat to Moses' leadership. However, Moses' response in the following verses teaches a lesson in humility and the expansive nature of God's Spirit. This incident parallels the New Testament account in <a href="/mark/9-38.htm">Mark 9:38-40</a>, where Jesus teaches His disciples about the inclusivity of God's work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua_son_of_nun.htm">Joshua son of Nun</a></b><br>Joshua is a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his role as Moses' assistant and later as the leader who would bring the Israelites into the Promised Land.

Joshua fears unauthorized voices may fracture unity, much like later disciples forbid a man casting out demons in Jesus&#8217; name (<a href="/mark/9-38.htm">Mark 9:38-40</a>).<p>- His plea shows:<p>&#8226; Zeal for purity of leadership&#8212;reminiscent of Uzziah&#8217;s guard stopping anyone but priests from offering incense (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-18.htm">2 Chronicles 26:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Limited understanding of how freely God can distribute His Spirit&#8212;anticipating Paul&#8217;s reminder that &#8220;there are different gifts, but the same Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>).<p>- Moses answers, &#8220;Are you jealous on my behalf? I wish that all the LORD&#8217;s people were prophets&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/11-29.htm">Numbers 11:29</a>), revealing divine generosity that transcends human boundary lines, a generosity later poured out at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/11-28.htm">Numbers 11:28</a> captures Joshua&#8217;s sincere but narrow-minded zeal to safeguard Moses&#8217; authority. His lifelong loyalty prompts him to protect what he perceives as sacred order, yet Moses&#8217; reply teaches that God&#8217;s Spirit is not limited to official channels. The verse therefore encourages respect for God-appointed leaders while warning against spiritual exclusivism, pointing us to celebrate every authentic work the Lord chooses to do among His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">My lord Moses, forbid them.--</span>The motive which prompted Joshua in making this request appears to have been similar to that which led St. John to forbid the man to cast out devils who did not follow with the Apostles (<a href="/context/mark/9-38.htm" title="And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and he follows not us: and we forbade him, because he follows not us.">Mark 9:38-39</a>; <a href="/context/luke/9-49.htm" title="And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name; and we forbade him, because he follows not with us.">Luke 9:49-50</a>). But as the man did not cast out devils in his own name, but in that of Christ, so in this case Eldad and Medad prophesied in virtue of the spirit which rested upon them from above, of which the Holy Ghost, not Moses, was the giver. The motives which deterred Eldad and Medad from going to the tent of meeting are unknown. The history teaches the freeness and the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit's influences, as afterwards did that of Cornelius, when the Holy Ghost fell upon him and upon those who were with him, previously to the reception of baptism, and they spoke with tongues and magnified God (<a href="/context/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.">Acts 10:44-48</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joshua the son of Nun.</span> See on Exodus 17:9. As before, he is called Joshua by anticipation. <span class="cmt_word">One of his young men.</span> This implies that there were others who to some extent shared his duties towards Moses; but that Joshua stood in a peculiar relation to his master is evident from <a href="/exodus/24-13.htm">Exodus 24:13</a> and Exodus 32:17, as well as from this passage itself. My lord Moses, forbid them. Probably he did not know that they had been enrolled, and he was naturally jealous for the honour of Moses - a jealousy which was not at all unnecessary, as the events of the next chapter proved. The prophesying of Eldad and Medad in the camp might well seem like the setting up of an independent authority, not in harmony with that of Moses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/11-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(bin-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Nun,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#363;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5126.htm">Strong's 5126: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nun -- father of Joshua</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the attendant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;r&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Participle - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8334.htm">Strong's 8334: </a> </span><span class="str2">To attend as a, menial, worshipper, to contribute to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">since youth,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1467;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(mib&#183;b&#601;&#183;&#7717;u&#183;r&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
