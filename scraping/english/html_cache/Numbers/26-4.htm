The age of twenty is significant as it marks the age of military service and responsibility in Israelite society. This census was not merely for counting but for preparing an army, as seen in earlier passages (<a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>). It underscores the need for readiness and accountability among the people of God.<p><b>as the LORD has commanded Moses</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the divine authority behind the census. Moses acts not on his own initiative but in obedience to God's direct command. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's leadership, where God is the ultimate ruler. It also highlights Moses' role as a faithful servant and mediator between God and the people, a type of Christ who perfectly mediates the new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5-6</a>).<p><b>And these were the Israelites who came out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase serves as a reminder of the Israelites' identity and history. It connects the current generation to the miraculous deliverance from Egypt, a foundational event in Israel's history that is frequently recalled throughout Scripture (<a href="/exodus/12-51.htm">Exodus 12:51</a>). This connection underscores God's faithfulness and the continuity of His promises. It also serves as a warning, as the previous generation who left Egypt perished in the wilderness due to unbelief (<a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-19</a>), highlighting the importance of faith and obedience for the current generation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

This repeats the pattern from the first census (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2-3</a>) and echoes the earlier requirement for battlefield readiness (<a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-5.htm">Deuteronomy 24:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The census is not Moses&#8217; idea; it springs from the LORD&#8217;s command, underscoring divine authority over national organization (<a href="/numbers/3-16.htm">Numbers 3:16</a>; 31:25-27).<p>&#8226; By limiting the count to males of military age, the LORD highlights preparedness for entering Canaan, fulfilling the promise first given to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>) and reiterated after the Red Sea crossing (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience here contrasts sharply with earlier rebellions&#8212;an opportunity for the new generation to trust rather than test God (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-33</a>; <a href="/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And these were the Israelites who came out of the land of Egypt</b><p>&#8226; The phrase ties the census to a historical anchor: the Exodus generation. Though nearly forty years have passed, God still identifies His people with the miraculous deliverance He accomplished (<a href="/exodus/12-41.htm">Exodus 12:41-42</a>).<p>&#8226; Most original adults have died in the wilderness because of unbelief (<a href="/numbers/14-35.htm">Numbers 14:35-38</a>), yet their children now stand ready to inherit the land&#8212;evidence of both judgment and mercy (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-14.htm">Deuteronomy 2:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; This reminder guards against pride; the people&#8217;s very identity rests on God&#8217;s redemptive act, not their own performance (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Linking the census to the Exodus also affirms covenant continuity: the same God who saved them now organizes them, proving His promises never lapse (<a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8-11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/26-4.htm">Numbers 26:4</a> records more than an administrative headcount. It shows God personally directing His redeemed people, equipping a new generation for conquest, and grounding their identity in the historic salvation of the Exodus. By obeying this command, Israel demonstrates trust, readiness, and continuity with the covenant-keeping LORD who brought them out of Egypt and will soon bring them into the promised land.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4, 5) <span class= "bld">Take the sum of the people . . . --</span>The verses may be rendered thus: <span class= "ital">From twenty years old and upward, as the Lord commanded Moses.
