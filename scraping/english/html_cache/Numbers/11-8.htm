The act of gathering signifies God's provision and the people's dependence on Him for sustenance. This daily collection required obedience and trust, as they could not store it for the next day, except before the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/16-19.htm">Exodus 16:19-20</a>). The gathering of manna is a reminder of God's faithfulness and a test of the Israelites' faith and obedience.<p><b>ground it on a handmill or crushed it in a mortar</b><br>The preparation of manna involved grinding or crushing, indicating the effort required to make it consumable. This process reflects the daily labor and diligence needed to partake in God's provision. The use of a handmill or mortar suggests a nomadic lifestyle, as these tools were portable and common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This preparation can be seen as a precursor to the spiritual nourishment provided by Christ, the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>then boiled it in a cooking pot or shaped it into cakes</b><br>The versatility in preparing manna&#8212;boiling or baking&#8212;demonstrates its adaptability and sufficiency as a staple food. This preparation mirrors the various ways God's word can be applied to life, providing spiritual nourishment in diverse circumstances. The shaping into cakes signifies the transformation of God's provision into a form that sustains and satisfies, much like how believers are transformed by the renewing of their minds (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p><b>It tasted like pastry baked with fine oil</b><br>The description of manna's taste as pastry with fine oil highlights its pleasantness and quality. Fine oil was a luxury in ancient times, often used in anointing and offerings, symbolizing richness and blessing. This taste can be seen as a foretaste of the spiritual richness found in Christ, who fulfills and exceeds the physical provision of manna (<a href="/john/6-49.htm">John 6:49-51</a>). The pleasant taste also serves as a reminder of God's goodness and generosity in providing for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were wandering in the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt.

This shows God&#8217;s provision was spread out for everyone, yet each household had to collect its portion (<a href="/exodus/16-17.htm">Exodus 16:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Gathering required diligence; God supplied, but the people participated&#8212;an enduring lesson on cooperating with divine provision (<a href="/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Because manna was available only six days a week (<a href="/exodus/16-22.htm">Exodus 16:22&#8211;26</a>), the walking and gathering also underscored obedience and trust in God&#8217;s timing (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ground it on a handmill or crushed it in a mortar</b><p>After collecting, the text notes two processing methods.<p>&#8226; Grinding or crushing made the manna usable, teaching that God&#8217;s gifts often require stewardship (<a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; Handmills and mortars were everyday tools, highlighting that spiritual blessings are worked out in ordinary settings (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The variety of methods indicates flexibility within God&#8217;s instructions&#8212;He prescribes the provision, but gives freedom in how it is prepared (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then boiled it in a cooking pot or shaped it into cakes</b><p>Israel prepared the manna in different ways: boiling or baking.<p>&#8226; Boiling suggests a simple, nourishing meal; shaping into cakes implies creativity and planning (<a href="/exodus/12-39.htm">Exodus 12:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Both methods stress that God&#8217;s supply is sufficient for multiple needs and tastes (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The action verbs&#8212;boiled, shaped&#8212;remind believers not to be passive with God&#8217;s Word or His gifts (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It tasted like pastry baked with fine oil</b><p>The closing line focuses on flavor and quality.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Pastry baked with fine oil&#8221; speaks of richness and delight, countering any notion that God&#8217;s provision is bland (<a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Oil often symbolizes the Holy Spirit; the pleasant taste prefigures the sweetness of Christ, the true bread from heaven (<a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; Though manna was abundant, Israel later despised it (<a href="/numbers/11-6.htm">Numbers 11:6</a>). The verse therefore warns against taking God&#8217;s good gifts for granted (<a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/11-8.htm">Numbers 11:8</a> portrays a literal, day-to-day cycle: Israel gathered God&#8217;s manna, processed it with care, cooked it creatively, and enjoyed its rich taste. The verse calls today&#8217;s believer to diligent participation in God&#8217;s provision, faithful stewardship, creative application, and grateful enjoyment of His good and satisfying gifts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">As the taste of fresh oil.--</span>Or, <span class= "ital">of a fat cake of oil. </span>In <a href="/exodus/16-31.htm" title="And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.">Exodus 16:31</a> the taste of the manna is said to have been "like wafers made with honey."
