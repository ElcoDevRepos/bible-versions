His role was to communicate God's commands and ensure the people followed them. This phrase indicates Moses' authoritative position and his responsibility to address the tribes' requests.<p><b>&#8220;If the Gadites and Reubenites cross the Jordan with you,</b><br>The tribes of Gad and Reuben requested to settle on the east side of the Jordan River, which was fertile and suitable for their livestock. Crossing the Jordan symbolizes entering the Promised Land, a significant step in Israel's journey. The condition set by Moses emphasizes unity and shared responsibility among the tribes.<p><b>with every man armed for battle before the LORD,</b><br>This phrase underscores the necessity of military readiness and the importance of divine presence in their endeavors. The Israelites were to fight under God's guidance, highlighting the belief that victory comes from the LORD. It also reflects the cultural context of ancient warfare, where battles were often seen as spiritual as well as physical contests.<p><b>and the land is subdued before you,</b><br>Subduing the land refers to conquering and taking possession of it, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham. This task required faith and obedience, as the land was inhabited by various Canaanite tribes. The phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God's people inheriting the land He promised.<p><b>then you are to give them the land of Gilead as a possession.</b><br>Gilead, a region east of the Jordan, was known for its balm and fertile land. Granting it as a possession to the Gadites and Reubenites was conditional upon their participation in the conquest. This reflects the biblical principle of reward for faithfulness and cooperation. The allocation of land also foreshadows the inheritance believers receive through Christ, who fulfills the promises of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who communicates God's commands and guidance to the people.
