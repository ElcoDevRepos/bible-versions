Balaam, a non-Israelite prophet, is an unusual choice, highlighting God's control over all nations. This meeting underscores the theme of God's direct intervention in human affairs, similar to His interactions with other prophets like Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>).<p><b>and put a message in his mouth</b><br>This reflects the concept of divine inspiration, where God directly influences the words of a prophet. It parallels instances where God gives His words to prophets, such as Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). This ensures that Balaam's prophecy is not of his own making but is divinely ordained, reinforcing the authority and truth of the message.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Return to Balak</b><br>The instruction to return to Balak, the Moabite king, highlights the ongoing narrative of Balak's attempts to curse Israel. This reflects the historical tension between Israel and surrounding nations. Balak's repeated efforts to manipulate divine will contrast with God's unchanging purpose to bless Israel, as seen in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>and speak what I tell you.&#8221;</b><br>This command emphasizes obedience to God's word, a central theme in the prophetic tradition. It underscores the importance of delivering God's message accurately, as seen in the warnings to prophets like Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/2-7.htm">Ezekiel 2:7</a>). This also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's word through Jesus Christ, who perfectly spoke the words of the Father (<a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49-50</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who communicates His will and message to Balaam.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner hired by Balak to curse Israel, but who ultimately speaks the words given by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who fears the Israelites and seeks to have them cursed by Balaam.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The region ruled by Balak, located east of the Dead Sea, representing opposition to Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_encounter.htm">The Encounter</a></b><br>A divine meeting where God directly communicates with Balaam, emphasizing His control over the situation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of all situations, even when others intend harm.

Just as He &#8220;appeared to Abram&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>) and &#8220;came and stood&#8221; before young Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>), the LORD draws near to Balaam, underscoring His sovereign freedom to confront any person, even a pagan diviner.<p>&#8226; This meeting is not accidental; it affirms that God is actively directing events (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>). He will not allow His covenant people to be cursed without His consent (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, it&#8217;s a reminder that God still intervenes, guiding circumstances for His redemptive purposes (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And put a message in his mouth</b><p>&#8226; The wording highlights divine inspiration: the prophet does not originate the oracle; God does. Similar language appears with Moses (&#8220;I will be with your mouth,&#8221; <a href="/exodus/4-12.htm">Exodus 4:12</a>) and Jeremiah (&#8220;I have put My words in your mouth,&#8221; <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; This guarantees accuracy&#8212;what Balaam will utter carries God&#8217;s authority (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; It also reveals that God can use unlikely instruments to declare His truth (<a href="/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>). The vessel&#8217;s character does not diminish the reliability of the message.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saying, &#8220;Return to Balak</b><p>&#8226; Balaam is sent back to the Moabite king who hired him to curse Israel (<a href="/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4&#8211;6</a>). God controls the itinerary, underscoring that political power submits to divine command (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The command to &#8220;return&#8221; mirrors other instances where God dispatches His messengers to challenging audiences&#8212;e.g., Moses to Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/9-1.htm">Exodus 9:1</a>) or Elijah to Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience to divine direction often requires facing human authority with an uncomfortable message, yet God equips the messenger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And speak what I tell you&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The emphasis is on total fidelity to God&#8217;s word. Balaam is forbidden to add or subtract&#8212;echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/22-18.htm">Revelation 22:18&#8211;19</a>.<p>&#8226; This clause underlines God&#8217;s protective heart for Israel: every syllable will bless, not curse (<a href="/numbers/23-20.htm">Numbers 23:20</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, it models prophetic integrity: proclaim exactly what God has revealed (<a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>), resisting pressure to tailor the message for human approval (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/23-16.htm">Numbers 23:16</a> portrays the LORD taking complete control of Balaam&#8217;s encounter with Balak. God personally meets Balaam, supplies the very words he must speak, and commands their faithful delivery. The verse reassures us that divine purposes cannot be thwarted: God guards His people and sovereignly guides even unwilling prophets to bless rather than harm.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/23-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">met</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;q&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
