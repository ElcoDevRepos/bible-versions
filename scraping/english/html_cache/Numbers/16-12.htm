These men are identified as the sons of Eliab, who belonged to the tribe of Reuben. The tribe of Reuben, being the firstborn of Jacob, might have felt entitled to leadership, which could contribute to their rebellious attitude. This context is crucial as it highlights the ongoing tension and challenges to Moses' leadership. The summoning indicates a formal call to address grievances, reflecting the judicial and leadership practices of ancient Israel.<p><b>but they said, &#8220;We will not come!&#8221;</b><br>Dathan and Abiram's refusal to come is a direct act of rebellion against Moses' authority. This defiance is significant as it not only challenges Moses but also the divine order established by God. Their response reflects a deeper issue of discontent and rebellion among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. This act of insubordination is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God's chosen leaders faced opposition, such as the rebellion against King David by Absalom. The refusal to heed Moses' summons can be seen as a type of rejection of Christ, who is the ultimate leader and mediator between God and humanity.
