The cultural and historical backdrop of this passage is significant, as women in ancient Israelite society were generally under the authority of their fathers or husbands. However, widows and divorced women were exceptions, as they were not under the direct authority of a male figure. This phrase highlights their autonomy in making vows, reflecting a degree of independence in their spiritual commitments. The emphasis on personal responsibility underscores the seriousness with which vows were regarded in the biblical context.<p><b>is binding on her.</b><br>This phrase indicates that the vows made by widows or divorced women are considered valid and must be fulfilled. The binding nature of these vows underscores the principle of accountability before God. In the broader biblical narrative, the importance of keeping one's word is a recurring theme, as seen in passages like <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>, which warns against making vows lightly. The binding nature of vows also reflects God's unchanging nature and His expectation for His people to mirror His faithfulness. This principle can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled His promises and commitments, exemplifying ultimate faithfulness and integrity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/widow.htm">Widow</a></b><br>A woman whose husband has died.
