The covering of holy objects signifies the importance of maintaining their sanctity and protecting them from defilement. This task underscores the role of the priesthood in mediating between God and the people, ensuring that the holiness of the sacred items is preserved. The coverings were likely made of specific materials as described in earlier chapters, emphasizing the care and reverence required in handling these items.<p><b>as soon as the camp is ready to move</b><br>This indicates the organized and orderly nature of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness. The movement of the camp was directed by the cloud of the Lord, which signified God's presence and guidance. The readiness to move reflects the obedience and responsiveness of the Israelites to God's leading, a theme that is recurrent throughout their wilderness journey.<p><b>the Kohathites shall come and do the carrying</b><br>The Kohathites, one of the Levitical families, were specifically tasked with carrying the most sacred items of the Tabernacle. This duty was a significant responsibility, highlighting the Kohathites' role in maintaining the sanctity of the worship space. Their service was a form of worship and obedience to God's commands, reflecting the broader theme of service and dedication in the life of the believer.<p><b>But they must not touch the holy objects, or they will die</b><br>This severe warning underscores the holiness of God and the sacredness of the objects associated with His presence. The prohibition against touching the holy objects serves as a reminder of the separation between the divine and the human, emphasizing the need for reverence and respect in approaching God. This principle is echoed in other parts of Scripture, where the holiness of God demands careful observance of His commands.<p><b>These are the transportation duties of the Kohathites regarding the Tent of Meeting</b><br>This final phrase summarizes the specific responsibilities assigned to the Kohathites, highlighting the division of labor among the Levites. The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people.

The LXX. and the Samaritan text supply a statement respecting the covering and conveyance of the brazen laver. The clause in the LXX. is as follows :--"And they shall take a purple cloth, and cover the laver and its foot (or base), and they shall put it into a blue cover of skin, and put it on bars." There is no sufficient ground. however, for supposing that the present Hebrew text is deficient in this place; and it seems more probable to suppose that the laver was not to be covered during its transport.<p><span class= "bld">After that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to bear, or carry</span>--viz., the whole of the vessels of ministry which had been previously enumerated.

We find in <a href="/context/2_samuel/6-6.htm" title="And when they came to Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.">2Samuel 6:6-7</a> an instance of the fatal result of the violation of this command by Uzzah, who being, as is most probable, a Levite, and of the family of Kohath, ought to have been acquainted with the law respecting the removal of the Ark. It is obvious that the Kohathites, as the immediate assistants of the priests, in regard to the vessels of the Sanctuary, were specially exposed to the risk of violating the law by touching the most holy things.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath.</span> One thing which the Kohathites almost certainly had to carry is omitted here, possibly because it was carried without any cover at all, and was not regarded as of equal sanctity with the rest. Anyhow, the omission is very remarkable, and may have been accidental. It is supplied by the Septuagint and the Samaritan text in the following addition to verse 14: "And they shall take a purple cloth, and cover the laver and its foot, and they shall put it into a hyacinthine cover of skin, and put it on bars."
