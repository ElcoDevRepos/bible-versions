The concept of God "delighting" in His people is seen throughout the Old Testament, where God's pleasure is linked to the faithfulness and righteousness of His followers (<a href="/psalms/147-11.htm">Psalm 147:11</a>). The idea of divine delight suggests a personal relationship between God and His people, highlighting His willingness to bless those who trust and obey Him.<p><b>He will bring us into this land</b><br>This refers to the Promised Land, Canaan, which God had sworn to give to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>, <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The journey to this land is a central theme in the Pentateuch, symbolizing God's faithfulness to His promises. The phrase underscores God's active role in fulfilling His covenant, as He is the one who will lead and enable the Israelites to enter the land.<p><b>a land flowing with milk and honey</b><br>This description of Canaan emphasizes its fertility and abundance. "Milk and honey" symbolize prosperity and the richness of the land, indicating that it is a place of sustenance and blessing. This phrase is used multiple times in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/6-3.htm">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>) to convey the idea of a bountiful inheritance. The imagery reflects the agricultural richness of the region, which was well-suited for pastoral and agrarian life.<p><b>and He will give it to us</b><br>This statement reaffirms God's promise to grant the land to the Israelites as an inheritance. It highlights the divine initiative and grace in the fulfillment of His promises. The giving of the land is not based on the Israelites' merit but on God's covenantal faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-5.htm">Deuteronomy 9:5</a>). This act of giving foreshadows the ultimate gift of salvation through Jesus Christ, who provides an eternal inheritance to believers (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promised to bring the Israelites into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/caleb_and_joshua.htm">Caleb and Joshua</a></b><br>Two of the twelve spies sent to scout the Promised Land.

He had already &#8220;carried&#8221; them &#8220;as a man carries his son&#8221; all the way from Egypt (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>).<p>- &#8220;The LORD your God Himself will fight for you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-22.htm">Deuteronomy 3:22</a>) echoes the assurance that the entry and conquest are God-led events.<p>- The verb &#8220;bring&#8221; underscores divine initiative; Israel&#8217;s role is to follow, much like the pillar of cloud and fire directed every move (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A land flowing with milk and honey</b><p>- This phrase pictures abundance and settled prosperity (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-10</a>).<p>- Milk implies thriving livestock; honey points to fertile fields and wild produce&#8212;symbols of God&#8217;s lavish provision.<p>- The description contrasts sharply with the wilderness hardships (<a href="/numbers/20-4.htm">Numbers 20:4-5</a>), reinforcing why trusting God leads to life, while disbelief traps people in barrenness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will give it to us</b><p>- Possession is framed as a gift, not as spoils earned by Israel. Joshua later testified, &#8220;The LORD gave Israel all the land He had sworn to give their fathers&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43</a>).<p>- Gift language highlights grace; God fulfills His oath to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>).<p>- Acceptance of the gift requires obedience: &#8220;Only do not rebel against the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>). Refusal to receive becomes rebellion, as seen in the generation sentenced to wander (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/14-8.htm">Numbers 14:8</a> assures that God&#8217;s delight leads to decisive action: He brings, He blesses, He gives. When His people trust and obey, they step into a life marked by His generous provision&#8212;a land flowing with milk and honey. The verse calls every reader to cling to God&#8217;s proven faithfulness, confident that His promises remain as certain today as when Caleb and Joshua spoke them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If the Lord</span> <span class="cmt_word">delight in us.</span> An expression used by Moses himself (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-15.htm">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>).
