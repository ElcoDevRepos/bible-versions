Names in the Bible frequently carry meanings that reflect the character or destiny of the person.<p><b>From the tribe of Reuben,</b><br>Reuben was the firstborn son of Jacob and Leah. The tribe of Reuben held a significant position as the firstborn, though Reuben himself lost his birthright due to his transgression (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3-4</a>). The tribe settled east of the Jordan River, an area known for its pastoral land, which aligns with their request to Moses for this territory (<a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32:1-5</a>).<p><b>Shammua son of Zaccur;</b><br>Shammua, whose name means "heard" or "hearing," was chosen to represent the tribe of Reuben. The mention of his father, Zaccur, follows the biblical tradition of identifying individuals through their lineage, emphasizing the importance of family heritage. Shammua's role as a spy was crucial, as he was tasked with assessing the Promised Land, a mission that would have significant implications for the future of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shammua.htm">Shammua</a></b><br>He was the son of Zaccur and a representative from the tribe of Reuben.

Scripture repeatedly shows the Lord calling people by name (<a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>; <a href="/luke/10-20.htm">Luke 10:20</a>). He is precise and personal; the list of spies is not random but divinely appointed.<p>&#8226; Naming each representative underscores accountability. Just as <a href="/numbers/1-17.htm">Numbers 1:17&#8211;19</a> lists leaders for the census, so <a href="/bsb/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a> lists leaders for a mission of faith. God&#8217;s Word is historically exact, reminding us that real men faced real choices that would shape Israel&#8217;s future (<a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the tribe of Reuben,</b><p>&#8226; Reuben was Jacob&#8217;s firstborn (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>), yet his tribe often lived with the tension of squandered privilege (<a href="/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>). Selecting a Reubenite highlights God&#8217;s continuing grace toward a tribe with a mixed legacy.<p>&#8226; Reuben&#8217;s camp was on Israel&#8217;s south side (<a href="/numbers/2-10.htm">Numbers 2:10</a>), near the direction the spies would initially travel. The tribe&#8217;s involvement shows that every segment of the nation shared responsibility for trusting the LORD&#8217;s promise (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-21.htm">Deuteronomy 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross references: <a href="/numbers/1-20.htm">Numbers 1:20&#8211;21</a> (Reuben&#8217;s census count), <a href="/joshua/22-1.htm">Joshua 22:1&#8211;4</a> (Reuben&#8217;s later part in settling east of the Jordan).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shammua son of Zaccur;</b><p>&#8226; Shammua represents Reuben among the twelve spies (<a href="/numbers/13-3.htm">Numbers 13:3</a>). His very inclusion signifies leadership recognition within his tribe.<p>&#8226; Although Scripture does not recount personal details of Shammua&#8217;s later life, the broader narrative reveals that only Caleb and Joshua brought back a faithful report (<a href="/numbers/14-6.htm">Numbers 14:6&#8211;9</a>). By implication, Shammua aligned with the fearful majority. This cautions believers about the danger of unbelief even among recognized leaders (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of his father, Zaccur, roots Shammua in a family line. God sees lineage and legacy, and choices made on this mission would shape both (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/13-4.htm">Numbers 13:4</a> is more than a footnote; it shows that God deliberately appoints identifiable people for specific tasks. The verse highlights divine precision, shared tribal responsibility, and the sobering truth that leadership titles do not guarantee faithful hearts. Remembered by name, Shammua challenges us to respond in faith when God calls us to trust His promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These were their names.</span> None of these names occur elsewhere, except those of Caleb and Joshua. The order of the tribes is the same as in ch. 1, except that Zebulun is separated from the other sons of Leah, and placed after Benjamin, while the two sons of Joseph are separated from one another. In verse 11 "the tribe of Joseph" is explained to be "the tribe of Manasseh;" elsewhere it is either common to both, or confined to Ephraim (see <a href="/revelation/7-8.htm">Revelation 7:8</a>, and cf. <a href="/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16</a>). No spy was sent for the tribe of Levi, because it was now understood to have no territorial claims upon the land of promise, and to stand altogether by itself in relation to the national hopes and duties. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/13-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and these</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
