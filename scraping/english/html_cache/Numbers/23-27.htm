His desperation is evident as he seeks to manipulate the situation to his advantage. Balak's repeated attempts to curse Israel highlight his fear and recognition of Israel's power, which is rooted in God's blessing. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the futility of opposing God's will. Balak's actions are driven by political and military concerns, as the Israelites' presence threatens his kingdom.<p><b>&#8220;I will take you to another place.&#8221;</b><br>Balak's strategy involves changing locations, hoping that a different setting might influence the outcome. This reflects ancient beliefs in the power of specific places and altars to affect divine will. The idea that a change in location could alter God's decision underscores a misunderstanding of God's nature, who is not bound by geography. This also illustrates the pagan practices of the time, where location and ritual were thought to sway the gods.<p><b>Perhaps it will please God</b><br>Balak's use of "perhaps" indicates uncertainty and a lack of understanding of the God of Israel. Unlike the capricious deities of the surrounding nations, the God of Israel is consistent and unchanging. This phrase highlights the contrast between pagan beliefs and the monotheistic faith of Israel. Balak's hope that God might change His mind shows a misunderstanding of God's covenant faithfulness to Israel.<p><b>that you curse them for me from there.&#8221;</b><br>The desire for a curse reflects the ancient belief in the power of spoken words to affect reality. In the biblical context, blessings and curses are significant, as seen in the covenantal blessings and curses outlined in Deuteronomy. Balak's request is ultimately futile, as God's promises to Israel cannot be overturned by human schemes. This also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of Jesus Christ, who transforms the curse of sin into a blessing for believers through His redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who is fearful of the Israelites and seeks to have them cursed by Balaam.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner who is hired by Balak to curse the Israelites but is ultimately used by God to bless them instead.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The region ruled by Balak, located east of the Dead Sea, representing opposition to Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, journeying to the Promised Land, whom Balak fears due to their numbers and God's favor upon them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The overarching theme where God demonstrates His control over the situation, ensuring His people are blessed rather than cursed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_human_plans.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Human Plans</a></b><br>Despite human intentions, God's will prevails.

Even after witnessing two failed attempts to have Israel cursed (<a href="/numbers/23-11.htm">Numbers 23:11-13, 23</a>:25-26), he tries again.<p>- The line reminds us how temptation often comes cloaked in courteous words (<a href="/genesis/4-7.htm">Genesis 4:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-8.htm">Matthew 4:8-9</a>), luring the unwary toward compromise.<p>- Scripture&#8217;s literal record here underlines the pattern: evil keeps knocking, hoping persistence will eventually wear down righteousness (<a href="/luke/4-13.htm">Luke 4:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;said Balak&#8221;</b><p>- The speaker matters. Balak, king of Moab, represents fear-driven hostility toward God&#8217;s people (<a href="/numbers/22-3.htm">Numbers 22:3-6</a>).<p>- Identifying the voice helps believers discern whether counsel aligns with God&#8217;s purposes (<a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>; <a href="/john/10-4.htm">John 10:4-5</a>).<p>- Like Pharaoh or Herod, Balak stands as a historical example of rulers who oppose the Lord yet cannot overturn His word (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I will take you to another place&#8221;</b><p>- Location shift is Balak&#8217;s strategy: maybe a new vantage will yield a different outcome. He has already moved Balaam from Bamoth-baal (23:1-3) to the field of Zophim (23:14-17) and now aims for Peor (23:28).<p>- The move illustrates how unbelief searches for loopholes rather than submitting to truth (<a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s blessing on Israel, however, is not tied to geography; His covenant stands firm wherever His people are (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Perhaps it will please God&#8221;</b><p>- Balak grudgingly acknowledges God&#8217;s sovereignty, yet treats Him as a power to be manipulated.<p>- Scripture exposes this folly: &#8220;God is not a man, that He should lie&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). No amount of maneuvering can bend Him to unrighteous ends (<a href="/1_samuel/15-29.htm">1 Samuel 15:29</a>; <a href="/acts/8-18.htm">Acts 8:18-20</a>).<p>- The verse highlights a timeless warning: lip service to God, without submission to His will, is futile (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;that you curse them for me from there&#8221;</b><p>- Balak&#8217;s goal remains unchanged&#8212;secure a curse against Israel so Moab might escape defeat (<a href="/numbers/22-6.htm">Numbers 22:6</a>).<p>- Yet God had already declared to Abraham, &#8220;I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). Every attempt to reverse that promise is doomed (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-13.htm">Revelation 12:13-17</a>).<p>- The statement underscores the spiritual battle in which the enemy seeks to speak death over God&#8217;s people, while the Lord speaks life and blessing (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/23-27.htm">Numbers 23:27</a> pictures Balak&#8217;s relentless, but ultimately powerless, scheming. Each phrase exposes his strategy: polite invitation, fear-laden leadership, shifting circumstances, superficial piety, and a fixed intention to harm Israel. The verse teaches that no human plot, new angle, or manipulative prayer can overturn God&#8217;s declared blessing on His covenant people.
