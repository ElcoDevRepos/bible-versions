The term "Nephilim" is often translated as "giants," and their presence in Canaan would have been intimidating to the Israelite spies. This reference suggests a continuation of the ancient, formidable lineage that existed before the flood, emphasizing the perceived threat in the Promised Land.<p><b>the descendants of Anak that come from the Nephilim!</b><br>The Anakim were a race of giants mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/9-2.htm">Deuteronomy 9:2</a> and <a href="/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21-22</a>. They were known for their great size and strength, and their presence in Canaan was a significant concern for the Israelites. The connection to the Nephilim implies a formidable ancestry, enhancing the fear factor for the spies. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Anakim inhabited the hill country of Hebron, a strategic and fertile area in Canaan.<p><b>We seemed like grasshoppers in our own sight,</b><br>This phrase reflects the spies' perception of their own insignificance and vulnerability compared to the inhabitants of Canaan. It highlights a lack of faith and confidence in God's promise and power. The metaphor of grasshoppers suggests extreme smallness and fragility, indicating the overwhelming fear and doubt that had taken hold of the spies.<p><b>and we must have seemed the same to them!&#8221;</b><br>This statement reveals the spies' projection of their own fears onto the Canaanites, assuming that the inhabitants saw them as weak and inconsequential. It underscores the psychological impact of fear and the failure to trust in God's deliverance. This lack of faith contrasts with the confidence shown by Caleb and Joshua, who believed in God's promise to give them the land (<a href="/numbers/14-6.htm">Numbers 14:6-9</a>). The spies' report ultimately led to Israel's rebellion and a 40-year delay in entering the Promised Land, as recounted in <a href="/numbers/14-26.htm">Numbers 14:26-35</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nephilim.htm">The Nephilim</a></b><br>A group of people mentioned in the Bible, often associated with giants.

The Nephilim are, without doubt, the primaeval tyrants mentioned under that name in <a href="/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>. The renown of these sons of violence had come down from those dim ages, and the exaggerated fears of the spies saw them revived in the gigantic forms of the Beni-Anak. There is no certainty that the Nephilim had been giants, and no likelihood whatever that the Beni-Anak had any real connection with them. As grasshoppers. We have no means of judging of the actual size of these men, unless the height assigned to Goliath (six cubits and a span) be allowed to them. Probably men of this stature were quite exceptional even among the Anakim. The report of the spies was thoroughly false in effect, although founded on isolated facts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/13-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">We even saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Nephilim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#238;&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
