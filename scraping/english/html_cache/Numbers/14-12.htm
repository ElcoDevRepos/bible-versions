The threat of a plague is significant, as plagues were often seen as divine judgments in the ancient Near East. This echoes the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-12), where God demonstrated His power over the Egyptian gods and Pharaoh. The use of a plague here underscores the seriousness of Israel's sin and God's holiness. It also serves as a reminder of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to consequences (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-58.htm">Deuteronomy 28:58-61</a>).<p><b>and I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are.&#8221;</b><br>This promise to Moses mirrors God's earlier promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob about making their descendants a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2, 26</a>:4, 35:11). It highlights God's sovereignty and ability to fulfill His promises despite human failure. The offer to Moses also parallels God's covenant with David, where God promises to establish a lasting dynasty (<a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>). This foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to establish a kingdom greater and mightier than any earthly nation (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).

We cannot, however, regard this offer as embodying a deliberate intention, for we know that God did not really mean to cast off Israel; nor can we regard it as expressing the anger of the moment, for it is not of God to be hasty. We must understand it distinctly as intended to try the loyalty and charity of Moses, and to give him an opportunity of rising to the loftiest height of magnanimity, unselfishness, and courage. Moses would unquestionably have been less noble than he was if he had listened to the offer; it is therefore certain that the offer was only made in order that it might be refused (cf. <a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/14-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will strike</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1445;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ak&#183;ken&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - first person common singular &#124;
