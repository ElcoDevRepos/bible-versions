The concept of a "pleasing aroma" is frequently used in the Old Testament to describe sacrifices that are offered in obedience and with the right heart attitude (<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>, <a href="/exodus/29-18.htm">Exodus 29:18</a>). It signifies God's acceptance and favor. The aroma is not literal but symbolic of the spiritual satisfaction God receives from the obedience and devotion of His people.<p><b>you are to present a food offering</b><br>A food offering, or grain offering, often accompanied burnt offerings and was a way to express gratitude and dependence on God for provision. It was a non-bloody offering, typically consisting of fine flour, oil, and frankincense (<a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a>). This offering symbolizes the dedication of one's labor and sustenance to God, acknowledging Him as the source of all blessings.<p><b>a burnt offering of thirteen young bulls</b><br>The burnt offering was a complete sacrifice, with the entire animal being consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication and surrender to God. The number thirteen is significant here as it corresponds to the offerings made during the Feast of Tabernacles, which required a specific number of sacrifices each day (<a href="/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12-34</a>). Bulls were considered valuable and represented strength and service, indicating the importance of the offering.<p><b>two rams</b><br>Rams were often used in sacrificial offerings and symbolized leadership and authority. The use of two rams in this context may represent a double portion of dedication or a reinforcement of the covenant relationship between God and His people. Rams were also used in the consecration of priests (<a href="/exodus/29.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>), linking this offering to themes of holiness and service.<p><b>and fourteen male lambs a year old</b><br>Lambs were common sacrificial animals, symbolizing innocence and purity. The specification of "a year old" indicates that these lambs were in their prime, representing the best of what the people could offer. The number fourteen, being double the number of completion (seven), suggests a fullness or abundance in the offering, aligning with the celebratory nature of the Feast of Tabernacles.<p><b>all unblemished</b><br>The requirement for the animals to be unblemished underscores the need for purity and perfection in offerings to God. This reflects God's holiness and the standard He sets for worship. The unblemished nature of the sacrifices points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described as the "Lamb without blemish or defect" (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>), fulfilling the sacrificial system and providing atonement for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are receiving instructions on how to worship and offer sacrifices during the Feast of Tabernacles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who commands these offerings as a part of the covenant relationship with His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast_of_tabernacles.htm">The Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot)</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival that commemorates the Israelites' journey through the wilderness and God's provision during that time.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in which the entire offering is consumed by fire, symbolizing complete dedication to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/unblemished_animals.htm">Unblemished Animals</a></b><br>The requirement for offerings to be without defect, symbolizing purity and the best of what the Israelites could offer to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites were required to follow God's instructions precisely, highlighting the importance of obedience in our relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_sacrifice.htm">Symbolism of Sacrifice</a></b><br>The unblemished animals represent the purity and perfection required in offerings, pointing to Christ as the perfect sacrifice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_faithfulness.htm">God's Provision and Faithfulness</a></b><br>The Feast of Tabernacles reminds us of God's provision and faithfulness, encouraging us to trust Him in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wholehearted_worship.htm">Wholehearted Worship</a></b><br>Just as the burnt offering was completely consumed, our worship should be wholehearted and all-encompassing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_worship.htm">Community and Worship</a></b><br>The communal aspect of the festival underscores the importance of gathering together in worship and celebration of God's goodness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_29_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 29:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_29_13_s_view_on_offerings.htm">How does Numbers 29:13 emphasize the importance of sacrificial offerings to God?

When Israel brought offerings prescribed by God, their obedience rose like sweet incense (<a href="/exodus/29-18.htm">Exodus 29:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>), assuring them of His favor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you are to present</b><p>God&#8217;s people were not passive observers; they actively brought what He required (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).

As it was the feast of the ingathering, when God had crowned the year with his goodness, and filled the hearts of men with food and gladness, so it was celebrated with the greatest profusion of burnt offerings, especially of the largest and costliest kind. <span class="cmt_word">Thirteen young bullocks.</span> The number of bullocks was so arranged as to be one less each day, to be seven on the seventh and last day, and to make up seventy altogether. Thus the sacred number was studiously emphasized, and the slow fading of festal joy into the ordinary gladness of a grateful life was set forth. It seems quite fanciful to trace any connection with the waning of the moon. The observance of the heavenly bodies, although sanctioned in the case of the new moon feast, was not further encouraged for obvious reasons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/29-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As a pleasing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1465;&#1433;&#1495;&#1463;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#238;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun -
