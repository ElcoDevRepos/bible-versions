Kohath was the second son of Levi, and his descendants were given the responsibility of caring for the most sacred objects of the tabernacle, including the Ark of the Covenant, the table of showbread, the lampstand, and the altars. This role highlights the importance of the Kohathites in maintaining the spiritual center of Israelite worship. Their duties required a high level of sanctity and reverence, as mishandling these holy items could result in severe consequences, as seen in the story of Uzzah (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>).<p><b>were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle</b><br>The placement of the Kohathites on the south side of the tabernacle was part of the organized structure of the Israelite camp, which was designed to reflect order and holiness. Each tribe and clan had a specific location around the tabernacle, which was at the center, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The south side was a position of significance, as it was one of the cardinal directions surrounding the tabernacle, indicating the Kohathites' proximity to the sacred space they served. This arrangement ensured that the Kohathites were always ready to perform their duties and highlighted the centrality of worship in the life of the Israelite community. The structured camp also foreshadows the order and peace found in God's kingdom, with the tabernacle as a type of Christ, who is the true center of worship and the presence of God among His people (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kohathites.htm">Kohathites</a></b><br>A division of the Levites, descendants of Kohath, the second son of Levi.

In <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a> the Lord promised to make Abraham &#8220;a great nation,&#8221; and here we watch that promise fleshed out in orderly family groups. The emphasis on clans reminds us that faith is never a lone-ranger endeavor; we belong to a redeemed community that works together for God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the Kohathites</b><p>Among the Levites, the Kohathites hold a special assignment: caring for the most sacred furnishings of the tabernacle&#8212;ark, table, menorah, altars (<a href="/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4-15</a>). <a href="/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18</a> lists Kohath as Levi&#8217;s second son, and <a href="/1_chronicles/6-1.htm">1 Chronicles 6:1-2</a> traces the lineage straight to Moses and Aaron, underscoring their priestly pedigree. By singling out the Kohathites, <a href="/numbers/3-29.htm">Numbers 3:29</a> highlights a people entrusted with holiness, illustrating <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>&#8212;God chooses specific people for specific tasks so that His holiness is displayed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were to camp</b><p>To &#8220;camp&#8221; is more than pitching tents; it is obeying precise marching orders (<a href="/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a>).
