In the ancient Near East, cattle were a primary measure of wealth and economic stability. This large number indicates the scale of the victory and the abundance of resources that God provided to the Israelites. Cattle were essential for agricultural work, food, and religious sacrifices, underscoring their importance in Israelite society.<p><b>including a tribute to the LORD of 72</b><br>The tribute of 72 cattle to the LORD represents the portion set aside for God from the spoils of war. This act of giving a portion to the LORD is consistent with the principle of firstfruits and tithing found throughout the Old Testament, where the best and first of what one has is dedicated to God. The number 72, being a small fraction of the total, reflects the specific command given by God to Moses regarding the division of the spoils. This tribute signifies acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and provision, as well as a reminder of the Israelites' dependence on Him. It also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is the perfect offering to God, fulfilling the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is overseeing the distribution of the spoils of war.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who have just defeated the Midianites and are dividing the spoils.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>The people defeated by the Israelites, whose possessions are being divided.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, to whom a tribute is given from the spoils.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cattle.htm">Cattle</a></b><br>Part of the spoils taken from the Midianites, a portion of which is given as a tribute to the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' act of giving a tribute to the LORD demonstrates obedience to God's instructions.
