This law emphasized the sanctity of life and the separation from death, which is a result of sin.

It was a sacred duty for all Israelites to observe it. The inability to participate due to uncleanness highlights the tension between the law's demands and human circumstances. This situation anticipates the New Testament teaching that Christ is our Passover lamb (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>), offering a way for all to be included in God's redemptive plan, regardless of their state.<p><b>And they came before Moses and Aaron that same day</b><br>Moses and Aaron, as leaders and mediators, represent the law and priesthood.

Coincidences," pp. 66, 67,1850). If the consecration of Aaron and his sons began on the first day of the first month (<a href="/exodus/40-2.htm" title="On the first day of the first month shall you set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.">Exodus 40:2</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-12.htm" title="And you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.">Exodus 40:12</a>), and the death of Nadab and Abihu could not have taken place until the eighth day (<a href="/leviticus/9-1.htm" title="And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;">Leviticus 9:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/9-12.htm" title="And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled round about on the altar.">Leviticus 9:12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/10-19.htm" title="And Aaron said to Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?">Leviticus 10:19</a>), inasmuch as the defilement caused by contact with the dead lasted for seven days (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm" title="He that touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.">Numbers 19:11</a>), it will follow, if this law was already in force, that those who buried Nadab and Abihu must have been unclean on the fourteenth day of the first month. Independently, then, of the doubtful inference which Professor Blunt draws from the identity of the numbers of the other tribes at the two numberings taken, the one before and the other after this time, from which he concludes that the deaths must have occurred amongst those who belonged to the tribe of Levi, which was not included in the census, this circumstance may fairly be adduced as one of the numerous undesigned coincidences with which Holy Scripture abounds. It may be observed further that, whilst reference would naturally be made to Moses on all doubtful occasions, none would be so likely to have recourse to him with the inquiry contained in <a href="/numbers/9-7.htm" title="And those men said to him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: why are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?">Numbers 9:7</a> as those who had been employed by his direction (<a href="/leviticus/10-4.htm" title="And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.">Leviticus 10:4</a>) in the burial of Nadab and Abihu. The law contained in <a href="/leviticus/7-21.htm" title="Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain to the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.">Leviticus 7:21</a> appears to have been understood to refer to all sacrificial meals. The legal uncleanness which disqualified the Israelites for participation in the Passover may be regarded as typical of the moral and spiritual disqualifications which render men unfit for participation in the Lord's Supper. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There were certain men.</span> It has been supposed by many that these men must have been Mishael and Elizaphan, who had recently (cf. <a href="/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>; <a href="/leviticus/9-1.htm">Leviticus 9:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/10-4.htm">Leviticus 10:4</a>) been defiled by burying their cousins Nadab and Abihu. This, however, is based upon the assumption that the totals given in <a href="/exodus/38-26.htm">Exodus 38:26</a> and in <a href="/numbers/1-46.htm">Numbers 1:46</a> are really independent, and that therefore no one belonging to any other tribe than that of Levi had died in the interval. As that assumption is untenable (see above on chapter Numbers 1:46), so this "coincidence" falls to the ground. We know indeed that Mishael and Elizaphan were defiled at this time, and we do not know that any one else was; but, on the other hand, the words "the dead body of a man" seem to point to a single corpse only. <span class="cmt_word">Dead body.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, as in <a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/6-11.htm">Numbers 6:11</a>, and other places.
