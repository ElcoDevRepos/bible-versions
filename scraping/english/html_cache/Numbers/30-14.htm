Silence from the husband regarding his wife's vows could be interpreted as tacit approval. This reflects the patriarchal structure of the society, where the husband had the final say in family matters. The phrase "from day to day" suggests a period of consideration, indicating that the husband had time to reflect on the vows before making a decision. This concept of silence as consent is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in the story of Eli and his sons (<a href="/1_samuel/3-13.htm">1 Samuel 3:13</a>), where Eli's failure to restrain his sons is seen as implicit approval of their actions.<p><b>then he confirms all the vows and pledges that bind her</b><br>The confirmation of vows by the husband underscores the seriousness of making vows before God. In biblical times, vows were considered binding and sacred, often involving a promise to God or a commitment to perform a specific act. The husband's role in confirming these vows highlights the importance of mutual agreement and accountability within the marriage covenant. This principle of confirmation is seen in the New Testament as well, where Jesus teaches about the importance of fulfilling one's word (<a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>).<p><b>He has confirmed them, because he said nothing to her on the day he heard about them</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the responsibility of the husband to respond promptly to his wife's vows. By not speaking up on the day he hears of them, he effectively endorses them. This reflects the biblical principle that inaction can be as significant as action, a theme seen throughout Scripture. For example, in <a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>, it is stated that failing to do what one knows is right is considered sin. The immediacy of the husband's response is crucial, as it prevents any ambiguity regarding the status of the vows. This principle of immediate response can be seen as a type of Christ, who, as the bridegroom of the Church, affirms and fulfills the promises made to His people without delay.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received and communicated God's laws, including those concerning vows.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws were given, living in the wilderness during their journey to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/husband.htm">Husband</a></b><br>The male figure in a marriage who holds authority in confirming or nullifying his wife's vows.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wife.htm">Wife</a></b><br>The female figure in a marriage who may make vows or pledges, subject to her husband's confirmation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vows_and_pledges.htm">Vows and Pledges</a></b><br>Commitments made by individuals, which in this context, require the husband's confirmation or nullification.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_authority_in_marriage.htm">The Role of Authority in Marriage</a></b><br>The passage highlights the husband's role in confirming or nullifying vows, emphasizing the biblical structure of authority within marriage.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_communication.htm">The Importance of Communication</a></b><br>The husband's silence is a form of communication that confirms the vow.
