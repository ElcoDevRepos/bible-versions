This tribe was unique as it was split into two half-tribes, one settling on the east side of the Jordan River and the other on the west. This division is significant in understanding the geographical and political landscape of ancient Israel. The tribe's inheritance was large, reflecting the blessing Jacob gave to Joseph's sons in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>, where Manasseh was prophesied to become a great people.<p><b>according to the records of their clans and families</b><br>The Israelites maintained detailed genealogical records, which were crucial for establishing tribal identity, inheritance rights, and military organization. These records ensured that each clan and family within the tribe of Manasseh was accounted for, reflecting the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite society. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, emphasizing the continuity of God's promises to Abraham's descendants.<p><b>counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older</b><br>The age of twenty was significant as it marked the transition to adulthood and eligibility for military service. This census was not merely a population count but a preparation for war, as the Israelites were about to enter the Promised Land. The age requirement underscores the responsibility and maturity expected of those who would defend the nation. This practice is consistent with other ancient Near Eastern cultures, where young men were expected to serve in the military.<p><b>who could serve in the army</b><br>The primary purpose of this census was to assess military strength. The Israelites were organized into a fighting force as they prepared to conquer Canaan. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God as a divine warrior leading His people into battle, as seen in <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>. The military organization also foreshadows the spiritual battles Christians face, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where believers are called to put on the full armor of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_manasseh.htm">Sons of Manasseh</a></b><br>Manasseh was one of the tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son Manasseh.
