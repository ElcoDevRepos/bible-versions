It underscores Moses' role as a mediator between God and the people. This divine instruction reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's governance, where God's law is supreme.<p><b>The man must surely be put to death</b><br>The severity of the punishment highlights the importance of obedience to God's commandments, specifically the Sabbath law. In the context of <a href="/numbers/15.htm">Numbers 15</a>, this incident follows a section on unintentional sins, contrasting with the willful disobedience of the Sabbath breaker. The death penalty underscores the holiness of the Sabbath, a day set apart since creation (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>) and reiterated in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>).<p><b>The whole congregation is to stone him</b><br>Stoning was a communal act of execution, emphasizing collective responsibility in upholding God's law. It served as a deterrent and a means of purging evil from the community (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>). This method of execution is seen in other parts of the Old Testament for various offenses (<a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14-16</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/13-10.htm">Deuteronomy 13:10</a>).<p><b>outside the camp</b><br>Executing the punishment outside the camp signifies the removal of sin from the midst of the people, maintaining the purity of the camp where God's presence dwelt (<a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>, <a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12-13</a>).

It reminds us that &#8220;no prophecy of Scripture comes from one&#8217;s own interpretation&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene follows the discovery of a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath (<a href="/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32-34</a>). God&#8217;s answer will clear up any doubt about how seriously He takes His word&#8212;especially the Sabbath command first laid down in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The man must surely be put to death.&#8221;</b><p>Sin&#8217;s penalty is literal and severe because God is holy.<p>&#8226; Earlier, the Lord warned, &#8220;Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must surely be put to death&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/31-15.htm">Exodus 31:15</a>; also 35:2). The sentence in <a href="/bsb/numbers/15.htm">Numbers 15</a> is the faithful, consistent application of that statute.<p>&#8226; The harshness underlines a truth later stated in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>: &#8220;The wages of sin is death.&#8221; Physical execution in Israel foreshadows the eternal judgment all sin earns.<p>&#8226; Grace is never cheap; it is only seen clearly when the cost of breaking God&#8217;s law is faced honestly (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The whole congregation is to stone him&#8221;</b><p>Judgment involves the community, not a lone vigilante.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6-7</a> requires &#8220;two or three witnesses&#8221; and commands that &#8220;the hands of the witnesses shall be the first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people&#8221;. Corporate participation makes sure the verdict is verified and shared.<p>&#8226; Stoning was public, decisive, and preventive. It proclaimed, &#8220;As a community we will not tolerate rebellion&#8221; (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/13-11.htm">Deuteronomy 13:11</a>).<p>&#8226; New-Testament believers see a parallel in church discipline&#8212;still a corporate act, though now spiritual rather than judicial (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-4.htm">1 Corinthians 5:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;outside the camp.&#8221;</b><p>The place of execution reinforced separation from sin.<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a> uses the same wording when a blasphemer is punished: take him &#8220;outside the camp&#8221; before stoning. Anything unclean or rebellious was removed from the center of worship (<a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The location also previews Christ&#8217;s work: &#8220;And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to sanctify the people by His own blood&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>). Our Savior bore the curse in the very place of exclusion so that we could be brought in.<p>&#8226; For Israel, the camp symbolized God&#8217;s dwelling (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>). To be put out was to be cut off from blessing&#8212;a solemn warning that sin separates.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/15-35.htm">Numbers 15:35</a> gives God&#8217;s direct verdict on Sabbath breaking: death by stoning, carried out by the whole congregation, outside the camp. Each phrase drives home a lesson: God&#8217;s word is final; sin is deadly; covenant community must uphold holiness; and separation from God&#8217;s presence is the ultimate cost. The verse magnifies divine justice while pointing ahead to Christ, who would endure the penalty &#8220;outside the camp&#8221; so repentant sinners could forever rest in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Without the camp.</span> That it might not be defiled (cf. <a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>, and <a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/15-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
