In the context of ancient Israelite society, where community living was close-knit, sudden physical contact could easily occur. The law provided a way to differentiate between intentional and unintentional actions, reflecting God's justice and mercy. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes the importance of the heart's intent (<a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>).<p><b>without hostility</b><br>The absence of hostility is crucial in determining the nature of the act. In Hebrew culture, intent was as significant as the action itself. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that God judges the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The provision for cities of refuge in <a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a> was designed to protect those who caused harm unintentionally, highlighting God's provision for justice tempered with mercy.<p><b>or throws an object at him unintentionally</b><br>This clause further clarifies the nature of accidental harm. In ancient times, daily life involved many manual tasks, increasing the likelihood of accidents. The law's provision for unintentional actions underscores the importance of intent in God's justice system. This concept is mirrored in the teachings of Jesus, who often focused on the spirit of the law rather than the letter (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23-24</a>). The cities of refuge served as a type of Christ, offering protection and a place of safety for those who sought it, much like Christ offers refuge to sinners.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws in Numbers were given, as they were preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_of_refuge.htm">Cities of Refuge</a></b><br>Designated places where individuals who committed unintentional manslaughter could flee for safety until a fair trial.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_accidental_killer.htm">The Accidental Killer</a></b><br>A person who causes the death of another without premeditation or malice, as described in this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_avenger_of_blood.htm">The Avenger of Blood</a></b><br>A family member of the deceased who had the right to seek justice, often through retribution, unless the killer reached a city of refuge.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who conveyed God's laws, including those about cities of refuge, to the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_intent.htm">Understanding Intent</a></b><br>This verse highlights the importance of discerning intent in actions.
