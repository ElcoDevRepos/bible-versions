Unlike the other tribes of Israel, they did not receive a portion of the land as their inheritance. Instead, their inheritance was the service of God and the provision through the tithes of the people. This reflects the principle that those who serve in spiritual matters are supported by the community they serve, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>, where Paul discusses the rights of those who preach the gospel to receive their living from it.<p><b>the tithe that the Israelites present to the LORD as a contribution.</b><br>The tithe, a tenth of the produce and livestock, was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures, but in Israel, it was specifically dedicated to the LORD. This tithe was a recognition of God's provision and sovereignty. The Levites, in turn, were to offer a tithe of the tithe to the priests, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/18-26.htm">Numbers 18:26-28</a>. This system ensured that the needs of those who ministered before the LORD were met, while also maintaining a sense of communal responsibility and worship.<p><b>That is why I told them that they would not receive an inheritance among the Israelites.</b><br>The Levites' lack of a territorial inheritance emphasized their unique role and dependence on God and the community. This arrangement foreshadowed the New Testament teaching that believers are a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), with their inheritance being spiritual rather than material. The Levites' reliance on the tithes of the people is a type of Christ, who, though He had no place to lay His head (<a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>), relied on the provision of those who followed Him. This also points to the eternal inheritance believers have in Christ, which is not of this world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service in the Tabernacle.
