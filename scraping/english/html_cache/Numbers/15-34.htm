The Mosaic Law, given at Mount Sinai, included the commandment to keep the Sabbath holy (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>), but specific penalties for violations were not always detailed. This situation underscores the need for divine guidance in applying the law, reflecting the Israelites' dependence on God's direction. It also illustrates the developing nature of the legal system in ancient Israel, where precedents were being established. The lack of a declared punishment indicates the seriousness with which the community approached adherence to God's commandments, seeking clarity from God rather than acting on their own assumptions.<p><b>they placed him in custody</b><br>The act of placing the man in custody shows the community's respect for due process and the seriousness of the offense. In ancient Israel, custody was not a form of punishment but a temporary measure to ensure order while awaiting a decision from God or Moses. This reflects a judicial process that values deliberation and divine consultation. The Israelites' legal system was theocratic, meaning that God was the ultimate authority, and Moses, as God's appointed leader, was responsible for seeking His will. This incident foreshadows the New Testament principle of seeking God's wisdom in judgment (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). It also points to the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate judge and lawgiver, who fulfills the law and provides clarity and grace in its application (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_gathering_sticks.htm">The Man Gathering Sticks</a></b><br>This individual was found gathering sticks on the Sabbath, an act that led to his being placed in custody.

Those who found the man gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The Sabbath command was clear (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-12.htm">Deuteronomy 5:12-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The penalty for Sabbath profanation had already been stated: &#8220;Whoever does any work on it must surely be put to death&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet Israel had never faced a real-life case, so the community paused before acting. This pattern&#8212;stop, seek God&#8217;s will, then proceed&#8212;is also seen in situations like <a href="/numbers/27-5.htm">Numbers 27:5</a> and <a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because it had not been declared</b><p>&#8220;Because it had not been declared&#8221; highlights that, although the law announced death for Sabbath breaking, the exact procedure (how, when, and by whom) had not been specified for this new covenant community.<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/24-12.htm">Leviticus 24:12</a> shows the same wording when a blasphemer was detained &#8220;until the will of the LORD should be made clear.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-11</a> describes bringing difficult cases to spiritual leadership for clarification.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s revelation often unfolds step by step; He gives enough light for the moment while training His people to seek Him for further guidance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What should be done to him</b><p>The phrase underscores Israel&#8217;s desire to act only on God-given authority.<p>&#8226; Moses, the mediator (<a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>), would inquire of the LORD before issuing a verdict, ensuring perfect alignment with divine justice (<a href="/numbers/15-35.htm">Numbers 15:35</a>).<p>&#8226; This carefulness foreshadows New-Testament counsel to seek wisdom from above rather than leaning on human reasoning (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The process guards against impulsive or vengeful decisions, affirming that true justice originates with God (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They placed him in custody</b><p>Detention was temporary and protective, not punitive in itself.<p>&#8226; By restraining the man, Israel preserved community order while preventing an unauthorized execution (<a href="/proverbs/28-5.htm">Proverbs 28:5</a> contrasts rash action with seeking understanding).<p>&#8226; The principle resembles civil &#8220;due process,&#8221; rooted in God&#8217;s character of order (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Holding the man also allowed the whole congregation to witness God&#8217;s verdict, reinforcing communal responsibility (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-11.htm">Deuteronomy 13:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Application for today</b><p>&#8226; Scripture remains the final authority; when situations arise that seem unclear, believers pause and search the Word, inviting God&#8217;s guidance through prayer and godly counsel (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>; <a href="/acts/15-15.htm">Acts 15:15-18</a>).<p>&#8226; God values both justice and mercy; He calls His people to act responsibly, neither ignoring sin nor rushing to condemn (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/john/7-24.htm">John 7:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The passage reminds modern readers that obedience is not merely rule-keeping but a relationship of listening to the Lord&#8217;s specific direction (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/15-34.htm">Numbers 15:34</a> shows Israel pausing between discovery of sin and execution of judgment.
