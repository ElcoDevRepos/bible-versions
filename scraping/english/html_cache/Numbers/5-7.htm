In the Old Testament, confession was often a public acknowledgment of wrongdoing, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/5-5.htm">Leviticus 5:5</a> and <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19-20</a>. This act of confession is not merely verbal but involves a genuine recognition of one's transgressions. The requirement for confession underscores the importance of transparency and humility in the community of Israel. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching in 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, where confession is linked to forgiveness and cleansing through Christ.<p><b>He must make full restitution,</b><br>Restitution is a key aspect of justice in the Mosaic Law, reflecting God's concern for fairness and restoration. The principle of restitution is seen throughout the Pentateuch, such as in <a href="/exodus/22.htm">Exodus 22:1-14</a>, where specific guidelines are given for compensating losses. This requirement ensures that the wronged party is made whole, highlighting the value of relationships and community integrity. Restitution also points to the broader biblical theme of reconciliation, which is ultimately fulfilled in Christ's atoning work, restoring humanity's relationship with God.<p><b>add a fifth to its value,</b><br>The addition of a fifth (20%) to the restitution amount serves as a deterrent against wrongdoing and an incentive for honesty. This extra payment acknowledges the inconvenience and potential loss suffered by the wronged party. The principle of adding a fifth is also found in <a href="/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5 and 27</a>:13, 15, 19, 31, indicating its importance in the legal system of ancient Israel. This practice reflects God's justice and mercy, ensuring that the offender takes responsibility while providing for the victim's needs.<p><b>and give all this to the one he has wronged.</b><br>The directive to give restitution directly to the wronged party emphasizes personal responsibility and the restoration of relationships. This act of giving is not just a legal obligation but a step towards reconciliation and healing within the community. It reflects the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>. In the New Testament, Jesus expands on this idea in <a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>, teaching that reconciliation with others is essential for true worship. This principle is a precursor to the ultimate reconciliation offered through Christ, who restores believers to God and each other.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws in Numbers were given, representing God's chosen nation and their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God and communicated them to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wrongdoer.htm">The Wrongdoer</a></b><br>An individual among the Israelites who has committed a sin against another person, requiring confession and restitution.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wronged_party.htm">The Wronged Party</a></b><br>The individual who has been wronged or harmed by the actions of the wrongdoer, entitled to compensation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites, where confessions and offerings were made.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_confession.htm">The Importance of Confession</a></b><br>Confession is a crucial step in the process of repentance and reconciliation.
