It highlights a pattern of behavior that is being repeated by the current generation. The "fathers" here are the spies sent by Moses to explore Canaan, whose report led to the Israelites' rebellion and subsequent 40-year wandering in the desert (Numbers 13-14). This serves as a warning against repeating past mistakes and emphasizes the importance of faith and obedience to God's commands.<p><b>when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea</b><br>Kadesh-barnea is a significant location in the wilderness journey of the Israelites. It served as a major encampment and a launching point for the exploration of the Promised Land. Geographically, it is located in the northeastern part of the Sinai Peninsula. Historically, it was here that the Israelites faced a critical test of faith. The mention of Kadesh-barnea underscores the gravity of the situation and the direct involvement of God in guiding His people. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience, as the failure at Kadesh-barnea led to a generation being denied entry into the Promised Land.<p><b>to inspect the land.</b><br>The inspection of the land was a mission to assess the Promised Land's resources and inhabitants. This task was meant to prepare the Israelites for the conquest of Canaan. However, the negative report by ten of the twelve spies led to fear and rebellion among the people (<a href="/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31-33</a>). This inspection was not merely a reconnaissance mission but a test of faith in God's promise. The failure to trust in God's provision and power resulted in severe consequences. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise through Jesus Christ, who leads believers into the true Promised Land, symbolizing eternal life and rest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is addressing the tribes of Reuben and Gad in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben_and_gad.htm">Reuben and Gad</a></b><br>Two tribes of Israel requesting to settle on the east side of the Jordan River instead of crossing into the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kadesh-barnea.htm">Kadesh-barnea</a></b><br>A significant location in the wilderness where the Israelites previously camped and from where the spies were sent to explore Canaan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>Representatives from each tribe sent to scout the Promised Land, whose report influenced the Israelites' faith and actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_unbelief.htm">The Consequences of Unbelief</a></b><br>The Israelites' failure to trust God at Kadesh-barnea led to a generation missing out on the Promised Land.

At the same time it is obviously the more natural, and the more in accordance with facts, because there was not a man left of all those who had rebelled at Kadesh. At Kadesh-Barnea. This mode of writing the name forms a link between the closing chapters of Numbers (here and in <a href="/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4</a>) and the two following books. In Deuteronomy it occurs four times, and "Kadesh" twice. In Joshua "Kadesh-Barnea" occurs exclusively. In the later books "Kadesh" only is used, as in Genesis and in the previous chapters of Numbers. The meaning of the combination is uncertain, and the etymology of "Barnea" altogether obscure. It may be an old name attaching to the place before it became known as a sanctuary.
