Aaron, as the first high priest, holds a unique position in Israel's religious structure. This direct address underscores the personal responsibility and accountability of Aaron and his lineage in their sacred duties. The LORD speaking directly to Aaron highlights the divine origin of the priestly role and its responsibilities.<p><b>You and your sons and your father&#8217;s house must bear the iniquity involving the sanctuary</b><br>Here, "you and your sons and your father&#8217;s house" refers to Aaron, his immediate family, and the broader Levitical family. The term "bear the iniquity" suggests a responsibility for any sins or transgressions related to the sanctuary. This responsibility includes ensuring the sanctity and proper functioning of the tabernacle, which was central to Israelite worship. The sanctuary, as the dwelling place of God's presence, required strict adherence to divine instructions, and any failure in this regard would result in serious consequences. This phrase underscores the gravity of the priestly duties and the need for holiness in approaching God.<p><b>And you and your sons alone must bear the iniquity involving your priesthood</b><br>This phrase narrows the focus to Aaron and his sons, emphasizing their exclusive responsibility for the priestly duties. The priesthood was a sacred office with specific roles, such as offering sacrifices and maintaining the rituals prescribed by the Law. The exclusivity of this responsibility highlights the separation between the priestly class and the rest of the Israelites, reinforcing the idea of holiness and consecration. This separation is a type of Christ, who as the ultimate High Priest, bears the iniquity of humanity and mediates between God and man. The phrase also points to the seriousness of the priestly office, as any failure in their duties would have direct spiritual consequences for the nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks directly to Aaron, establishing His authority and the divine origin of the instructions given.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel, representing the priestly line and the responsibilities associated with it.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron's_sons.htm">Aaron's Sons</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron who are also priests, sharing in the responsibilities and duties of the priesthood.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron's_father's_house.htm">Aaron's Father's House</a></b><br>Refers to the Levites, the tribe from which Aaron comes, who are set apart for service in the sanctuary.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary.htm">The Sanctuary</a></b><br>The holy place where God dwells among His people, requiring careful and reverent service to maintain its sanctity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_and_accountability.htm">Responsibility and Accountability</a></b><br>Aaron and his sons are held accountable for the sanctuary and their priesthood.

There is, however, no direct reference to those events, and it is quite possible that the only connection was one of subject-matter in the mind of the writer. That the regulations which follow were addressed to Aaron directly is a thing unusual, and indeed unexampled. The ever-recurring statement elsewhere is, "the Lord spake unto Moses," varied occasionally by "the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron" (as in <a href="/numbers/2-1.htm">Numbers 2:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-1.htm">Numbers 4:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-1.htm">Numbers 19:1</a>); but even where the communication refers to things wholly and peculiarly within the province of Aaron, it is usually made to Moses, and only through him to his brother (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/numbers/8-1.htm">Numbers 8:1-3</a>). This change in the form of the message may point to a later date, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to a time subsequent to the gainsaying of Korah, when the separate position of Aaron as the head of a priestly caste was more fully recognized than before, and he himself somewhat less under the shadow of his greater brother. <span class="cmt_word">Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the sanctuary.</span> Aaron's father's house, according to the analogy of <a href="/numbers/17-2.htm">Numbers 17:2, 3, 6</a>, was the sub-tribe of the Kohathites, and these had charge (to the exclusion of the other Levites) of the sanctuary, or rather sacred things (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, as in <a href="/numbers/10-21.htm">Numbers 10:21</a>. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). See on Numbers 4:15. This mention of the Kohathites in connection with the sanctuary is an incidental proof that these instructions were given in view of the wanderings in the wilderness, for after the settlement in Canaan no Levites (as such) came into contact with the sacred furniture. It is not easy to define exactly the meaning of "shall bear the iniquity (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) of the sanctuary." The general sense of the phrase is, "to be responsible for the iniquity," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, for anything which caused displeasure in the eyes of God, "in connection with the sacred things and the service of them;" hence it meant either to be responsible for such iniquity, as being held accountable for it, and having to endure the penalty, or as being permitted and enabled to take such accountability on oneself, and so discharge it from others. This double sense is exactly reflected in the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, as applied to our Lord (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The priests, therefore (and the Kohathites, so far as they had anything to do with the sanctuary), were responsible for all the unholiness attaching or accruing to it, not only by reason of all offences committed by themselves, but by reason of that imperfection which clung to them at the best, and made them unworthy to handle the things of God. In a further and deeper sense they might be said to be vicariously responsible for all the iniquity of all Israel, so far as the taint of it affected the very sanctuary (see on Exodus 28:38; Leviticus 16:16). <span class="cmt_word">The iniquity of your priesthood.</span> The responsibility not only for all sinful acts of omission and commission in Divine service (such as those of Nadab and Abihu, and of Korah), but for all the inevitable failure of personal holiness on the part of those who ministered unto the Lord. This responsibility was emphatically recognized and provided for in the rites of the great day of atonement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/18-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
