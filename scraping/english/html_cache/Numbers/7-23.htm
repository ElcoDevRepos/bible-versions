Oxen were valuable animals, symbolizing strength and service, and their use in offerings indicated a significant sacrifice. This offering was part of the dedication of the altar, reflecting the Israelites' desire for peace and fellowship with God. The use of two oxen underscores the importance of the occasion and the wealth of the tribe of Issachar, represented by Nethanel.<p><b>five rams</b><br>Rams were often used in sacrificial offerings and symbolized leadership and authority. The number five can represent grace or God's goodness in biblical numerology. The inclusion of five rams in the offering highlights the tribe's acknowledgment of God's grace and their submission to His authority. Rams were also used in the consecration of priests, linking this offering to the priestly service and dedication to God.<p><b>five male goats</b><br>Goats were commonly used in sin offerings, symbolizing the removal of sin and impurity. The number five again emphasizes grace. The presence of five male goats in the peace offering suggests a recognition of the need for purification and atonement, even in the context of thanksgiving and fellowship. This reflects the comprehensive nature of the offerings, addressing both sin and gratitude.<p><b>and five male lambs a year old</b><br>Lambs, especially those a year old, were considered pure and without blemish, making them suitable for sacrifice. The use of five lambs further emphasizes the theme of grace. Lambs are often seen as a type of Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). This offering foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, highlighting the peace and reconciliation He brings between God and humanity.<p><b>This was the offering of Nethanel son of Zuar.</b><br>Nethanel, the leader of the tribe of Issachar, presents this offering on behalf of his tribe. Issachar was known for its wisdom and understanding of the times (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>). Nethanel's offering reflects the tribe's devotion and commitment to God. The mention of his father, Zuar, emphasizes the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite culture, underscoring the continuity of faith and obedience across generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nashon.htm">Nashon</a></b><br>The leader of the tribe of Judah, who brought the offering described in this verse.

Nethanel&#8217;s gift mirrors those of the other tribal leaders, reinforcing unity and wholehearted worship as Israel dedicated the altar.
