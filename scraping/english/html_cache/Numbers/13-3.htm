The LORD's command signifies His sovereign will and purpose for Israel. It reflects the consistent biblical theme of God directing His people, as seen in other instances such as the calling of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>) and the instructions given to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1.htm">Joshua 1:1-9</a>). This command underscores the importance of obedience to God's directives, a recurring theme throughout Scripture.<p><b>Moses sent them out</b><br>Moses, as the leader and prophet of Israel, acts in obedience to God's command. His role as a mediator between God and the people is highlighted here, similar to his intercessory role in <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>. This action also prefigures the sending out of the apostles by Jesus in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5-6</a>), where leaders are sent to fulfill God's mission.<p><b>from the Wilderness of Paran</b><br>The Wilderness of Paran is a significant geographical location in the journey of the Israelites. It is situated in the Sinai Peninsula, serving as a staging ground for the exploration of Canaan. This wilderness experience is part of the broader narrative of Israel's 40-year journey, reflecting themes of testing and reliance on God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-5</a>. Archaeological evidence suggests this area was a well-traveled route, supporting the biblical account of Israel's movements.<p><b>All the men were leaders of the Israelites</b><br>The selection of leaders indicates the importance of the mission. These men were not ordinary individuals but recognized leaders, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. This mirrors the structure seen in <a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>, where capable men were chosen to lead. The leadership role here is crucial, as it involves responsibility and accountability, paralleling the New Testament concept of church leadership (<a href="/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3:1-7</a>). The leaders' failure to trust in God's promise later in the chapter serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of unbelief and disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

The verb highlights that Moses did not act on a whim but in full obedience.<p>&#8226; Throughout Israel&#8217;s journey, divine initiative guides every major step (<a href="/exodus/40-36.htm">Exodus 40:36-38</a>; <a href="/numbers/9-18.htm">Numbers 9:18-23</a>). When the cloud moved, the camp moved; when God spoke, Moses responded.<p>&#8226; The emphasis on God&#8217;s word reassures us that the upcoming reconnaissance is not human presumption but a faith-building opportunity prepared by the LORD (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-20.htm">Deuteronomy 1:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; By obeying the command, Moses models leadership that listens first to God, echoing earlier moments when he acted only at God&#8217;s directive (<a href="/exodus/17-5.htm">Exodus 17:5-6</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-7.htm">Numbers 20:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moses sent them out from the Wilderness of Paran</b><p>&#8226; Paran marks a strategic staging ground on the southern edge of Canaan (<a href="/numbers/10-12.htm">Numbers 10:12</a>; 12:16). God had already showcased His provision there with the giving of quail (<a href="/exodus/16-13.htm">Exodus 16:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Sending from Paran underlines that Israel was poised on the threshold of promise&#8212;close enough to see it, yet still needing faith to enter (<a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The physical movement from wasteland to promised land mirrors the spiritual journey from slavery to inheritance, echoing God&#8217;s earlier pledge in <a href="/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>.<p>&#8226; Moses, acting as shepherd-leader (<a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>), coordinates the advance, demonstrating orderly progression rather than chaotic impulse (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a> draws the same principle for the church).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the men were leaders of the Israelites</b><p>&#8226; God instructs Moses to choose one representative from each tribe (<a href="/numbers/13-2.htm">Numbers 13:2</a>). This ensures the scouting party carries full authority and credibility when reporting back (<a href="/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26-30</a>).<p>&#8226; These men are called &#8220;leaders,&#8221; signaling seasoned, trustworthy figures, similar to the tribal chiefs listed in <a href="/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4-16</a>. Their selection shows that God values strong, accountable leadership structures.<p>&#8226; By involving leaders, the LORD allows every tribe to participate corporately in the step of faith. No tribe can later claim ignorance or exclusion (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-22.htm">Deuteronomy 1:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; The eventual mixed report from these leaders (<a href="/numbers/14-1.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>) illustrates the sobering truth that even spiritual leadership must choose between fear and faith, a lesson echoed in <a href="/1_timothy/4-16.htm">1 Timothy 4:16</a> regarding watchfulness in leaders.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/13-3.htm">Numbers 13:3</a> records an obedient response to God&#8217;s directive, a strategic launch point from Paran, and the deployment of recognized tribal leaders. Together these details underscore that the forthcoming exploration of Canaan is God-initiated, orderly, and representative. The verse sets a high standard: God speaks, His people move, and their leaders shoulder responsibility&#8212;principles that still guide faithful living today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And Moses, by the commandment of the Lord, sent them, &c.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">And Moses sent them, from the wilderness of Paran, according to the command </span>(literally, the mouth) <span class= "ital">of the Lord, i.e., </span>as appears from <a href="/deuteronomy/1-19.htm" title="And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us;
