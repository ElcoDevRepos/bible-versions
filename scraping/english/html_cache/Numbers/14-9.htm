Rebellion against the LORD is seen as a grave sin, as it reflects a lack of trust and faith in His promises. In the context of <a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>, the Israelites are on the brink of entering the Promised Land, and their rebellion is a refusal to trust in God's plan. This echoes the rebellion of Adam and Eve in Genesis, where disobedience led to separation from God. The call to not rebel is a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and His people, where obedience is a sign of faithfulness.<p><b>and do not be afraid of the people of the land</b><br>Fear is a natural human response, but in the biblical context, it often signifies a lack of faith in God's power and promises. The "people of the land" refers to the inhabitants of Canaan, who were perceived as giants and formidable foes. This phrase encourages the Israelites to trust in God's strength rather than their own. It parallels the exhortation in <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, where God commands Joshua to be strong and courageous. The call to not fear is a reminder that God is sovereign over all nations and peoples.<p><b>for they will be like bread for us</b><br>This metaphor suggests that the Canaanites will be easily defeated and consumed, much like bread is eaten. It conveys confidence in God's promise to give the Israelites victory. The imagery of bread also connects to the provision of manna in the wilderness, symbolizing God's sustenance and faithfulness. This phrase foreshadows the eventual conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership, where God's promise is fulfilled.<p><b>Their protection has been removed</b><br>This indicates that the divine favor or protection that the Canaanites might have had is no longer present. In the ancient Near Eastern context, cities and peoples were often thought to be under the protection of their gods. The removal of protection signifies that the true God, the LORD, has determined their defeat. This aligns with the biblical theme that God is the ultimate authority over all spiritual and earthly powers.<p><b>and the LORD is with us</b><br>The presence of the LORD with the Israelites is a central theme in their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. It reassures them of divine support and guidance. This presence is symbolized by the Ark of the Covenant and the pillar of cloud and fire. The assurance of God's presence is a source of strength and courage, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like David, who declared in <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a> that he would fear no evil because God was with him. This presence is ultimately fulfilled in the New Testament with the coming of Jesus Christ, Emmanuel, meaning "God with us."<p><b>Do not be afraid of them!</b><br>The repetition of the command to not fear underscores its importance. Fear can paralyze and prevent the fulfillment of God's promises. This command is a call to faith and action, trusting in God's power rather than succumbing to human weakness. It reflects the biblical principle that faith in God casts out fear, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/4-18.htm">John 4:18</a>. The exhortation to not fear is a timeless message for believers facing challenges, reminding them of God's sovereignty and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and are now on the brink of entering the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua_and_caleb.htm">Joshua and Caleb</a></b><br>Two of the twelve spies sent to scout the land of Canaan.
