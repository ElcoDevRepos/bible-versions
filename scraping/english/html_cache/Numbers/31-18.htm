The sparing of certain individuals reflects the ancient practice of taking captives in warfare, which was common in the Near Eastern cultures. It also highlights the concept of spoils of war, where victors would take people and goods as part of their conquest. This directive is part of a larger narrative where God commands Moses to take vengeance on the Midianites for leading Israel into idolatry and immorality (Numbers 25). The sparing of certain individuals can be seen as a form of mercy or practical necessity, as these captives could be integrated into Israelite society.<p><b>every girl who has never had relations with a man</b><br>This specification serves a dual purpose. Culturally, it reflects the importance placed on virginity and purity in ancient Israelite society. Virgins were often seen as more easily assimilated into the community, as they had not been involved in the idolatrous practices of the Midianites. Historically, this practice ensured that those who were spared were not complicit in the previous seduction and idolatry that led Israel astray. Theologically, this can be seen as a measure to maintain the holiness and distinctiveness of the Israelite community. In a broader biblical context, the concept of purity and separation from sin is a recurring theme, pointing towards the need for a holy people set apart for God. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate pure and spotless sacrifice, emphasizing the need for purity in those who are part of God's covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received and conveyed God's commands regarding the Midianites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that opposed Israel and led them into idolatry and immorality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were commanded to execute judgment on the Midianites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/phinehas.htm">Phinehas</a></b><br>The priest who played a significant role in the battle against the Midianites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/war_against_midian.htm">War against Midian</a></b><br>A divinely commanded conflict as a judgment against the Midianites for their role in leading Israel into sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_justice.htm">Understanding Divine Justice</a></b><br>The command in <a href="/numbers/31-18.htm">Numbers 31:18</a> reflects God's justice and holiness.
