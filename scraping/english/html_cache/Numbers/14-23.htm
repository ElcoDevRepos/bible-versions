After their lack of faith and rebellion against God at Kadesh Barnea, they were condemned to wander in the wilderness for 40 years. The "land" is the Promised Land, Canaan, which God had promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This punishment underscores the seriousness of unbelief and disobedience to God&#8217;s commands. It serves as a warning to future generations about the consequences of not trusting in God's promises.<p><b>that I swore to give their fathers</b><br>The promise of the land was a covenant made by God with the patriarchs, beginning with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>. This covenant was reiterated to Isaac and Jacob, establishing a perpetual promise of a homeland for their descendants. The use of "swore" emphasizes the solemnity and certainty of God's promise, highlighting His faithfulness despite human unfaithfulness. This covenant is foundational to the identity of Israel as God's chosen people and is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>None of those who have treated Me with contempt</b><br>The phrase "treated Me with contempt" refers to the Israelites' repeated acts of rebellion and lack of faith, particularly their refusal to enter the Promised Land after the report of the spies (Numbers 13-14). This contempt is seen as a direct affront to God's character and His ability to fulfill His promises. The Hebrew term used here conveys a deep disrespect and rejection of God's authority. This serves as a reminder of the importance of reverence and trust in one's relationship with God.<p><b>will see it</b><br>The consequence of their contempt is that they will not enter the Promised Land. This is a direct result of their actions and serves as a divine judgment. The only exceptions to this decree were Caleb and Joshua, who demonstrated faith and trust in God. This outcome illustrates the principle of divine justice and the importance of faithfulness. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that unbelief can prevent one from entering into God's rest, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as an inheritance for their descendants.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and towards the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/caleb_and_joshua.htm">Caleb and Joshua</a></b><br>The two spies who trusted in God's promise and encouraged the Israelites to take possession of the land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites wandered for 40 years as a consequence of their unbelief and disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_unbelief.htm">The Consequences of Unbelief</a></b><br>Unbelief in God's promises leads to missing out on His blessings.
