The context is a divine command to execute judgment on the Midianites for their role in leading Israel into idolatry and immorality (Numbers 25). Sparing the women, particularly those who had led Israel into sin, was contrary to the instructions given by God. This highlights the seriousness of sin and the need for complete obedience to God's commands. <p><b>he asked them.</b><br>Moses, as the leader and prophet of Israel, is the one questioning the soldiers. His role is to ensure that God's commands are followed precisely. This moment underscores the importance of leadership accountability and the responsibility of leaders to guide their people in righteousness. Moses' inquiry reflects his concern for the spiritual purity of the nation and the potential consequences of disobedience.
