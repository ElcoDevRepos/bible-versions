They did not receive a land inheritance like the other tribes but were given cities to live in and were supported by the tithes of the people.

This system ensured that those who served in the temple and performed religious duties were provided for. The tithe was considered holy and belonged to God, reflecting the principle that all provision ultimately comes from Him.<p><b>You must present part of it as an offering to the LORD:</b><br>The Levites, though recipients of the tithe, were also required to give a portion back to God. This offering was a demonstration of their own dependence on God and acknowledgment of His provision. It served as a reminder that everyone, regardless of their role, is called to honor God with their resources.<p><b>A tithe of the tithe:</b><br>This phrase indicates that the Levites were to give a tenth of what they received from the Israelites. It underscores the principle of giving back to God from what He has provided, a practice that is echoed in the New Testament teachings on generosity and stewardship. This act of giving by the Levites can be seen as a type of Christ, who, though He was rich, became poor for our sake, giving Himself fully to God&#8217;s service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe in Israel set apart for religious duties and service in the Tabernacle.
