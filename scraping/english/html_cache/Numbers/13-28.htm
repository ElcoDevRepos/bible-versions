It signals a shift from the positive aspects of the land to the challenges that the Israelites would face. This reflects a common biblical theme where faith is tested by seemingly insurmountable obstacles.<p><b>the people living in the land are strong</b><br>The Canaanites were known for their strength and military prowess. Historical records and archaeological findings suggest that the Canaanite city-states were well-established with formidable armies. This statement reflects the fear and intimidation felt by the Israelite spies, highlighting the human tendency to focus on obstacles rather than God's promises.<p><b>and the cities are large and fortified</b><br>Canaanite cities were often built on elevated sites with strong defensive walls, as confirmed by archaeological excavations at sites like Jericho and Hazor. These fortifications were a significant deterrent to ancient armies, emphasizing the daunting task ahead for the Israelites. This phrase underscores the need for divine intervention, as seen in later biblical narratives where God delivers these cities into Israel's hands.<p><b>We even saw the descendants of Anak there</b><br>The Anakim were a race of giants mentioned in several Old Testament passages. Their presence in Canaan added to the fear of the spies, as they were perceived as invincible warriors. This reference connects to earlier biblical accounts of giants, such as in <a href="/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>, and foreshadows later encounters with giants, like Goliath. The mention of Anakim also serves as a type of the spiritual giants or challenges believers face, which can only be overcome through faith in God's power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and are now on the brink of entering the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>Twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel, sent by Moses to scout the land of Canaan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_canaan.htm">The Land of Canaan</a></b><br>The Promised Land that God had assured to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_descendants_of_anak.htm">The Descendants of Anak</a></b><br>A race of giants known for their formidable size and strength, causing fear among the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who sent the spies to explore Canaan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_fear.htm">Faith Over Fear</a></b><br>The report of the spies highlights the challenge of choosing faith over fear.
