The prohibition against wine and strong drink signifies a call to holiness and separation from worldly pleasures. In ancient Israel, wine was a common part of daily life and religious ceremonies, symbolizing joy and celebration. By abstaining, the Nazirite demonstrates a focus on spiritual matters over physical indulgence. This abstention can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament call for believers to be filled with the Spirit rather than with wine (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>).<p><b>He must not drink vinegar made from wine or strong drink,</b><br>Vinegar, a byproduct of wine fermentation, was used in ancient times for various purposes, including as a condiment and preservative. The inclusion of vinegar in the prohibition underscores the comprehensive nature of the Nazirite vow, extending beyond the obvious intoxicants to any derivative of wine or strong drink. This reflects a broader principle of avoiding even the appearance of indulgence in substances that could lead to a compromised spiritual state. The meticulous nature of this command highlights the seriousness of the vow and the dedication required to maintain it.<p><b>and he must not drink any grape juice or eat fresh grapes or raisins.</b><br>The restriction against consuming any form of grapes, including juice, fresh grapes, or raisins, further emphasizes the Nazirite's total separation from the vine and its products. Grapes were a staple in the diet of the Israelites, and their prohibition signifies a deeper level of consecration. This abstention can be seen as a symbolic act of renouncing earthly pleasures and comforts to focus entirely on one's relationship with God. The comprehensive nature of this restriction points to the idea of purity and dedication, themes that resonate throughout Scripture, such as in the call to be holy as God is holy (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>). The Nazirite vow, in its entirety, foreshadows the ultimate consecration and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who lived a life fully dedicated to the will of the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazirite.htm">Nazirite</a></b><br>A person who takes a special vow of consecration to the Lord, which includes abstaining from wine and strong drink, as described in <a href="/bsb/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the Nazirite vow.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God to whom the laws, including the Nazirite vow, were given as they journeyed through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites received the law, including the instructions for the Nazirite vow.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where the Nazirite would eventually present offerings at the end of their vow.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consecration_to_god.htm">Consecration to God</a></b><br>The Nazirite vow is a powerful symbol of total dedication and separation unto the Lord.

This first prohibition lays the foundation for the Nazirite&#8217;s distinct lifestyle. Wine and other alcoholic beverages were common at meals (<a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14-15</a>) and celebrations (<a href="/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1-11</a>). By giving them up:<p>&#8226; The Nazirite signals a wholehearted devotion to God, much like priests who &#8220;must not drink wine or strong drink&#8221; before entering the tent of meeting (<a href="/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The choice models self-control, a virtue echoed in <a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> and reiterated for leaders in <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2-3</a>.<p>&#8226; It also foreshadows believers&#8217; call to &#8220;present your bodies as a living sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>), setting aside even good gifts when they might dull spiritual focus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Must not drink vinegar made from wine or strong drink</b><p>The text tightens the restriction: &#8220;He must not drink vinegar made from wine or strong drink.&#8221; Vinegar in the ancient world came from the slow fermentation of wine or beer. For the Nazirite, even this derivative was off-limits. The detail prevents loopholes and underscores thorough separation. Similar care appears in Jesus&#8217; teaching that a small amount of leaven affects the whole batch (<a href="/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6-12</a>), urging vigilance in what we allow into our lives. <a href="/proverbs/31-4.htm">Proverbs 31:4-5</a> warns kings against anything that could &#8220;cloud judgment,&#8221; reinforcing why complete abstention matters when representing God to others.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Must not drink any grape juice</b><p>Before grapes ever ferment, their juice is also forbidden. By excluding the sweet, non-alcoholic version, the vow guards against every stage that could lead back to the forbidden drink. This reminds us of <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>, where desire conceives sin in small beginnings. The Nazirite&#8217;s example encourages cutting off temptations at the root, echoing Paul&#8217;s counsel to &#8220;make no provision for the flesh&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Must not eat fresh grapes or raisins</b><p>Finally, &#8220;or eat fresh grapes or raisins.&#8221; Grapes in their simplest form&#8212;plucked from the vine or dried for storage&#8212;are barred. Nothing from the vine may pass the Nazirite&#8217;s lips. The comprehensiveness of this ban illustrates that dedication to God touches seemingly harmless pleasures as well. Daniel&#8217;s choice of vegetables over the king&#8217;s delicacies (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8-16</a>) mirrors this level of commitment. Jesus later calls His followers to deny themselves, take up the cross daily, and follow Him (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>), showing that costly obedience marks genuine consecration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3</a> presents a layered call to renunciation&#8212;wine, strong drink, their vinegar, grape juice, fresh grapes, raisins&#8212;painting a vivid picture of total separation unto the Lord. Each tightening circle protects the Nazirite from compromise and teaches us that wholehearted devotion willingly surrenders legitimate pleasures for a higher purpose. In Christ we find both the model and the power to live lives set apart, &#8220;holy and blameless before Him&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink . . . --</span>The law of the Nazirite in this respect, as in regard to defilement from the dead, was more strict than that which was enjoined upon the priests, thus typifying the entire surrender of the heart and life to God, and freedom from the distraction of earthly ties. The ideal of this separation, however, was not that of a life of monastic seclusion, but of action, and of uninterrupted devotion to the Divine service. The priests were forbidden to drink wine, or strong drink, when they entered the tabernacle to perform service there, but were not prohibited the use of wine at other times. Strong drink (<span class= "ital">shecar</span>) is supposed to have been made of barley and dates or honey. The prohibition to eat any of the produce of the vine, even of that which was not intoxicating, seems designed to denote the entire consecration of the Nazirite to the Divine service, and the obligation which rested upon him to abstain from all the desires and delights of the flesh. The love of cakes made of raisins is coupled in <a href="/hosea/3-1.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.">Hosea 3:1</a> with idolatry.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Strong drink.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">shekar</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>; <a href="/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15</a>).
