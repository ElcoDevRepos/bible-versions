Their request could potentially demoralize the other tribes, echoing the earlier discouragement caused by the negative report of the ten spies in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13-14</a>. This highlights the importance of unity and collective faith in God's promises.<p><b>from crossing into the land</b><br>The "land" refers to Canaan, the Promised Land, which God had pledged to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). Crossing the Jordan River symbolized entering into the fulfillment of God's covenant. The act of crossing was not just a physical journey but a spiritual one, representing trust in God's provision and promises.<p><b>that the LORD has given them?</b><br>This emphasizes the divine origin of the promise. The land was a gift from God, underscoring His sovereignty and faithfulness. The use of "has given" indicates the certainty of God's promise, even before its physical possession. This reflects the biblical theme of God's faithfulness and the assurance of His promises, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, where faith is described as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is addressing the tribes of Reuben and Gad in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben_and_gad.htm">Reuben and Gad</a></b><br>Two tribes of Israel who requested to settle on the east side of the Jordan River instead of crossing into the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The collective people of Israel, whom God has promised to lead into the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>The geographical boundary that the Israelites must cross to enter the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_discouragement.htm">The Danger of Discouragement</a></b><br>Discouragement can spread quickly and prevent God's people from fulfilling His promises.
