This phrase highlights his role in communicating divine instructions. The context here is the Israelites' complaints about their hardships and desire for meat, which led to God's response. Moses' obedience in relaying God's words underscores the importance of faithful communication of divine revelation. This mirrors the role of prophets throughout the Old Testament, who were tasked with delivering God's messages, often in challenging circumstances. It also foreshadows the ultimate communication of God's word through Jesus Christ, who is described as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>and he gathered seventy of the elders of the people</b><br>The selection of seventy elders is significant, as it represents a structured leadership within the Israelite community. The number seventy is often associated with completeness and order in biblical numerology. This gathering of elders can be seen as a precursor to the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, which also consisted of seventy members. The elders were chosen to assist Moses in governing the people, reflecting the need for shared leadership and the distribution of responsibilities. This concept of shared leadership is echoed in the New Testament, where the apostles appoint deacons to help with the growing needs of the early church (<a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-6</a>).<p><b>and had them stand around the tent</b><br>The tent referred to here is the Tent of Meeting, where Moses would go to speak with God. This location is significant as it represents the presence of God among His people. By having the elders stand around the tent, it symbolizes their proximity to God's presence and their role in mediating His will to the people. This act of standing around the tent can be seen as a form of consecration or commissioning for their new responsibilities. It also points to the idea of being in God's presence as a source of empowerment for leadership, a theme that is prevalent throughout Scripture, including the empowerment of the apostles at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.
