The spiritual battle against deceit is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the need for discernment and vigilance.<p><b>when they seduced you in the matter of Peor</b><br>The seduction at Peor involved the Israelites being lured into idolatry and immorality, as described in <a href="/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>.

The Midianites&#8217; attack was not a frontal military assault; it was a stealthy, moral ambush.<p>&#8226; Scripture often warns that the most dangerous opposition to God&#8217;s people comes through deception rather than force (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>).<p>&#8226; God exposes the tactic so Israel will recognize that spiritual warfare can look like friendship, romance, or cultural accommodation rather than swords and shields.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When they seduced you in the matter of Peor</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The matter of Peor&#8221; refers to the idolatrous revelry at Baal-peor, where Israel &#8220;joined in worshiping the Baal of Peor, and the LORD&#8217;s anger burned against them&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/25-3.htm">Numbers 25:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Seduction combined sexual immorality with idol worship, blending physical temptation and false religion (<a href="/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-28.htm">Psalm 106:28-29</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that compromise with sin is never merely personal; it opens a door for national judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And their sister Cozbi, the daughter of the Midianite leader</b><p>&#8226; Cozbi is singled out to show that the scheme was led from the top; her father was &#8220;Zur, a tribal leader of a Midianite family&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/25-15.htm">Numbers 25:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By calling her their &#8220;sister,&#8221; the text highlights the sense of family connection the Midianites offered&#8212;an invitation to belong that masked deadly intent.<p>&#8226; Leadership-level involvement underscores how whole cultures can oppose God by enticing His people away from covenant loyalty (<a href="/micah/6-5.htm">Micah 6:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The woman who was killed on the day the plague came because of Peor</b><p>&#8226;

The plague that struck 24,000 Israelites (<a href="/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9</a>) shows that sin&#8217;s fallout is swift and severe when left unchecked.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s justice and mercy meet here: judgment fell, the plague was halted, and Israel was reminded that holiness cannot be negotiated (<a href="/psalms/106-30.htm">Psalm 106:30-31</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/25-18.htm">Numbers 25:18</a> explains why God ordered Israel to treat Midian as an enemy: Midian&#8217;s leaders used deception, sexual temptation, and idolatry to lure Israel into covenant unfaithfulness, bringing a lethal plague.
