These cities were chosen by God through Moses and later Joshua, emphasizing divine guidance in their selection. The process reflects the importance of justice and mercy in the community. The selection was not arbitrary but based on strategic locations to ensure accessibility for all Israelites, highlighting God's provision for His people.<p><b>will be your six cities of refuge</b><br>The concept of cities of refuge is rooted in the need for justice and protection within the Israelite community. These cities provided asylum for individuals who committed unintentional manslaughter, allowing them to escape the avenger of blood until a fair trial could be conducted. The number six is significant, representing completeness and sufficiency in biblical numerology. These cities were distributed throughout the land, ensuring that they were within reach for all tribes, symbolizing God's justice and mercy. The cities of refuge can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers refuge and salvation to all who seek Him. This provision underscores the balance between justice and mercy, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture, and points to the ultimate refuge found in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_of_refuge.htm">Cities of Refuge</a></b><br>These were designated places where individuals who had accidentally committed manslaughter could seek asylum.
