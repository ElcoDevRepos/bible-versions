The redemption money refers to the silver collected as a ransom for the firstborn of Israel, which was to be given to the priestly family of Aaron. This act underscores the Levitical priesthood's role in Israel's religious life, as Aaron and his sons were set apart for service in the tabernacle. The concept of redemption is central to biblical theology, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who is described as our High Priest in the order of Melchizedek (<a href="/hebrews/5-10.htm">Hebrews 5:10</a>).<p><b>in obedience to the word of the LORD</b><br>Moses' actions demonstrate his faithfulness and obedience to God's commands, a recurring theme in his leadership. This obedience is crucial, as it sets a standard for the Israelites and reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people. The phrase emphasizes the importance of adhering to divine instructions, which is a principle echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings are promised for obedience.<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded him</b><br>This phrase reinforces the idea that Moses acted according to divine instruction, highlighting the authority of God's word. It reflects the biblical principle that God's commands are to be followed precisely, as seen in the detailed instructions for the construction of the tabernacle (Exodus 25-31). This obedience is a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the will of the Father (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>), serving as the ultimate example of submission to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
