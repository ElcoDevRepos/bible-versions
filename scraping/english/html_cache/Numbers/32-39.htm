The Machirites were known for their strength and valor, which is reflected in their ability to conquer territories. This lineage highlights the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing over Joseph's descendants, indicating their future prosperity and strength (<a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>). The tribe of Manasseh was one of the half-tribes that settled on the east side of the Jordan River, showing their significant role in the conquest and settlement of the Promised Land.<p><b>went to Gilead</b><br>Gilead is a region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and rugged terrain. It was a strategic location due to its fertile land and natural resources. The area was historically significant as a place of refuge and conflict. The decision to settle in Gilead reflects the tribe's desire for a land that could sustain their large numbers and livestock, as well as their willingness to engage in battle to secure it.<p><b>captured it</b><br>The capture of Gilead by the descendants of Machir demonstrates their military prowess and God's favor in granting them victory. This act of conquest was part of the broader Israelite campaign to take possession of the land promised to them by God. It also signifies the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs regarding the land of Canaan.<p><b>and drove out the Amorites who were there</b><br>The Amorites were a prominent Canaanite people known for their fortified cities and military strength. The expulsion of the Amorites from Gilead by the Machirites signifies the Israelites' divine mandate to cleanse the land of its previous inhabitants, as commanded in <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>. This act also prefigures the ultimate victory of God's people over their enemies, a theme that resonates throughout the biblical narrative. The driving out of the Amorites can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, securing a place for His people in the eternal Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/machir.htm">Machir</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph.

In the absence of any direct information, we can only guess at the nature of the tie which united the Beni-Machir as a family, and kept them distinct from the other Manassite families. It is evident from their history that they formed a sub-tribe powerful enough to have a name of their own in Israel (cf. verse 40 and <a href="/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>, and see note on verse 41). <span class="cmt_word">Went to Gilead.</span> This would seem to refer to the expedition briefly recorded in chapter Numbers 21:33. It is mentioned here out of place, in the simple historical style of the Pentateuch, because the gift of Gilead to Machir grew out of its conquest by Machir. The name Gilead is again used in a very vague sense, for the territory actually allotted to Machir was rather in Bashan than in Gilead proper. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/32-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The descendants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Machir</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4353.htm">Strong's 4353: </a> </span><span class="str2">Machir -- two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Manasseh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;na&#353;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4519.htm">Strong's 4519: </a> </span><span class="str2">Manasseh -- 'causing to forget', a son of Joseph, also a king of Judah, also two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
