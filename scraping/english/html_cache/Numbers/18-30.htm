The Levites were not given a land inheritance like the other tribes of Israel; instead, they were supported by the tithes and offerings of the people. This command underscores their unique role and the responsibilities that come with it.<p><b>When you have presented the best part</b><br>The Levites were required to offer a portion of the tithes they received to the priests, specifically the best part. This reflects the principle of giving God the first and best of what one has, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>). It emphasizes the importance of honoring God with one's resources and acknowledges His provision.<p><b>it will be reckoned to you</b><br>This phrase indicates that the offering of the best part by the Levites is accounted to them as fulfilling their duty. It suggests a system of accountability and recognition before God, where their obedience in giving is noted and valued. This mirrors the New Testament teaching that God sees and rewards the faithful stewardship of His people (e.g., <a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>).<p><b>as the produce of the threshing floor or winepress</b><br>The threshing floor and winepress were places where grain and grapes were processed, symbolizing the source of sustenance and joy. By comparing the Levites' offering to these, it highlights the significance and value of their contribution. This imagery is also used in prophetic literature to describe God's provision and judgment (e.g., <a href="/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>). It points to the abundance and blessing that come from faithful service and giving.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service in the Tabernacle.
