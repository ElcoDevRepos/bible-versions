This tribe is part of the northern tribes of Israel and is often associated with the region around the Sea of Galilee. In biblical history, Naphtali is known for its warriors and played a significant role in various battles, including those led by Deborah and Barak against Sisera (Judges 4-5). The tribe's territory was fertile and strategically located, which made it significant in the history of Israel. The registration mentioned here is part of a census commanded by God to Moses, which was conducted to organize the Israelites for their journey and eventual conquest of Canaan. This census was specifically for males aged twenty and above who were able to go to war, highlighting the tribe's readiness for military engagement.<p><b>numbered 53,400</b><br>The number 53,400 represents the men of fighting age from the tribe of Naphtali. This figure is significant as it reflects the tribe's size and potential military strength during the wilderness period. The census was crucial for organizing the Israelites into a structured community with defined roles and responsibilities. The number also indicates the growth of the tribe since the time of Jacob, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be numerous. In the broader context of the census in Numbers, this figure contributes to the total number of Israelite warriors, which was essential for the conquest of the Promised Land. The precise counting underscores the importance of order and preparation in God's plan for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naphtali.htm">Naphtali</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Naphtali, the sixth son of Jacob and Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant.
