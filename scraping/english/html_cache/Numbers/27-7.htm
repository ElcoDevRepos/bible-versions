In the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, inheritance typically passed through male descendants. The daughters of Zelophehad&#8212;Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah&#8212;challenged this norm by approaching Moses and the leaders to request their father's inheritance, as he had no sons. This event is a pivotal moment in the biblical narrative, highlighting God's justice and the importance of women's rights within the community. It also sets a precedent for future inheritance laws in Israel, as seen in <a href="/numbers/36.htm">Numbers 36</a> and <a href="/joshua/17.htm">Joshua 17</a>.<p><b>You certainly must give them property as an inheritance among their father&#8217;s brothers</b><br>This command from God through Moses ensures that the daughters receive a portion of land among their father's brothers, thus preserving their father's name and property within the tribe of Manasseh. This decision reflects the broader biblical principle of justice and fairness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>, where God is described as one who "defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow." The allocation of land is crucial in the context of the Promised Land, as it represents not only economic stability but also a tangible connection to God's covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>and transfer their father&#8217;s inheritance to them.</b><br>The transfer of inheritance to the daughters signifies a shift in the legal and cultural practices of the time, allowing for the preservation of family lineage and property rights even in the absence of male heirs. This decision is later codified into Israelite law, as seen in <a href="/numbers/36.htm">Numbers 36</a>, where additional regulations are provided to ensure that such inheritances remain within the tribe. This provision also foreshadows the inclusive nature of God's kingdom, where all believers, regardless of gender or social status, are heirs to the promises of God, as articulated in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28-29</a>. The daughters of Zelophehad can be seen as types of Christ in their role as advocates for justice and righteousness, prefiguring Christ's advocacy for humanity before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zelophehad's_daughters.htm">Zelophehad's Daughters</a></b><br>The daughters of Zelophehad&#8212;Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah&#8212;are central figures in this passage.
