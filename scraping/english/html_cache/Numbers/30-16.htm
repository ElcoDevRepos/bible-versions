The statutes refer to specific laws given by God to Moses, emphasizing the theocratic nature of Israel's governance. The use of "commanded" underscores the non-negotiable nature of these laws, reflecting God's sovereign will. This is consistent with the broader context of the Pentateuch, where Moses frequently acts as the mediator between God and the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/20-19.htm">Exodus 20:19-21</a>). The statutes are part of the covenantal relationship established at Sinai, where God provided laws to guide the moral, ceremonial, and civil life of His people.<p><b>concerning the relationship between a man and his wife</b><br>This part of the verse addresses marital dynamics, specifically the authority and responsibility within a marriage. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, the husband held a leadership role within the family. This reflects the patriarchal structure of society at the time, where the husband was seen as the head of the household (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>). The statutes provided here aim to ensure order and harmony within the family unit, which was foundational to the community's stability. The New Testament echoes this structure, emphasizing mutual love and respect (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-33</a>).<p><b>and between a father and a young daughter still in his home</b><br>This phrase highlights the father's role in the family, particularly concerning his unmarried daughter. In ancient Israel, daughters were under the protection and authority of their fathers until marriage. This reflects the cultural norms of the time, where family honor and lineage were paramount. The father's responsibility included making decisions for his daughter, ensuring her well-being, and arranging her marriage (<a href="/genesis/24.htm">Genesis 24:1-4</a>). This protective role is seen as a type of Christ's care for the Church, where believers are under His authority and protection (<a href="/ephesians/5-29.htm">Ephesians 5:29-30</a>). The statutes provided guidance to maintain family integrity and honor, crucial in a society where family was the primary social unit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who provides statutes and commandments to guide the Israelites in their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of Israel who receives and communicates God's laws to the people.

The earlier fifteen verses specify how vows may be upheld or annulled in a household. By saying &#8220;These are the statutes,&#8221; the text roots those household dynamics in God&#8217;s unchanging moral order, echoing how other covenant commands are introduced (<a href="/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-1.htm">Deuteronomy 4:1-2</a>). Accepted literally, these words settle any debate about whether vow-keeping is optional.<p>Key implications:<p>&#8226;Vows are sacred promises, not casual words (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226;The statutes are comprehensive; nothing is left for human improvisation (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD commanded Moses</b><p>Authority flows from the LORD, through Moses, to Israel. This continues the consistent pattern of revelation&#8212;God speaks, Moses mediates, the people obey (<a href="/leviticus/1-1.htm">Leviticus 1:1-2</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1</a>). By anchoring family order in divine command, the passage safeguards it from cultural whims. Just as Jesus later affirms Moses&#8217; writings as God&#8217;s word (<a href="/mark/7-10.htm">Mark 7:10-13</a>), so we receive this instruction with the same weight today.<p>Takeaways:<p>&#8226;Obedience to family authority structures is obedience to God (<a href="/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18-20</a>).<p>&#8226;The chain of command prevents confusion and protects the vulnerable (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>concerning the relationship between a man and his wife</b><p>Verses 6-15 describe how a husband may confirm or annul his wife&#8217;s vows on the day he hears of them. Far from demeaning the wife, this provision underscores the husband&#8217;s headship and protective role, much like Christ&#8217;s headship over the church (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23-24</a>). If he remains silent, her vow stands, holding him accountable for the household&#8217;s spiritual integrity.<p>Practical insights:<p>&#8226;Headship is service&#8208;oriented leadership, ensuring that vows do not place the family under undue burden (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-28</a>).<p>&#8226;A wife&#8217;s spiritual agency is honored; her words matter enough to require deliberate response from her husband (<a href="/proverbs/31-26.htm">Proverbs 31:26-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and between a father and a young daughter still in his home</b><p>Verses 3-5 address unmarried daughters. While under her father&#8217;s roof, her vows are subject to his immediate confirmation or annulment. The father&#8217;s role mirrors God&#8217;s fatherly concern&#8212;shielding a young woman from impulsive commitments that might harm her future (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>). Once she marries, that responsibility transfers to her husband, preserving continuity of care (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>).<p>Principles to note:<p>&#8226;Parental authority extends to spiritual promises, not merely household chores (<a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226;The provision highlights a father&#8217;s duty to nurture and safeguard his daughter&#8217;s well-being, preparing her for adulthood (<a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/30-16.htm">Numbers 30:16</a> seals the chapter by declaring that every instruction on household vows is a divinely mandated statute. God authorizes Moses to transmit these guidelines, which honor the covenant family structure: husbands lovingly leading wives, fathers protectively guiding daughters. Seen literally, the verse affirms that family headship is not cultural baggage but God&#8217;s gracious design to foster accountability, protection, and harmony within the covenant community, a pattern still affirmed throughout Scripture and relevant for believers today.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/30-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are the statutes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1469;&#1463;&#1495;&#1467;&#1511;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;uq&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
