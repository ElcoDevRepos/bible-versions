The "law of jealousy" is a divine ordinance given to maintain marital fidelity and social order within the Israelite community. It reflects the seriousness with which God views the covenant of marriage, emphasizing the need for trust and faithfulness. This law is unique to the Israelites and underscores the importance of purity and holiness in relationships, as seen in other parts of the Torah.<p><b>when a wife goes astray</b><br>The phrase "goes astray" implies a deviation from the expected path of marital faithfulness. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, marriage was a covenantal relationship with significant social and religious implications. The act of going astray not only threatened the family unit but also the community's moral fabric. This concept is echoed in the prophetic literature, where Israel's unfaithfulness to God is often depicted as spiritual adultery (e.g., <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1-3</a>).<p><b>and defiles herself</b><br>Defilement here refers to the act of adultery, which was considered a serious sin under the Mosaic Law. It not only affected the individual but also had communal repercussions, as purity was a central theme in Israelite worship and daily life. The idea of defilement is linked to the broader biblical theme of holiness, where God calls His people to be set apart and pure (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>).<p><b>while under her husband&#8217;s authority</b><br>This phrase reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society, where the husband held a position of authority within the family. The husband's role was to protect and provide for his wife, and her faithfulness was integral to the household's stability. This authority is not merely social but also spiritual, as the husband is seen as the head of the family, a concept that is further developed in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>). The law of jealousy thus serves to uphold the sanctity of marriage and the proper order within the family as ordained by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God, including the law of jealousy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the law was given, living in the wilderness during their journey to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The religious leader responsible for carrying out the ritual described in the law of jealousy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_husband.htm">The Husband</a></b><br>The man who suspects his wife of infidelity and brings her before the priest.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wife.htm">The Wife</a></b><br>The woman suspected of infidelity, who undergoes the ritual to determine her guilt or innocence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_context_of_the_law.htm">Understanding the Context of the Law</a></b><br>The law of jealousy was given in a specific cultural and historical context where the integrity of family and community was paramount.

The verse teaches that adultery violates covenant, defiles the individual, wounds the community, and offends the jealous holiness of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the law of jealousies.</span> A law prescribed by God, and yet in substance borrowed from half civilized heathens; a practice closely akin to yet prevalent superstitious, and yet receiving not only the toleration of Moses, but the direct sanction of God; an ordeal which emphatically claimed to be infallibly operative through supernatural agencies, yet amongst other nations obviously lending itself to collusion and fraud, as does the trial by red water practiced by the tribes of West Africa. In order to justify heavenly wisdom herein, we must frankly admit, to begin with - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That it was founded upon the superstitious notion that immaterial virtue can be imparted to physical elements. The holiness of the gathered dust and the awfulness of the written curses were both supposed to be held in solution by the water of jealousy. The record does not <span class="accented">say</span> as much, but the whole ordeal proceeds on this supposition, which would undoubtedly be the popular one. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That it was only fitted for a very rude and comparatively barbarous state of society. The Talmud states that the use of it ceased forty years before the destruction of Jerusalem (if so, during our Lord's earthly lifetime); but it may be held certain that it ceased long before - indeed there is no recorded instance of its use. It was essentially an ordeal, although one Divinely regulated, and as such would have been morally impossible and highly undesirable in any age but <span class="cmt_word">one</span> of blind and uninquiring faith. And we find the justification of it exactly in the fact that it was given to a generation which believed much and knew little; which had a profound belief in magic, and no knowledge of natural philosophy. It was ever the wisdom of God, as revealed in the sacred volume, to take men as they were, and to utilize the superstitious notions which could not at once be destroyed, or the imperfect moral ideas which could not at once be reformed, by making them work for righteousness and peace. It is, above all, the wisdom of God not to destroy the imperfect, but to regulate it and restrain its abuses, and so impress it into his service, until he has educated his people for something higher. Everybody knows the extreme violence of jealousy amongst an uncivilized people, and the widespread misery and crime to which it leads. It may safely be affirmed that <span class="accented">any</span> ordeal which should leave no place for jealousy, because no room for uncertainty, would be a blessing to a people rude enough and ignorant enough to believe in it. Ordeals arc established in a certain stage of civilization because they are wanted, and are on the whole useful, as long as they remain in harmony with popular ideas. They are, however, always liable <span class="cmt_word">to</span> two dangers. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> They occasionally fail, and are known to have failed, and so fall into disrepute.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/5-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">is the law</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1463;&#1430;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;w&#183;ra&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8451.htm">Strong's 8451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Direction, instruction, law</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of jealousy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1425;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(haq&#183;q&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
