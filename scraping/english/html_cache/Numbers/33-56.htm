The context is the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land, where they are instructed to drive out the inhabitants and destroy their idols. Failure to do so would result in God treating them as He intended to treat the Canaanites. This reflects the principle of divine justice and the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses are conditional upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>what I had planned to do to them.</b><br>God's plan for the Canaanites was to drive them out of the land due to their idolatry and wickedness (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-28</a>). This phrase underscores the seriousness of God's commands and the consequences of disobedience. It highlights the holiness of God and His intolerance of sin, serving as a reminder of the need for purity and faithfulness. The Israelites are warned that they are not exempt from judgment if they fall into the same sins. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live holy lives, separate from the world (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_canaanites.htm">The Canaanites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the land that God promised to the Israelites.

The threat (although in fact fulfilled) does not necessarily involve any prophecy, since to settle down among the remnants of the heathen was a course of action which would obviously and for many reasons commend itself to the Israelites. Indolence and cowardice were consulted by such a policy as much as the natural feelings of pity towards vanquished and apparently harmless foes. The command to extirpate was certainly justified in this case (if it could be in any) by the unhappy consequences of its neglect. Israel being what he was, and so little severed in anything but religion from the ancient heathen, his only chance of future happiness lay in keeping himself from any contact with them. On the morality of the command itself, see on the passages referred to, and on the slaughter of the Midianites. As a fact, the extirpation of the conquered did not offend the moral sense of the Jews then any more than it did that of our heathen Saxon ancestors. Where both races could not dwell in security, it was a matter of course that the weaker was destroyed. Such a command was therefore justified at that time by the end to be attained, because it was not contrary to the moral law as then revealed, or to the moral sense as then educated. Being in itself a lawful proceeding, it was made a religious proceeding, and taken out of the category of selfish violence by being made a direct command of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/33-56.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I will do to you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1469;&#1462;&#1506;&#1457;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#8216;&#277;&#183;&#347;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I had planned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(dim&#183;m&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1819.htm">Strong's 1819: </a> </span><span class="str2">To compare, to resemble, liken, consider</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to do to them.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/33-56.htm">Numbers 33:56 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/33-56.htm">Numbers 33:56 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/33-56.htm">Numbers 33:56 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/33-56.htm">Numbers 33:56 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/33-56.htm">Numbers 33:56 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/33-56.htm">Numbers 33:56  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/33-56.htm">Numbers 33:56 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/33-56.htm">Numbers 33:56 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/33-56.htm">Numbers 33:56 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/33-56.htm">Numbers 33:56 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/33-56.htm">OT Law: Numbers 33:56 It shall happen that as I thought (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/33-55.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 33:55"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 33:55" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/34-1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 34:1"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 34:1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
