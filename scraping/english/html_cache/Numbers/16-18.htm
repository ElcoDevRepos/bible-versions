The censer, a vessel for burning incense, symbolizes the priestly duties they sought to usurp. The use of censers highlights their attempt to claim a role reserved for the Aaronic priesthood, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-10</a>. This act of taking censers is a direct challenge to God's established order.<p><b>put fire and incense in it</b><br>Fire and incense were integral to the worship practices in the Tabernacle, representing prayers and offerings to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). The act of putting fire and incense in the censers signifies an attempt to present themselves as legitimate priests. However, their unauthorized offering contrasts with the prescribed rituals in <a href="/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12-13</a>, underscoring their rebellion against divine instructions.<p><b>and stood with Moses and Aaron</b><br>Standing with Moses and Aaron at this moment is symbolic of their confrontation and defiance. Moses and Aaron, chosen by God to lead Israel, represent divine authority. The rebels' stance is not just physical but also ideological, challenging the God-ordained leadership. This scene echoes earlier instances of rebellion, such as Miriam and Aaron's challenge in <a href="/numbers/12.htm">Numbers 12</a>, highlighting a recurring theme of opposition to God's chosen leaders.<p><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and God's dwelling among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8-9</a>). Standing at its entrance signifies a critical moment of decision and judgment. This location is significant as it is where God often communicated with Moses (<a href="/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9-11</a>). The rebels' presence here is a direct affront to God's holiness and order, setting the stage for divine intervention and judgment, as seen in the subsequent verses.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah.htm">Korah</a></b><br>A Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, challenging their leadership and the priesthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dathan_and_abiram.htm">Dathan and Abiram</a></b><br>Reubenites who joined Korah in his rebellion, questioning Moses' leadership and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the appointed high priest, representing the priestly line chosen by God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>The sacred place where God met with Moses and the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_god's_appointed_leadership.htm">Respect for God's Appointed Leadership</a></b><br>God establishes leaders for His purposes.
