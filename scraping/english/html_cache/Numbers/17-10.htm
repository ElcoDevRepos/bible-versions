Throughout the Pentateuch, God frequently speaks to Moses, establishing him as the primary mediator between God and the Israelites. This communication underscores the covenant relationship between God and His chosen people.<p><b>Put Aaron&#8217;s staff back in front of the Testimony</b><br>Aaron's staff had miraculously budded, blossomed, and produced almonds as a sign of God's chosen priesthood (<a href="/numbers/17-8.htm">Numbers 17:8</a>). Placing it in front of the Testimony, which refers to the Ark of the Covenant containing the tablets of the Law, signifies its sacred status and serves as a perpetual reminder of God's selection of Aaron's line. The Ark was located in the Most Holy Place, the innermost part of the Tabernacle, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<p><b>to be kept as a sign for the rebellious</b><br>The staff serves as a tangible reminder of the rebellion of Korah and his followers (Numbers 16) and God's decisive response. It acts as a warning against future insurrections and a testament to God's established order. This sign is meant to deter the Israelites from challenging God's appointed leadership.<p><b>so that you may put an end to their grumbling against Me</b><br>The Israelites frequently complained and rebelled during their wilderness journey, often questioning God's plans and provisions. This phrase highlights God's desire to quell dissent and maintain order among His people. The grumbling is not just against Moses and Aaron but ultimately against God Himself, reflecting a lack of faith and trust.<p><b>lest they die</b><br>This serves as a stern warning of the consequences of rebellion against God's ordained authority. The death of Korah and his followers (<a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-35</a>) serves as a recent example of the severe repercussions of such actions. It underscores the seriousness with which God views rebellion and the importance of obedience to His commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who communicates His will and commands to Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to guide His people and convey His messages.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the high priest, whose staff budded as a sign of God's chosen leadership.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_testimony.htm">The Testimony</a></b><br>Refers to the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the tablets of the Law and served as a symbol of God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rebellious.htm">The Rebellious</a></b><br>The Israelites who grumbled against God's chosen leaders, questioning their authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_authority.htm">God's Sovereignty and Authority</a></b><br>God establishes His authority through signs and wonders, as seen in the budding of Aaron's staff.

It is not stated here that the rod was put within the ark. Nor is it so stated in <a href="/exodus/16-33.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.">Exodus 16:33</a> with regard to the pot of manna. Neither of these was within the ark when it was brought into Solomon's temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-9.htm" title="There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.">1Kings 8:9</a>); but this statement is by no means inconsistent with that contained in <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm" title="Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;">Hebrews 9:4</a>, inasmuch as the assertion that there was nothing but the tables of the law in the ark at that time does not prove that there were not other things in it at an earlier period, and may be thought to suggest the inference that such was actually the case. The Jews have a tradition that when King Josiah ordered the ark to be put in the house which King Solomon built, the rod of Aaron and the pot of manna and the anointing oil were hidden with the ark, and that at that time the rod of Aaron had buds and almonds.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before the testimony.</span> By comparison with verse 7 this should mean before the ark in which the "testimony" lay. In <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>, however, the rod is said to have been in the ark, although before Solo-men's time it had disappeared (<a href="/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a>). We may suppose that after it had been inspected by the princes it was deposited for safer preservation and easier conveyance inside the sacred chest. <span class="cmt_word">To be kept for a</span> <span class="cmt_word">token against the rebels.</span> Rather, "against the rebellious," literally, "children of rebellion" (cf. <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2, 3</a>). It could only serve as a token as long as it retained the evidences of having sprouted and fruited, either miraculously in a fresh state, or naturally in a withered state. As a fact, however, it does not appear that the lesson ever needed to be learnt again, and therefore we may suppose that the rod was left first to shrivel with age, and then to be lost through some accident. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/17-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
