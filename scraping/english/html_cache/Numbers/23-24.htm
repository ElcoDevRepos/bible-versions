The lioness is a symbol of power and ferocity, often used in ancient Near Eastern cultures to represent might and dominance. In the biblical context, this imagery underscores the divine empowerment of Israel as they prepare to enter the Promised Land. The lioness rising suggests an awakening or mobilization, indicating that the Israelites are ready to take action under God's guidance. This can be connected to the promises given to the patriarchs, such as in <a href="/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>, where Judah is likened to a lion, foreshadowing the tribe's leadership and strength.<p><b>they rouse themselves like a lion,</b><br>The lion is a symbol of royalty and authority, often associated with kingship in the ancient world. This phrase suggests self-motivation and readiness for battle, highlighting the Israelites' confidence and determination. The lion's rousing can be seen as a metaphor for Israel's preparation to fulfill God's promises. This imagery is also prophetic, pointing to the future Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the Lion of the tribe of Judah in <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>, symbolizing His ultimate authority and victory.<p><b>not resting until they devour their prey</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the relentless pursuit and determination of the Israelites. The imagery of not resting until the prey is devoured indicates a complete and thorough victory, which is assured by God's promise. Historically, this reflects the numerous battles Israel would face in conquering Canaan, where they were often outnumbered but victorious through divine intervention. This relentless pursuit can also be seen as a type of Christ's mission, who did not rest until He accomplished the work of salvation.<p><b>and drink the blood of the slain.&#8221;</b><br>Drinking the blood of the slain is a vivid image of total conquest and victory. In ancient warfare, this phrase would symbolize the complete defeat of enemies. Culturally, it reflects the practices of the time where victory was often celebrated with feasting and spoils. Biblically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ. The imagery also connects to the sacrificial system, where blood was a significant element, pointing to Christ's sacrifice and the new covenant in His blood, as mentioned in <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet hired by Balak to curse Israel.

Balaam, though pressured by Balak to curse Israel, can only speak what the Lord gives him (<a href="/numbers/23-8.htm">Numbers 23:8, 12</a>). The moment draws our eyes to God&#8217;s perspective, not man&#8217;s. It echoes earlier moments when God says &#8220;Behold&#8221; to introduce a divine assessment&#8212;such as His protective promise in <a href="/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a> or His covenant assurance in <a href="/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4</a>. Here, God commands us to look at His people through His eyes of blessing, not through the fearful lens of their enemies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people rise like a lioness</b><p>Israel is pictured as a lioness&#8212;fierce, protective, agile. After centuries of slavery (<a href="/bsb/exodus/1.htm">Exodus 1&#8211;12</a>) and the long wilderness trek, the nation is now on its feet, ready to claim God&#8217;s promises (<a href="/joshua/1-2.htm">Joshua 1:2-3</a>). This rising is not merely military; it is spiritual awakening, confidence born from covenant. Cross references reinforce the image: <a href="/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a> calls Judah &#8220;a lion&#8217;s cub,&#8221; forecasting royal strength; <a href="/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a> predicts Israel among the nations &#8220;like a lion among the beasts of the forest.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they rouse themselves like a lion</b><p>The lion, king of beasts (<a href="/proverbs/30-30.htm">Proverbs 30:30</a>), awakens with purpose. Israel&#8217;s &#8220;rousing&#8221; shows God-given courage for the battles ahead. <a href="/joshua/10-25.htm">Joshua 10:25</a> captures this spirit: &#8220;Do not be afraid or discouraged. Be strong and courageous, for the Lord will do this to all the enemies you fight.&#8221; As the lion shakes off sleep, so Israel shakes off fear, empowered by the presence of the Lord in their midst (<a href="/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35-36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not resting until they devour their prey</b><p>The phrase underscores perseverance. Israel&#8217;s conquest will not stall midway; God guarantees complete victory (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22-24</a>). Like a lion pursuing prey, the nation will keep advancing until every promise is fulfilled. This mirrors the assurance in <a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>: &#8220;I will send My terror ahead of you and throw into confusion every nation you encounter.&#8221; God&#8217;s people are called to persistent obedience, trusting that the Lord fights for them (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-17.htm">2 Chronicles 20:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and drink the blood of the slain.</b><p>While vivid, this line speaks of total triumph rather than literal cruelty. In ancient warfare imagery, &#8220;drinking blood&#8221; depicts the finality of victory (<a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-20.htm">Revelation 14:20</a>). The verse emphasizes that no opponent can stand when God determines the outcome (<a href="/numbers/24-8.htm">Numbers 24:8-9</a>). It foreshadows ultimate deliverance accomplished through Christ, the Lion of Judah (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>), whose decisive victory over sin and death ensures the security of God&#8217;s people forever.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a> presents Israel as a lioness awakened by God&#8217;s blessing&#8212;rising, rousing, advancing, and prevailing until every enemy is subdued. The imagery assures believers that when God declares His favor, no curse or opposition can derail His purposes. Our calling is to stand up, shake off fear, and move forward in confident obedience, knowing the Lord has already secured the outcome.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">As a great lion.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">as a lioness. </span>(Comp. <a href="/genesis/49-9.htm" title="Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, you are gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?">Genesis 49:9</a>.)

The rising of a lion from its covert was one of the most common of the more striking phenomena of nature in those regions, and the imagery it afforded was in constant use; but in truth it is evident that these similes are borrowed from Jacob's dying prophecy concerning Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>), in which the word "prey" (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;</span>, a torn thing) is also found.
