Throughout the Pentateuch, Moses is depicted as a prophet who communicates God's will to the people. This underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. The phrase also highlights the direct communication between God and Moses, which is a unique aspect of Moses' leadership. This divine guidance is crucial for maintaining order and justice among the Israelites.<p><b>Moses commanded the Israelites</b><br>Moses, as the leader and mediator of the covenant, is responsible for implementing God's instructions. His role is not just administrative but also spiritual, guiding the Israelites in their relationship with God. This command reflects the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where civil and religious laws are intertwined. Moses' leadership is a type of Christ, who also mediates a new covenant and leads His people according to God's will.<p><b>The tribe of the sons of Joseph</b><br>This refers to the descendants of Joseph, specifically the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. Joseph's sons were given a special inheritance, reflecting Joseph's favored status among Jacob's sons. The mention of this tribe is significant because it highlights the importance of maintaining tribal inheritances, which were crucial for preserving the identity and stability of the Israelite community. The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh played significant roles in the history of Israel, with Ephraim often representing the northern kingdom.<p><b>Speaks correctly</b><br>The context here involves a legal matter concerning inheritance laws for daughters, as raised by the daughters of Zelophehad. The phrase "speaks correctly" indicates that their concern is valid and aligns with God's justice. This acknowledgment by Moses, under divine instruction, shows the adaptability of the law to address specific situations, ensuring fairness and equity. It also demonstrates the importance of listening to legitimate concerns within the community, a principle that resonates with the broader biblical theme of justice and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.

Only after hearing from the LORD does he respond. That phrase anchors the passage in divine authority, reminding us that:<p>&#8226; Every decision about inheritance and justice came straight from God&#8217;s mouth (<a href="/numbers/27-5.htm">Numbers 27:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel could move forward confidently because &#8220;the word of the LORD is upright&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-4.htm">Psalm 33:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Even Moses, the greatest prophet of his day, never acted independently (<a href="/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b> Moses&#8217; posture underscores a timeless principle: leadership listens first, then acts. The same pattern appears in <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a> when the early church heard the Spirit before sending missionaries.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moses commanded the Israelites</b><p>Once God spoke, Moses turned revelation into instruction. His role was to translate heaven&#8217;s verdict into boots-on-the-ground obedience.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Moses relayed to them all that the LORD had said&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-32.htm">Exodus 34:32</a>).<p>&#8226; He expected prompt action, just as later Joshua would command the people at the Jordan &#8220;according to all that Moses had commanded&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; By issuing a command, Moses treated God&#8217;s word as non-negotiable, preserving unity and preventing inter-tribal conflict (<a href="/numbers/30-1.htm">Numbers 30:1</a>).<p>This flow&#8212;God speaks, Moses commands, people obey&#8212;builds a culture where Scripture governs every arena, including civil matters like land ownership (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-1.htm">Deuteronomy 4:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks correctly</b><p>God affirms that the concern raised by Manasseh&#8217;s leaders is valid. The daughters of Zelophehad (<a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1&#8211;7</a>) could inherit, but if they married outside the tribe, the land would shift permanently. The LORD confirms the tribe&#8217;s insight and then provides a practical safeguard (<a href="/numbers/36-6.htm">Numbers 36:6&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine affirmation shows God values thoughtful, righteous appeals (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>; <a href="/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Tribal boundaries mattered because they preserved each family&#8217;s place in the covenant promise (<a href="/bsb/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13-19</a>).<p>&#8226; God honors both individual rights (the daughters&#8217; inheritance) and communal integrity (the tribe&#8217;s portion).<p>By declaring, &#8220;The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks correctly,&#8221; the LORD models a balanced approach: listen, weigh, affirm truth, and then legislate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/36-5.htm">Numbers 36:5</a> marks a pivotal moment where God validates a legitimate concern and turns it into law. The verse teaches that decisions anchored in God&#8217;s word bring clarity, leaders must transmit that word faithfully, and righteous appeals find a hearing with the LORD. The land stayed with the tribe, the daughters kept their inheritance, and Israel saw again that Scripture speaks authoritatively into every detail of life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the Lord.--</span>In regard to the application made by the daughters of Zelophehad to Moses and Eleazar and the princes, it is said that "Moses brought their cause before the Lord" (<a href="/numbers/27-5.htm" title="And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.">Numbers 27:5</a>).
