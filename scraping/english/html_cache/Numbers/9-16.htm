It also foreshadows the New Testament promise of the Holy Spirit's continual presence with believers (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>).<p><b>the cloud would cover the tabernacle by day,</b><br>The cloud symbolized God's glory and presence, often referred to as the Shekinah glory. This protective covering provided shade and guidance, much like the pillar of cloud that led the Israelites out of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). The tabernacle, as the dwelling place of God among His people, was central to Israelite worship and community life. The cloud's presence over the tabernacle signified God's approval and His role as the leader of His people.<p><b>and at night it would appear like fire.</b><br>The appearance of fire at night provided light and warmth, symbolizing God's protection and guidance even in darkness. Fire is a frequent biblical symbol of God's presence, as seen in the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) and the tongues of fire at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-3.htm">Acts 2:3</a>). This dual manifestation of cloud and fire underscores God's unchanging nature and His ability to meet the needs of His people in every circumstance. It also prefigures Christ as the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), who guides and protects His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were journeying through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt.
