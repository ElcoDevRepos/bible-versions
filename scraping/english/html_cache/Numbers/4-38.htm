The Levites were set apart for the service of the Tabernacle, and each family had specific duties. The numbering of the Gershonites here is part of a larger census of the Levites, which was distinct from the general census of the Israelites. This census was for those who would serve in the Tabernacle, specifically males from thirty to fifty years old, indicating a period of prime physical capability for the demanding tasks involved. The act of numbering signifies the importance of order and organization in the service of God, reflecting the structured nature of worship and service in the Israelite community.<p><b>by their clans and families</b><br>The mention of clans and families highlights the importance of familial and tribal identity in ancient Israel. Each clan and family had a role and responsibility, emphasizing the communal nature of worship and service. This structure ensured that the duties of the Tabernacle were distributed fairly and efficiently among the Levites. The family unit was central to Israelite society, and this organization reflects the broader biblical theme of God working through families and tribes, as seen in the promises to Abraham and the twelve tribes of Israel. The detailed recording of these families also underscores the historical reliability of the biblical narrative, providing a genealogical record that connects the Israelites to their ancestors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_gershon.htm">Sons of Gershon</a></b><br>Gershon was the eldest son of Levi, and his descendants were responsible for the care of the tabernacle's curtains, coverings, and other fabric elements.

anchors us in the flow of the chapter, coming right after the census of the Kohathites (<a href="/numbers/4-1.htm">Numbers 4:1-37</a>).<p>&#8226; It shows God&#8217;s orderly progression&#8212;first Kohath, <b>then</b> Gershon, later Merari (<a href="/numbers/4-44.htm">Numbers 4:44</a>).<p>&#8226; The sequence reminds us that each clan&#8217;s assignment fits into a larger plan, echoing <a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>, &#8220;everything must be done in a proper and orderly manner.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The timing also underlines that God&#8217;s instructions build step-by-step, much like <a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16-17</a> records Moses following every command &#8220;just as the LORD had commanded him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Gershonites</b><p>Gershon was Levi&#8217;s firstborn (<a href="/genesis/46-11.htm">Genesis 46:11</a>);

Their camp location was on the west side, behind the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/3-23.htm">Numbers 3:23</a>), symbolizing shelter and covering&#8212;fitting for men who carried coverings.<p>&#8226;
