The act of writing curses on a scroll signifies the formal and serious nature of the ritual. Writing was a significant skill in ancient times, often associated with authority and permanence. The curses refer to the specific consequences outlined in the preceding verses for a woman suspected of infidelity. This practice underscores the importance of written records in legal and religious matters, as seen in other parts of the Bible, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/27-3.htm">Deuteronomy 27:3</a>, where the law is written on stones.<p><b>and wash them off into the bitter water.</b><br>The washing off of the curses into the bitter water is a symbolic act. The bitter water, a mixture of holy water and dust from the tabernacle floor, represents divine judgment and truth. This ritual reflects the belief in God's direct involvement in revealing truth and administering justice. The concept of bitter water can be connected to other biblical instances where water is used as a means of testing or purification, such as in <a href="/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23-25</a>, where bitter water is made sweet. The use of water in this context also prefigures the cleansing and purifying work of Jesus Christ, who offers living water (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>) that cleanses from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>A representative of God who performs the ritual.

The written word moves from parchment to potion, declaring that the Lord sees what humans cannot. Innocence will leave the water inert; guilt will make it bitter indeed. The passage reassures us that God&#8217;s justice is precise, personal, and unfailing, protecting the innocent while exposing the hidden works of darkness (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In a book.</span> On a roll. <span class="cmt_word">Blot</span> <span class="cmt_word">them out with the bitter water.</span> Rather, "wash them off into the bitter water," in order to transfer the venom of the curses to the water. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f54;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, Septuagint. The writing on the scroll was to be washed off in the vessel of water. Of course the only actual consequence was that the ink was mixed with the water, but in the imagination of the people, and to the frightened conscience of a guilty woman, the curses were also held in solution in the water of trial. The direction was founded on a world-wide superstition, still prevalent in Africa, and indeed amongst most semi-barbarous peoples. In the 'Romance of Setnan,' translated by Brugsch. Bey, the scene of which is laid in the time of Rameses the Great, a magical formula written on a papyrus leaf is dissolved in water, and drunk with the effect of imparting all its secrets to him that drinks it. So in the present day, by a similar superstition, do sick Mahomedans swallow texts of the Koran; and so in the middle ages the canonized Archbishop Edmund Rich (1240) on his death-bed washed a crucifix in water and drank it, saying, "Ye shall drink water from the wells of salvation." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/5-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
